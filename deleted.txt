Deleted: =sayd To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself—that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word—doublethink—involved the use of doublethink. by Master9000

I’m having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body.

What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier. by Master9000

Deleted: Murphy's Ten Laws for String Theorists: 

(1) If you fix a mistake in a mathematical superstring calculation, another one will show up somewhere else. 
(2) If your results are based on the work of others, then one such work will turn out to be wrong.
(3) The longer your article, the more likely your computer hard disk drive will fail while you are typing the references.
(4) The better your research result, the more likely it will be rejected by the referee of a journal; on the other hand, if your work is wrong but not obviously so, it will be accepted for publication right away. 
(5) If a result seems to good to be true, it is unless you are one of the top ten string theorists in the world. (By the way, these theorists refer to their results as "string miracles".) 
(6) Your most startling string-theoretic theorem will turn out to be valid in only two spatial dimensions or less.
(7) When giving a string seminar, nobody will follow anything you say after the first minute, but, if miraculously someone does, then that person will point out a flaw in your reasoning half-way through your talk and what will be worse is that your grant review officer will happen to be in the audience.
(8) For years, nobody will ever notice the fudge factors in your calculations, but when you come up for tenure they will surface like fish being tossed fresh breadcrumbs. 
(9) If you are a graduate student working on string theory, then the field will be dead by the time you get your Ph.D.; Even worse, if you start over with a new thesis topic, the new field will also be dead by the time you get your Ph.D. 
(10) If you discover an interesting string model, then it will predict at least one low-energy, observable particle not seen in Nature. by Master9000

Deleted: The road to Pink Nu is a long one.  The question is if it is rewarding.  To some, getting this far is a sign that you have wasted your time just talking.  To others, it shows that you are willing to stay around, talk, and get to know other members of the server.  However, neither of these are the exact truth.  How you interpret a rank up is yours to choose as it is for everyone else.  The important thing is to not argue about who is right or wrong.  There is no right or wrong here.  Even when Pink Nu is obtained, the road isn't technically over.  It is merely the halfway point. by SuperDragonite2172

Discord has changed their Terms of Service!

Unfortunately, this change comes with a revocation of your legal rights. Discord has revoked your right to sue (you must go through an arbitrator) and to congregate as a class action lawsuit.

Luckily, there is an opt-out for the clause, in which you must email arbitration-opt-out@discord.com, but you must do it within 30 days or you can no longer opt-out.

YOU CANNOT DELETE OR DEACTIVATE YOUR ACCOUNT TO OPT-OUT OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE

You can see the added clauses for yourself here: https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/c93697c9d59ec2f0d8071b7d0e907632

I will attempt to answer some common questions.

Is this enforceable?

In the United States, yes. This was decided by the Supreme Court in 2011.

In Europe, no. There are many clauses, a relevant one is Article 77 of the GDPR ("Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority").

Why does this matter?

Without the ability to congregate for a class action lawsuit, if Discord ever leaks your data or does something catastrophically bad to a large portion of the population you have no way to representatively sue together without each of you individually suing via the arbitrator. 



Essentially: 

1. Your right to file a complaint in the court of law is removed. 
2. The arbitration system tends to heavily favour the company rather than the consumer.
3. Since your right to pool similar complaints together is taken away, the amount of damage you can do to a company that has wronged you significantly is limited to those who are willing to arbitrate.

Deleted: Rise up 
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When’s it gonna get me?
In my sleep, seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin’, do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I’d live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin’ fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that’s plenty by Master9000
Deleted: I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin’ ‘n fightin’

Are we a nation of states what’s the state of our nation? by Master9000
Deleted: Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I’m with you, but the situation is fraught
You’ve got to be carefully taught
If you talk, you’re gonna get shot by Master9000
Deleted: Oh, am I talkin’ too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth by Master9000
Deleted: If they don’t, grab a friend, that’s your second
Your lieutenant when there’s reckoning to be reckoned by Master9000
Deleted: The challenge, demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action by Master9000
Deleted: they don’t reach a peace, that’s alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility
You have him turn around so he can have deniability by Master9000

sent to me by Alumni

Look out for a Discord user by the name of "potatotailbaka07" with the tag #6710. He is going around sending friend requests to random Discord users, and those who accept his friend requests will have their accounts DDoSed and their groups exposed with the members inside it becoming a victim aswell. Spread the word and send this to as many discord servers as you can. If you see this user, DO NOT accept his friend request and immediately block him.
Our team is currently working very hard to remove this user from our database, please stay safe.

Deleted: How does Hamilton, an arrogant immigrant, orphan
Bastard, whore's son
Somehow endorse Thomas Jefferson, his enemy
A man he’s despised since the beginning
Just to keep me from winning?
I wanna be in the room where it happens
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
You’ve kept me from the room where it happens
For the last time
Dear Alexander
I am slow to anger
But I toe the line
As I reckon with the effects
Of your life on mine
I look back on where I failed
And in every place I checked
The only common thread has been your disrespect
Now you call me amoral
A dangerous disgrace
If you’ve got something to say, name a time and place, face-to-face
I have the honor to be your obedient servant
A-dot-Burr
Mr. Vice President
I am not the reason no one trusts you
No one knows what you believe
I will not equivocate on my opinion
I have always worn it on my sleeve
Even if I said what you think I said
You would need to cite a more specific grievance
Here’s an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements
Sweet Jesus!
Hey, I have not been shy
I am just a guy in the public eye
Tryin’ to do my best for our republic, I don’t wanna fight
But I won’t apologize for doing what’s right
I have the honor to be your obedient servant
A-dot-Ham
Careful how you proceed, good man
Intemperate indeed, good man
Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or prepare to bleed, good man
Burr, your grievance is legitimate
I stand by what I said, every bit of it
You stand only for yourself, it’s what you do
I can’t apologize because it’s true
Then stand, Alexander
Weehawken, dawn
Guns drawn
You’re on
I have the honor to be your obedient servant
A dot Ham

It is suspected to be hollow, allowing for the gravity similar to Earth while being so much larger.  It has two moons, known as the Mist Moon, which orbits every 28 days, and the second is an artificial moon known by natives as "The False".  It is one of many planes of existence in this multiverse.

Deleted: You get nothing if you wait for it wait for it wait for four years make yourself think that you have a master plan to get with her to swoo and woo across the days and slowly get inside. Well that my friend is not the case for if you really tried, results you would have gotten by now rather than being barely an outer shell electron in that social covalent bond. Perhaps I merely fell for the first thing that I saw and liked on that first day while new in town. There's plenty of other presentable people, but the gaze narrowed and focused on her. That same train of thought intentionally derailed itself to thinking that good grades and nothing else would win, that the chill kid with a quick wit would come in and win it. That's not the case. You just gave yourself a nexus to tunnel vision upon when the star you gazed upon was never there at all. The light you see just an ancient output from a chance long gone yet still providing you with a placebo of hope and warmth. If you really wanted that life you would've done something to try to get it instead of going home every day sheltered from the world to play the same damn game for four years straight. That beacon of hope was a sirens call, too bright to see the flaws if they existed and enough to keep you allured to get through the worst of what was around you through blind faith that it would happen. Now having realize that the light you followed for four has less of a chance of being attained than a zero kelvin hydrogen in hell, will you continue the perilous journey forward for fear or something other than the status quo mold you've fit yourself so far into? by Master9000

Deleted: Ok so in that argument that Jesus is the only thing that can save people from their sins, why the fuck do they need saving? Are the egos of these christian airheads so puffed up that they can’t stand to admit the fact that they’re not perfect? There’s no gavel at the end of it all, you just cease to exist. It’s simply beyond comprehension to not be. Just as you don’t recall feeling before you were conceived, so too will nothing be felt when gone. There’s no magical gateway at the end to heaven, and if there was, I would hardly want the justice system to be so poorly set up, especially by the guy who created all the horrible shit we had to deal with that made us imperfect by his fucking standards. An imaginary man being rendered out of the sky into a human form just to be executed did not stop 2000 more years of fighting over your fear of death nonsense with record rates of mass murder. by Master9000

Its pretty tough be both running things up above and down here as you may well tell.   will be putting myself down to crown prince for the meantime.

but she was from school
so I thought it was nice
until it turned out she was a drama queen psycho
and it wasn't good for my psychologically
so I tried to get her out of my life
and she made me feel guilty about it and stuff
and its all just ugh to me at this point
I try not to let it bring me down, cos lets face it, I don't even really know her
and it takes a lot of energy away from ya, so I wanna be free for as long as possible, before actually commiting by SuperGummying

Yeast is a great candidate to become the mascot for the server, as he has a big throbbing heart and will act as the pillar of the community, drawing us closer as a result. I think you should really consider Yeast.
