Oh, good, more of those.
How goes the investigation?
That's absurd. Come on now.
Good observation. What else?
Any luck finding the Butcher?
Please, tell me you have good news.
Now that's interesting. Tell me more.
Oh, Friga Shatter-Shield's old place?
So what do you think about it all, then?
I hate to admit it, but you're probably right.
Nobody else would even know which end to hold.
I don't see why someone would actually use them.
Are you joking? Even I wouldn't sell something like that.
Sorry, I don't know anything about those kinds of things.
Frankly, whoever keeps taking them down should get a medal.
Doesn't mean anything to me. Got an unusual shine to it, though.
I'd take it to Calixto. He's got a good eye for pieces like that.
If I were you, I'd go straight to the steward with this information.
Did you know Viola Giordano wanted to put one of them on my front door?
If you want to ask her about them, good luck. But I'm not going near her.
More of those things. Bah. Viola Giordano's been putting them all around the city.
[QUOTE]Everyone will see it![QUOTE] she said. Of course! That was my problem with it.
Of course, of course. But such things are valuable, and usually falling apart anyway.
Well, come back when you have some more evidence. I think you're on the trail, though.
The one who sells things, what's his name. Oh, yes! Revyn Sadri. Maybe he'd know something.
He usually knows what's going in and out of that place. Thankfully that means I don't have to.
Not very good quality, is it? Probably came from the Gray Quarter. Have a talk with Revyn Sadri.
They definitely have some magic in them, I can tell you that much. But it's nothing I know about.
What made you think I was to blame in the first place? I've actually been after the killer myself.
I don't know if I've ever seen any of those before. I've heard about them, though. Sorry, can't help you.
Although... that court wizard does all manner of experiments. And I know he owns some truly strange things.
Looks like something one of the dark elves would wear. Ask Revyn Sadri, he probably sold whatever it used to be.
Well, since she's not using it anymore, Ulfric might just let you have it, if you have the money. And if he likes you.
Nothing anybody I know would wear. Maybe ask one of the Dark Elves, they usually have some kind of rag falling off of them.
Or you could head over to the family and see if they'll let you in. But I wouldn't want to do that myself. Bad luck over there.
Must be my imagination.
Damn ears... playing tricks on me again. Can't stand this sea air!
Naw, mostly just froze.
I went out ice fishing a few days ago.
Brave man, with the Blackbloods out there. Did you catch anything?
Well, keep at it. The fish have to get to know you before they're willing to bite.
No, I certainly didn't!
Is there a reason you're asking me?
I... see. And is this something I'll need to worry about in the future?
Oh, certainly I hope not! That would be quite unfortunate for my research.
I say, you didn't hear any loud noises last night, did you? No, ahh... explosion sounds?
No, certainly not. A small experiment may have gone awry, but clearly with no discernable consequences.
No. It's not. Trust me.
Trust is hard to come by here, but all right.
Not here. Come with me.
Well, what is it you want?
Stay close and the guards will leave you alone.
I suppose you're here to extort something from me? Is that it?
Not like that it isn't.
The stone was pried off of Barenziah's ceremonial crown by a thief in order to cover his tracks.
Nothing I can't handle.
Kjeld bothering you again?
Well, you send that blowhard to me if he steps over the line.
Oh, thank you my chief!
My chief, Gharol threatens to have me work in the mines. You won't allow my pretty hands to dirty, will you?
No, my wife. You have been given other gifts to please your chief than mine work. I will talk to Gharol and all will be well.
Oh, that sounds lovely.
Care to try out a new ring, or perhaps my daughter could make you a necklace...
Opportunities for what?
I do hope it's true. So many opportunities...
Is it true? Are there really dragons in Skyrim?
There's talk of it, but I find it hard to believe.
What? Oh, nothing. It's just... It's an interesting development.
Perhaps. But not today.
Nearly thirty years, now.
One of these days he'll have to learn.
How long have you run this place, again?
Just wondering when you'll be ready to give it up and settle down. Seems like you're always working.
I just feel like if I'm not here, then something could go wrong. Nils is a hard worker, but I wouldn't trust him to run things.
Please excuse the mess.
What're you looking at?
Give those pirates what for!
We're so grateful for your help.
She's probably the one you ought to talk to.
Let me know when you've learned more about the pirates.
If you get me the logbook, I'll have proof of Shatter-Shield's treachery.
Please, enough already!
Morthal has enough problems as it is!
What's the Jarl going to do about it?
We've no need for wizards in our midst!
Bah, it's no use. Let's get back to it, then.
How are we supposed to feel safe in our own homes?
I have told Idgrod of your concerns. She'll look after you all. Please, go back to your business.
Really? I hope it hurt.
Yeah. You beat people up.
Hmph. Good. That'll teach 'em.
Good. Let's hope it's a lesson learned.
I'll pay you to hurt someone else. Okay?
I heard you attacked someone in town recently.
Heard you hit somebody in town not too long ago.
I heard about what you did. You hurt someone. Bad.
I heard you hurt someone in town not too long ago.
I'd like to pay you to hurt somebody else. For me.
They're dead? But now everyone will think I did it!
Yeah. Uh, I know you hurt someone in town recently.
I need someone to do that to someone. I'll even pay.
You know, I'll pay you to attack one of my enemies...
I'll pay to do the same, to a certain special someone.
Were there tears? I hope everyone can see the bruises.
Got someone I want you to hurt. Don't worry, I can pay.
You what? Oh. That. Good. I hope there was a lot of blood.
Good. Maybe things will be different around here from now on.
Thought you might be open to doing it again... for a tidy sum.
What have you done? You weren't supposed to murder anyone! Gods...
Really? What did you go and do that for? You... you need to go away.
Good. I hope it hurt a lot, after all the pain I've been put through.
Ha! There's nothing like a few cuts and bruises to drive home a point, huh?
It can't be traced back to me, can it? Was there lot's of crying? I hope so.
Really? Good. Was there a lot of screaming? Never mind. I don't want to know.
So you like to hurt people, huh? The town is still talking about what you did.
Dead? No, no, no, no, no! This is terrible. I don't know you. Get away from me!
No! Tell me you're joking. Sweet Mara, what have I done? Go away. Just go away.
I got someone who deserves a beating, but I need someone else to do it for me. I can pay.
Good. Wait. Dead? That's not what I asked for. I... uh... you should leave. I need a drink...
Uh... yeah. I know you don't mind hurting people. Just look what you did to... well, you know.
Oh gods, what did you do that for? This is horrible. I'm not paying for murder. Get away from me.
Idiot! That wasn't the deal. You were just supposed to teach them a lesson. I am not paying you...
What have you done? They'll think I did it. Wait, I did do it! I'm not paying you! This is all your fault!
Shor's bones! What did you do that for? I would have hired the Dark Brotherhood if I'd wanted that! Get away from me.
So many things lost....
Why am I not surprised?
Pfft. Ungrateful milk drinker.
Well, I never claimed otherwise.
Something wrong, Ahlam?
What's wrong, dear friend? You seem... distracted today.
Are you alright, Ahlam? You haven't seemed yourself today.
Oh, you are terrible. You do know that, right? Ha ha ha ha ha.
Let those soldiers come here! You've never seen me throw incense. I could fell a giant.
It's nothing, I just... It's Nazeem. How did we get to this point, Danica? Is there no love left between us?
But it's more than that. Nazeem is obsessed with this civil war, as is all of Skyrim. I swear, it will consume us all.
Maybe Nazeem's obsession has merit. This civil war seems so big, so unceasing... I'm afraid, Danica. Afraid for us all.
If you don't mind me saying so, Ahlam, your husband is a damn fool. Any moment spent thinking about him is a moment wasted.
Ha! Well, when you put it like that, it certainly puts things into perspective. But enough wallowing. And thank you, Danica.
Now, now, my friend. You must look on the bright side. If soldiers storm the city, there's a good chance your husband may get killed.
Hmm? Oh, well... To be honest, I was just thinking of Nazeem. The gap between us seems to be widening. He is just so... self-absorbed.
Oh, it's Nazeem. He's been spending more and more time fawning over the Jarl. I swear, we're hardly ever home at the same time anymore.
Ahlam, let's be honest. Your husband is an arrogant, domineering buffoon. These are the words you used to describe him to me... remember?
Oh dearest, who cares? So your husband is a lout. The work you do here, with me, is invaluable. The people of Whiterun know your true worth.
Soon, my dearest. Soon.
I'm arranging a job for you, but I need some more time. For now, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over.
Speak, and then begone.
What further business do you have with us?
Do the right thing. Paarthurnax deserves to die.
We have nothing to talk about until Paarthurnax is dead.
You have made your choice, Dragonborn. You are not welcome here.
You shouldn't be here, unless you've decided to bring Paarthurnax to justice.
My oath binds me, Dragonborn. Until Paarthurnax is dead, you aren't welcome here.
We have nothing to say to each other. Paarthurnax's murder is beyond my powers of forgiveness.
If not for Paarthurnax, Alduin could not have been overthrown. It was he that first taught men to use the Thu'um.
Yes. But understand - during the days of Alduin's rule, all dragons were his allies. There was nothing else they could be.
Stay away from Camilla.
Just stay away from her, or...or else.
Ah, Camilla. Fair as the morning sun. But I ask you, how could she prefer your brooding to my romantic tunes?
That is a lot of blood.
I really got myself into it this time.
Hello? You! Over here! Please, I need help!
Please, do you have a potion you can spare?
Please! I'm not sure I'll make it on my own.
Not sure how much longer I can hold out here.
That's right. It isn't.
That's so sweet of you.
Why thank, you... you're very kind. Still interested?
I'll tell you what... I'll play a special song, just for you, for no charge at all.
The man doing your job?
Watch your mouth with me you pup! Who do you think you are?
I swear that woman Aeri doesn't appreciate all the work I do for her damn mill.
Oh, I've heard this one before. Watch out Divines, poor Kodrir curses you all for giving him life!
The ritual is complete.
There goes another one.
You hear that? The others must have found something!
Bah. Weak-willed rabble. Even dead they're almost useless.
These thralls of yours are slower than Argonians in a blizzard.
We'd better go see. These can tend to themselves for a few minutes.
They seem less intelligent each time you raise them, if that's even possible.
Feel free to grab a pick and help them out. I prefer not to sully myself with manual labor.
As long as they can swing a pickaxe where I tell them, they're as smart as we need them to be.
This doesn't look good.
Dragonborn... it's an honor.
I'm glad you're on our side.
We'd better find out what's happened.
Shor's bones, did it kill them all...?
You really think we can kill a dragon?
Good luck. I hope you get there in time.
You saved Whiterun today. We won't forget.
Come on, I want a better look at that thing.
I can't believe we actually killed a dragon!
Hold on. I want to hear what Irileth's saying.
I hope the tower holds out until we get there.
I doubt any of us are coming back from this mission.
Get under cover! The dragon - it's still around somewhere!
I'm glad you're coming with us. They say Talos favors you.
I'm looking forward to testing myself against this dragon.
We taught that dragon not to mess with Whiterun, didn't we?
We'd better keep moving. Who knows what that dragon is doing.
My cousin's stationed out at the watchtower. I hope he's all right.
With Irileth, you either come back covered with glory or not at all.
You sure took care of that dragon. Dragonborn or not, that's good enough for me.
I hear you faced a dragon at Helgen and lived to tell about it. That ain't nothing.
That dragon should've stuck with killing Imperials. Now he's going to learn how real Nords fight.
I'm proud to be your battle-brother, Dragonborn. Whiterun doesn't need to fear with you on our side.
Vengeance for Laelette!
I want vengeance for my wife!
We're marching on Movarth's Lair whether you come with us or not.
Wait just one moment...
Oh yes. Oh yes, indeed.
Buy it? This? An Elder Council amulet?
You bring that back to your lovely mistress. With my regards.
Here. It's a letter of credit. Usable, by Astrid only, for any service or item I can provide. As per our standard arrangement.
We never saw him again.
About a year or two ago, some fella named Wyndelius came through; said he was some kind of a treasure hunter.
I warned him not to go in there, just like I warned you. The very next night we heard screams from the barrow, and that was it.
We shall soon find out.
Is that so? You should be. Though a heart without fear is something I can use... Perhaps you are the one I seek.
Well enough, I suppose.
Elenwen puts a great deal of effort into these parties, and it shows.
I just wonder what her real motivations are. That woman is inscrutable.
Well met again, Hunter.
Well, explain yourself!
So, what is it? What have you done?
Did you know what we were attempting? Are you here to make sure your plan worked, that our efforts have been for nothing?
Where else would we be?
Windhelm is the first city on that road, and here we are.
If we had known the Nords would be so unwelcoming, we may have kept walking.
When the Red Mountain burned, you could scarcely breathe in Morrowind. So we came west.
Why are you still here?
I've never seen you before. Leave me alone!
You don't look so tough. I'll bet I could take you.
Wouldn't even be here if it weren't for my idiot sister.
All this talk of dragons is making people antsy. Nonsense!
An outsider? No reason to stop in Kynesgrove. Keep moving.
Oh, great, another wanderer. Slumming it on your way to Windhelm?
I hope you'll stay for a bit. We could certainly use the business.
My wife is a good woman, but every man needs a little variety, you know?
I visited the meaderies of Riften once, as a lad. Wish I had their skill.
Seen the remnants of the grove? That... well, that was me. Me and my sister.
Kjeld speaks for Kynesgrove. Anyone who says otherwise is aching for a fight.
If you bring mead, you're welcome here! Even if you don't, you're still welcome!
My pa runs this town, and you're going to be in big trouble if you mess with me.
The mine's always on the verge of collapse. Good thing I'm around to keep it up.
This is really quite a nice town when you get down to it. Just look at the view!
Did you see my husband already? I'm sorry... he can come off a bit rough at times.
Welcome to Kynesgrove. If you want to do business here, you'll have to deal with me.
Came here to start a lumber mill. Who knew the Nords cared about a bunch of old trees?
Morrowind used to be a lovely place, but you couldn't pay me to live there these days.
Got some nice comfy beds at the Braidwood Inn, if you're looking to flop down somewhere.
I should get over to Windhelm more. See how the other Morrowind refugees are getting along.
You've got a fine look about you. Come have a visit at the Braidwood Inn. Better than home!
Most people in Skyrim don't care for Dunmer. Roggi's the only one around here even half-decent.
Roggi and I do the work around here. My wife and brats just sit around on their brains wasting time.
If these Nords don't let up soon, I might just make a break for it. At least Cyrodiil is warmer than this.
I can't believe she dragged me all the way to this snowball. I'd rather be broke in Cyrodiil than broke here.
Working our mine is dangerous work, but Dravynea keeps it going. Well, Dravynea and the promise of more mead.
But... well, they did. Sacred, they said. So we work the mines until we've worked it off. Fair enough, I guess.
If it's malachite you're after, you've come to the right place. I'll pay for any you dig up out of Steamscorch Mine.
Yeah, that was a shame.
But now Alva takes care of me. And I take care of her.
Yes mother? What is it?
Harrald, I have need of you.
Well, make sure we keep the patrols out night and day, just to be certain.
This situation with the sewers beneath the city. I hear people have entered this place and have gone missing. Do you know of this?
Yes, I've heard such things. Anuriel assures me they're just fabrications and there's nothing down there save a few stray skeever.
Yes, champion of Azura?
Until next time, guardian.
What do you need, guardian?
It's been an honor, guardian.
The Twilight watches us all, guardian.
I don't like doing business with Azura's faithful. Make it quick.
Just glad all that business with Malyn is over with. What did you need?
You are troubled, Gorm.
Yes, okay. Well thank you.
No, Gorm. I am simply telling you what I see.
No, no. I'm fine. Is there something you need?
You fight well, sister.
You fight well, brother.
You should. I miss you.
Not when there's so much to see!
I guess I should join you more often.
Ever think about spending more time around town?
You... you did? He has?
Here, here. For your troubles! Shiny, clinky gold! A few coins for a kind deed! And thank you! Thank you again.
Oh stranger! You have made Cicero so happy! So jubilant and ecstatic! But more! Even more! My mother thanks you!
You've decided to help?
A cave. Dark. Dangerous.
Oh, look. A Nordic ruin.
Old ruins. Nordic, I think.
A cave. Up for some hunting?
Is that one of the old ruins?
Nordic ruins. Old. Secretive.
Hmm. Caves. Wonder what's below.
There's a cave. Tread carefully.
Huh. Dwarven ruins. Strange places.
Another filthy cave. Always so dark.
Seems like a ruin. Dwarven, I think?
Old stonework. Gold, traps, and bones.
Hey look, a cave. Wonder what's inside?
Look over there. That's a dwarven ruin.
Nord stonework. Thousands of years old.
Cave up ahead. Trouble or maybe treasure?
Dwarven metalwork. So much wasted effort.
My word, look at those ruins. Remarkable.
It's a Nordic ruin. Thousands of years old.
Look, a cave. A fine place to find trouble.
The old Nords sure did love their stonework.
A dwarven city. A place of mystery and death.
A Dwemer city. The lost people. The heretics.
Ruins ahead. Means old traps and bonewalkers.
Look at those ruins. Think there's gold inside?
Look. Nordic ruins. I hope there's gold inside.
Hey, there's a cave. Bad place to stumble drunk.
There's a cave here. Think we should check it out?
There's a cave. Animals or bandits inside, no doubt.
Old dwarven ruin. Look at that metalwork. Such a waste.
Look at that, a cave. Who knows what could be down there?
Look at those old stones. Ancient Nords sure could build.
There's a cave here. Perfect hideout for bandits or worse.
Dwemer ruins. The people under the mountains. All gone now.
Look at those ruins. How long have they stood here, I wonder?
There's a cave here. Bears if we're lucky. Trolls if we're not.
Look at these stones. The ancestors knew how to build, no doubt.
Look. One of the ancient Nord ruins. Who knows what's down there?
Oh, look. It's the entrance to a dwarven city. I've heard stories....
That's a dwarven city. I hear they built armor that walks like people.
Look, a cave. An exciting place to venture, if you know what you're doing.
Get nervous around dwarven stonework. Legends say these cities are haunted.
I dislike lurking near dwarven cities. It's like their ghosts are watching us.
Is that a dwarven city? I've never seen a dwarf, ever. Don't think anyone has.
By the Mane, look. A dwarven city. Still sitting here after thousands of years.
We've found a cave. I don't think there are warm fires and friendly faces inside.
Is this that dwarven city? I hear the treasure from their ruins is worth a fortune.
The entrance to a dwarven city. All manner of strange traps and machines will be inside.
And if he still refuses?
Give him one more week to think about it.
Then put the thumbscrews on him and hit him... hard.
Bersi still refuses to cooperate. What did you want to do?
I've known Bersi a long time. Even before he opened that rubbish heap he calls a shop.
And the Whispering Lady.
Places where you can overhear things. See things.
This castle is old. Lots of places nobody's been in a long while.
Are you all right, dear?
The house is so... empty, Enmon... and quiet.
Arn? Never heard of him.
I guess that means you're finished. Here's your payment.
Tell Delvin that he has my support and all the weight it carries in Whiterun from now on. I think he'll be quite pleased.
Carrots? Really? Okay...
Death comes for you now!
Mortal fool! No one hides from the dead!
Do they? How delightful!
It's bad luck to talk about that place.
Hroggar's house? It burned down not too long ago.
I'm lucky to have a man that is so devoted to me.
The townsfolk won't go near it. Superstitious lot.
Most folk won't go near it now for fear it's cursed.
Hroggar's house? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
My people believe it to be cursed now. Who am I to gainsay them?
Hroggar's house fire? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
Hroggar's house fire? Aye. He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
It's a real pity about his wife and kid. The screams woke half the town.
Jarl's been looking for someone who ain't superstitious though. Be lookin' for a fool if you ask me.
Don't blame you one bit.
Excellent. I can't wait.
Well... why are you still standing here? Oh, right. You need to know where they are! That would help.
Fine. Let's trade, then.
Sure, what have you got?
If that is what you wish.
What do you need to take?
Need me to carry something?
No problem! How can I help?
What do you want me to carry?
I am sworn to carry your burdens.
Do I get to keep it? Just kidding.
I'll shoulder some of your burden.
If it will help you, then certainly.
I'm a mage, not a pawnbroker, you know.
No problem, I can carry a good bit of gear.
J'zargo only has so much room to carry things.
Running out of room, eh? I'll be glad to help.
Sure, feel free to hand me all the gold you want.
I am an apprentice wizard, not a pack mule! Oh very well, but make it quick.
Give me a reason to try.
You always were a quick study.
Enough of this mindless banter!
It was the first lesson Gallus taught us.
Farewell. I'll be certain to give Brynjolf your regards.
Not quick enough, otherwise Gallus would still be alive.
Come, Karliah. It's time for you and Gallus to become reunited!
But I can promise the next time we meet, it will be your undoing.
How interesting. It appears Gallus's history has repeated itself.
I'm no fool, Mercer. Crossing blades with you would be a death sentence.
Gallus had his wealth and he had you. All he had to do was look the other way.
[QUOTE]To ensure an enemy's defeat, you must first undermine his allies.[QUOTE]
Do you honestly think your arrow will reach me before my blade finds your heart?
But do you know what intrigues me the most? The fact that this was all possible because of you.
Did you forget the Oath we took as Nightingales? Did you expect him to simply ignore your methods?
You're a clever girl, Karliah. Buying Goldenglow Estate and funding Honningbrew Meadery was inspired.
Karliah has provided me with the means to be rid of you, and this ancient tomb becomes your final resting place.
Have you lost your mind?
Please, you must set this right. I'm begging you.
Think, please, just for a moment, about what he would do if he knew its true value.
Do you really believe he would honor our agreement, or go running off to the highest bidder?
Here's for your trouble.
Either way, this is the end of it.
Figures -- I doubt you have sufficient knowledge to harm the Phial even if you wanted to.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm not quite in the mood to entertain guests. I trust you can show yourself out.
Here's what I can spare.
How are the little ones?
Well, that's the good and the bad of it.
He takes after his father, and she takes after you.
Oh, you know. Little Kjeld is a handful, and Froa is just so quiet.
I can hardly believe it.
I'll do what I can here. Go now, go!
But there's no time. Whatever happened here has affected Winterhold as well. I need you to get out there and make sure everything's all right.
I must protest, my Jarl.
But when this war is won, I will have my parade!
Oh, very well. I can see there's no changing your stubborn Nord minds.
What a... fine idea, my Jarl. However, I would suggest we wait until the war has ended.
A parade would make you an easy target for a Stormcloak assassin. You're safer here in the palace.
Steward, I have an idea that might help to bolster the morale of our people in this difficult time.
After all, the General needs his soldiers out in the field, fighting battles against the Stormcloaks.
I think we shall have a grand parade, and let General Tullius march his troops from the Blue Palace to Castle Dour in all their finery.
I used to think so, too.
I... shouldn't say that.
Cure? Hah. You're sounding like the old man.
I love Kodlak. I respect and follow him. But he's wrong on this. It's no curse. We're made into the greatest hunters in the land.
If he's worried about some mead-swilling afterlife in Sovngarde, he's free to pursue it. I'll take the glories of the hunt right here.
I'll read it. Thank you.
Are you out of your mind?
What's this nonsense? Bah.
Mara can't help me. No one can.
I have no desire to seek religion.
I don't have time for this nonsense.
I'll give it a try, thanks very much.
Had only Mara saved that poor animal...
Interesting. I'll look it over. Thanks.
I hold my own beliefs, but thanks anyway.
Oh, interesting. I'll read it this evening.
Seems like a noble cause, I'll look it over.
Thank you. Blessings of Mara upon you as well.
Not really my usual read, but I'll give it a try.
Oh, well thank you. I'll try and read this if I can.
I think I have some more of these padding my mattress.
Thank you for the blessing, I'll put this to good use.
Do you take me for a fool? Get this drivel away from me!
If only more people would read this, things might be better in Riften.
I don't understand how paper will help the dregs of this city, but suit yourself.
I have no time for Marla or Mara or whatever her name is... there's work to be done!
I visit the temple sometimes, but perhaps not often enough. Thanks for bringing this to me.
Mara this and Mara that. Where is she when hundreds of Stormcloaks are dying for no good reason, eh?
I'm starting to think...
If that makes any sense.
You know what I mean. Forges have personalities, right?
If the Nine are willing!
I won't forget. I'll do it after I get the dishes cleaned.
You've been working hard lately. You'll make a fine innkeeper someday.
Mind you don't forget to sweep up, Julienne. The floor's looking a bit dusty.
If you win, you go free.
If you lose, well, you'll know the freedom of Sovngarde if you're lucky.
We don't just let people rot in cells until they've served their time. Here, you fight.
In a manner of speaking.
I'm afraid it's going to be a while before I can get any more Goldenglow Honey.
May I ask what all the honey's for? I mean, you used to buy almost a jar a week. Are you cooking or something?
I thought it was strange that Aringoth stopped coming into town. I suppose he's having some difficulties out there.
INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK
Is someone following me?
It is time for us to go.
It would be my pleasure.
It's been easier lately.
I have my ways, but it's not easy these days.
The Blackblood Marauders haven't been seen since the Icerunner attack, so my shipments have been more regular.
The Blackblood Marauders have been plundering ships off the coast. A lot of people been hurt by their foolishness.
Just stay out of my way.
Let him guide your path.
The Jarl trusts few, and they will be his undoing. The dark child knows of what I speak.
The whole of Whiterun is ripe with paranoia and tensions. The Jarl's court is right to fear the power I hold behind this door.
Let's make the exchange.
I see you but I don't see Frost. Come back when you have the horse with you.
Ha! You've done it! Got to admit, I wasn't sure you could pull it off. But you've definitely earned your pay.
Light, medium, or heavy?
Yep. I have just one question for you.
Loose ends and all that.
Oh, and when you're done with Virane, kill him.
Next, you'll have to... Are you still paying attention?
I believe so. Therefore, you are to obtain that information from Virane - who the Gourmet really is, and where he can be found.
Mama, where did papa go?
Yes. I'm sure he's doing well there.
Last time you said he was fighting for the Empire.
He's off fighting the war, dear. For the Stormcloaks.
Maybe this is a way out?
You've got to help me! Please!
Maybe one of the guards had a key?
There's got to be some way out of here!
What did you tell him? Why did you do this to me?
I don't know where I'll go. Somewhere far away from here.
Me? Ha! Are you serious?
What? Oh gods, I don't want to die...
Excuse me? What kind of question is that?
More tea, Pelly my dear?
Who among you can help me?
Please, take pity on an old madman!
Luggage! Now where did I leave my luggage?
Yes, yes, as you've said, countless times before...
Is it just me or is it getting saner and saner these days?
I found the bone! I've brought it to you but still I am refused...
How rude! Can't be bothered to host an old friend for a decade or two.
Yes, yes, go. Leave me to my ceaseless responsibilities and burdens...
A method to your madness and your madness is the method and the melody...
I see you've been minding your own business. So how is the mind business?
Yes, yes, that's quite enough celebration. Let's send you ahead, shall we?
Do you mind? I'm busy doing the fishstick. It's a very delicate state of mind!
Oh, I couldn't. Goes right through me. Besides, I have so many things to do...
Why does everyone ignore me? Why do you turn your heads? Why will no one help me?
Let's make sure I'm not forgetting anything. Clothes? Check. Beard? Check! Luggage?
Wait, hear my plea! My master, he is lost between worlds and I cannot bring him back!
I have a saying - I'm not going to feel what you have to like. Or something like that.
Pelagius stopped by and mentioned he hated you. Or I mentioned he hated you and he agreed.
Master! You've taken me back! Does this mean we're going home? Oh, happy times! I can't wait to...
The flame of my master burns low. Without him, we are all lost and forever gray... Please, help us!
Oh, master. It's your time to do with as you please, but what about those who depend on you so much?
I hope you're having a good time. Actually, I hope I'm having a good time. I could care less about you.
Tendrils of thought may wind their way through this realm, but those tendrils bind our reality together.
Pelagius Septim the Third, once the Mad Emperor of Tamriel, now so boringly sane. I always knew he had it in him!
So many undesirables to contend with. Naysayers. Buffoons. Detractors. Why, my headsman hasn't slept in three days!
Well, I suppose it's back to the Shivering Isles. The trouble Haskill can get into while I'm gone simply boggles the mind...
And as for you, my little mortal minion... Feel free to keep the Wabbajack. As a symbol of my... Oh, just take the damn thing.
Hafrumph! Well then, if you're going to be like that... Perhaps it's best I take my leave. A good day to you sir. I said good day!
You take care of yourself, now. And if you ever find yourself in New Sheoth, do look me up. We can share a strawberry torte. Ta ta!
You are the best Septim that's ever ruled. Well, except for that Martin fellow, but he turned into a dragon god, and that's hardly sporting...
You know, I was there for that whole sordid affair. Marvelous time! Butterflies, blood, a Fox, a severed head... Oh, and the cheese! To die for.
You are far too hard on yourself, my dear, sweet, homicidally insane Pelagius. What would the people do without you? Dance? Sing? Smile? Grow old?
My soul is now prepared.
Let's go to the Tomb. We can do the cleansing there.
You still have one of the witch's heads. This is good.
And that you knew where to get more. Let's go find one!
A strange kind of ritual, but I won't mind killing those wretched things.
Aela said that the cleansing used a head from one of the witches of Glenmoril, yes?
You still bear a head of the Glenmoril betrayers, yes? Then lead on, back to the Tomb of Ysgramor.
Aela said we would need a Hagraven's head. I already have one of them, but she said it was a special kind.
No! Don't hurt me again!
You gonna hurt me again?
Please! Don't hurt me again!
I don't want to be hurt again!
You! Don't hurt me! Not again!
I don't want to fight you again.
Ah! No more! Don't hurt me again.
Hey! You're the one that hurt me!
Stay away! Last time you hurt me.
Hey! Don't get mad and hurt me again.
You! Back to inflict more pain on me?
You're the brute that hurt me before.
Attack me again and I'll hunt you down!
Ah! Are you planning on hurting me again?
If it's a fight you want, I'm ready this time.
Uh, oh. You ain't gonna hurt me again, are ya?
I hope you're not planning to attack me again...
You wouldn't attack an old man again, would you?
You wouldn't attack an old woman again, would you?
Don't come near me! I don't want to get hurt again.
You here to attack me? I'm ready for you this time.
If you try to hurt me again, I may have to kill you.
Look, I don't want to get in another brawl with you.
Come back to gloat? I've been beaten by worse than you.
If you provoke me, I will be forced to unsheathe my claws.
Well, if it isn't the bully that goes around hurting people.
I don't go down easy if you raise your hand against me again.
This one's claws are ready for you should you assault me again.
I don't want any trouble. Not after what you did to me last time.
You have a lot of nerve coming near me again. I'm still sore from what you did to me.
Normally, a quick death.
Normally, a period of servitude.
Now get out of my house!
You already got what you wanted, you damn hound. This is your fault.
You and Madanach are animals, and I'll see you both rot to death in Cidhna Mine for this.
Now, I need to be alone.
So that's it, then. [QUOTE]Don't come back.[QUOTE]
Thank you. Here. You honored my mother's task and should be rewarded.
Now, on to other things.
I suppose it's not a total loss then.
Here you go, I think you'll find these quite useful.
Well done. And it would seem I owe you something in return.
Let me give you a piece of advice. If you want to make some serious coin in this business you need to listen to rules.
Oh, how kind! Thank you.
Thank you. I'll share this with Aerin.
Thank you. Umm, blessings upon you too.
Whatever you're peddling, I'm not buying.
Are you serious? You're as crazy as Maramal.
I wouldn't even clean my tail with this trash.
Ugh. Get this awful paper away from me, by Talos!
Excellent, I needed some more kindling for my kitchen hearth.
Huh? Oh. Sure, whatever. I prefer Dibella's teachings myself.
Oh, a new pamphlet from Dinya? I'll be glad to read it. Thanks.
Mara only helps those who can afford her tithes. This is nonsense.
Look, the only religion I believe in is the good old septim. Everything else is just a waste.
Hmmm. Never read anything from the temple before. I suppose there wouldn't be any harm in reading it.
Unless Mara wishes to come down and help me with these urchins, I don't really give a damn about her blessings.
Oh! Bolli... yes, hello.
Sigh. Yes, as usual. I'll be there.
Nivenor, my darling. What a pleasant surprise.
Will we be dining together this evening after my work at the fishery?
Oh. Is that all? Really?
Come now! You're joking with old Nazir! Surely the Emperor's life was worth more than that.
Perhaps some other time.
Praise to you, champion!
You've brought us quite the meal.
It's an honor, Keeper of the Ring.
Now this is going to be a good feast.
I remember my first feast. I envy you.
I'm so glad Eola invited you to dinner.
You were given Namira's ring? A great honor.
Ah, the new disciple. I hear you have quite the appetite.
Namira spoke to you? I knew this feast was going to be something.
She's a girl. She cried.
That is rich. What did she do?
It's good to toughen her up. Not an easy world out here. Keep at it.
And then I told her about the vampires and how much they would pay me for her.
Skooma addict. Get lost.
Getting the shakes, huh? All right. Take it. Old gods keep you.
So, you're here to help?
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Are you working with the Battle-Borns? Speak now before I put you in the ground!
Sounds good. Be careful.
Stay your hand, warrior!
My men will not attack you, if you will lower your weapons.
I think we can all profit from the situation in which we find ourselves.
It's no secret why you're here and you have proven your skill in combat. Let us talk a moment, and no one else needs to die.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you, land-strider.
Thank you, marsh-friend.
Thank you. I'll be here.
Thank you. Please hurry!
That remains to be seen.
That would be wonderful.
I'll be sure and have everything ready. This is exciting, isn't it?
That's all I know, okay?
Fine. Whatever you want. Can't you just kill me and get it over with?
There's this old man. I've seen him around Riften. I don't know where he lives. I don't know his name.
Yes, he matches the description of this Esbern guy you're looking for. Maybe it's him. Maybe it isn't.
That's it! You found it!
That's kind of you, Lod.
How's the Corpselight treating you Mathies?
You know how farming is here, long days and little to show for it.
Mathies. I wanted to say I'm sorry about what happened to your girl.
That's the wrong answer.
Last thing the Black-Briars need around here is some troublemaker tryin' to steal a piece of the action.
This is a little creepy.
That doesn't begin to describe it.
You seem uncomfortable being here.
I just don't know that it's right for us to be in here like this, picking through the ruins .
Ugh. It's talking to me.
Clearly you have no idea who I am you or you wouldn't dare approach me.
I hate this place. I hate the trees. I hate the rocks. And I hate the snow.
Vampire dust? Seriously?
All right. What next, then?
Hmm... yes. I guess I can see how that would add a more... earthy texture. And, oddly enough, we do have some on hand...
Was there anything else?
Trying to make Mercer look bad in front of Maven, eh? Clever lass.
Watch it, there, sister.
Watch it, there, brother.
All right, you want to go?
Watch what you're doing.
Welcome to Shor's Stone.
I trust my parents are well?
Sorry, the mine's dry right now.
Nasty little buggers, aren't they?
What brings you out to Shor's Stone?
The spiders put you through the ringer?
You're looking at the best miner in Skyrim.
Ha! You showed those spiders a thing or two!
Came all the way out here to see us, did you?
The mine will be running better than ever thanks to you.
Would you happen to be headed towards Darkwater Crossing?
I hate seeing a good mine go to waste like that, you know?
I'd wager I could crack rock faster than anyone. Even you.
Mining's my life now, I wouldn't want to do anything else.
I hope you haven't arrived here looking for work in the mine.
If you're looking for supplies, I'd advise heading to Riften.
Takes a lot of strength to swing a pick axe, know what I mean?
Aye, I see the look you're giving me. Don't worry, I won't bite.
I suppose you're used to traveling, being a stranger around here.
Making that trip to Darkwater Crossing was a huge help. Thank you.
Everything was going great in Redbelly. Then the damn spiders showed up.
Have you ever been to Darkwater Crossing? Terrible name for such a beautiful place.
Sure, I used to be a soldier... but that was child's play compared to cracking rock.
You think you're tough, huh? Wandering Skyrim is a picnic compared to tunnel crawling!
The real work happens in places like this. Blood and sweat is what makes the world turn.
What are you lookin' at?
We won't give you any more trouble.
Don't worry, Hewnon will let you pass.
Sorry to have bothered you. I'll just be out of your way now.
What can I getcha, Alva?
Why, good evening Jonna!
What can't you get me, sweetie?
Umm... Did you want somethin' to eat?
Right. Okay, tell me if you change yer mind.
Eat? No, I don't think I'm... hungry. Not now, at least.
Where did you find this?
Crimson Nirnroot? I'd heard such a strain existed, but never imagined I'd see any in my lifetime.
Which one is that again?
It's the root that looks like an ugly little man.
Vivienne, could you check out supplies of mandrake root?
In that case, I'm pretty sure it tried to buy me a drink last night.
Yes, but... not so loud!
There's a... A problem, yes.
Will you take it to Captain Aldis?
I'm worried about Idgrod, and I don't know what to do.
Yes, fellow Nightingale?
Yes, my friend? How may I help?
Yes, I suppose there is.
There is a letter, one I have had for some time now. I think it is time it gets delivered.
I cannot leave Idgrod's side, so I must stay here. Could you see that it reaches Captain Aldis in Solitude?
Yes!  The path is clear!
At last, the treasure is mine! All mine!
Cowards, every one of them. Running at the first sign of trouble...
Riches and fortune, within my grasp, and I have to give it all up because they're afraid of a few dead bodies...
You have yourself a bet.
You think so, huh? Maybe you'd like to put some septims behind that boast.
I'd rather spend more time in the mine hauling up iron then doing woman's work keeping the house clean.
I'll have you know I can haul up just as much iron as you in a day and still manage to clean up my messes.
All I'm asking is that you clean up once in a while. How you can find anything in your half of the place is beyond me.
You're right. It's mine.
I thank you. And may Kynareth's soft rains fall before you.
I may not live to see this little one grow into a new Gildergreen, but I can be remembered as the woman who planted it.
Your invitation, please.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm on duty.
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm on duty.
Please proceed into the Embassy.
The Thalmor Embassy welcomes you.
We're not supposed to talk to the guests.
Go right on in. The party has already started.
Guests are advised to remain inside the Embassy.
Welcome to the Thalmor Embassy. Your invitation, please.
You must present your invitation to be admitted to the party.
[QUOTE]I survived[QUOTE]?
What? Your heroic tale of locking yourself in the Ratway for years isn't enough?
I've been chronicling the recent history of the Blades. What would you like your entry to say?
Come now. You did more than just survive all those years. Your evasion of the Thalmor would be useful for future Blades to study.
A dragon! I saw a dragon!
What? What is it now, mother?
And I've got better things to do than listen to more of your fantasies.
You'll see! It was a dragon! It'll kill us all and then you'll believe me!
It was as big as the mountain, and black as night. It flew right over the barrow.
Dragons, now, is it? Please, mother. If you keep on like this everyone in town will think you're crazy.
A problem? Let me see it.
He's written all of the text in the Falmer language.
This is just like Gallus. A dear friend, but always too clever for his own good.
About time you showed up.
Can't a man drink in peace?
I can't believe that worked.
I trust you have good news for me.
I can't wait to see Sabjorn squirm.
Was something we discussed unclear?
You're supposed to be at the meadery.
Why aren't you at Honningbrew Meadery?
Shouldn't you be on your way to Whiterun?
Out with it. What happened at the meadery?
What is it now? We have a tasting to attend to!
You did this didn't you? I'll get you for this!
I believe Brynjolf wishes to speak with you. We're done here.
I haven't heard even a scratch at the door. Have you done it?
Maven wants to see you right away. I suggest you head right over.
I'm certain Maven wishes you to be in Whiterun, not wasting time here.
Ah! Well done! Well done!
Here's your payment. Well earned, indeed.
Those caravaners can be an elusive bunch. Takes a fair bit of stalking to take one down. But then, that's half the fun, isn't it?
And how do you know this?
And now winter is coming.
The fields will need cutting soon.
I suppose so. Seems like it was just turning summer yesterday.
Anything you say, Mother.
Hemming, I want you to personally supervise the next shipment.
We already have people that do that and they make quite a bit of coin for it.
I don't trust them. Come to think of it, I don't trust you either, but at least you're family.
But tomorrow. Definitely.
I want to see you when you're done working.
Don't say that out loud. Not here. And the answer's still no.
Don't talk about my father like that, Jon. And the answer's still no.
That's your imagination running wild. Nobody knows how we feel about each other.
I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my family is starting to suspect something.
I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my father is starting to suspect something.
But we had been deceived.
They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else.
But whales eat razorfish.
You only use the little swords.
And they always come to regret it.
It's called a shortsword, oaf. It's quicker. Sharper. Like a razorfish against a whale.
Calcelmo? What about him?
Changed your mind I hope?
What wasn't I clear about?
Okay lad, ready to make some coin?
Okay lass, ready to make some coin?
When I'm done here, I'd be more than happy to sell you an elixir.
Please, please... hold all your questions until after I've finished!
Oh, excuse me, milady. I'll be glad to sell you an elixir after I'm done with these fine people.
Oh, excuse me, milord. I'll be glad to sell you an elixir after I'm done with these fine people.
Clavicus gave him an axe.
The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter's curse.
One of Clavicus's little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshiped Hircine.
When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn't stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form.
Do they know where he is?
Ironic, right? The old enemies assume that every calamity must be a plot by the other side...
Even so, we've got to find Esbern before they do. He'll know how to stop the dragons if anybody does.
Don't stop. Keep cutting.
So this is your plan, Lucan?
Mara bless you for agreeing to help us.
Don't let my sister do anything foolish.
Yes. So now you don't have to go, do you?
So, you need a guide out of town after all?
Damn thieves. As if things weren't bad enough.
Thanks. I only wish Camilla was here to see it.
I should lock up the store now. Thank you again.
Show those thieves not to steal from Lucan Valerius!
You're back from Bleak Falls. Did you find anything?
I better get back to cleaning the store. What a mess.
Thanks. I only wish Lucan was here to see this again.
I guess Lucan will never see the golden claw again now.
Mara, I forgot how late it was. Need to lock up the shop.
Bleak Falls Barrow is just outside of town. I can show you.
Maybe you could talk some sense into my pig-headed brother.
Oh really? Well I think your new helper here needs a guide.
If you're going after the claw, you'll need to know the way.
Take this. You've done a good thing for the Riverwood Trader.
You have the claw. Oh, you have to tell Lucan at once. Hurry!
Hurry up and tell Lucan you have the claw. He'll be so excited!
Mara, I forgot how late it was. We'll need to lock up the shop.
Good luck. Lucan and I will be waiting for you back in the shop.
Lucan's dead. I guess I'm in charge of the Riverwood Trader now.
Here, take this. You've done a good thing for the Riverwood Trader.
Wh- no... I.... Oh, by the Eight, fine. But only to the edge of town!
You can see it from here, though. The mountain just over the buildings.
I'll need to lock up the store. Thank you so much for agreeing to help us.
The sooner you find the claw, the sooner our lives can get back to normal.
Thanks. I guess this was the least you could do after what happened to Lucan.
We have to go through town and across the bridge to get to Bleak Falls Barrow.
Thanks. I guess this was the least you could do after what happened to Camilla.
Did you hear? The Riverwood Trader was robbed! Poor Lucan must be torn to pieces over it.
I don't know what you overheard, but the Riverwood Trader is still open. Feel free to shop.
I guess I should get back to my brother. He'll throw a fit if I take too long. Such a child....
I heard Lucan yelling the other day about a thief breaking into his store. It wasn't me, honest!
You found it? Ha ha ha. There it is. Strange... it seems smaller than I remember. Funny thing, huh?
Now, if you're going to get those thieves, you should head to Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town.
This is the bridge out of town. The path up the mountain to the northwest leads to Bleak Falls Barrow.
Lucan over in the Riverwood Trader says thieves broke into his store. Strange, he says they hardly took anything.
I'm going to put this back where it belongs. I'll never forget this. You've done a great thing for me and my sister.
Lucan found the claw about a year after he opened the store. He never quite explained where he got it. He's a tricky one.
I wonder why they only stole Lucan's golden claw. I mean, we have plenty of things in the shop that are worth just as much coin.
Those thieves must be mad, hiding out there. Those old crypts are filled with nothing but traps, trolls, and who knows what else!
Eternal slumber awaits...
My thirst will be sated...
Oh, I can smell your blood...
Come. Come and face the Forsworn...
First you... then all of the Reach!
Can't wait to count out your coin...
Ohh... but I will have your blood...
The endless sleep comes for us all...
Foolish human. Your time is at its end!
Soon you will know the cold of death...
Behold, the future. Behold, the Thalmor!
Time for you humans to learn your place!
You are but a dog, and I am your master!
Death is the only way out of your misery!
Don't you see? I am master of the arcane!
Soon, all Nords will be thralls to the Thalmor!
You cannot even conceive of the power I wield...
Don't you see? Elven supremacy is the only truth!
Ha ha ha ha ha! You wish to defeat me? Impossible.
The Forsworn will reclaim what is rightfully ours!
You'll be so much easier to rob when you're dead...
Nord beast! Both your life and lands are now forfeit!
Fire, frost, or lightning - you will suffer at my hands!
Tell you what. You start running so I can stab you in the back.
Even its name is an echo.
Our tree here in the city was grown from a cutting of that tree. You can still feel the glory of the mother tree through it.
To the east of here is a hidden grove where the Eldergleam resides. It's the oldest living thing in Skyrim. Maybe all of Tamriel.
Gee, thanks for the help.
Oh, we have unfinished business you and I.
Good hunting. I'll see you back at the Sanctuary.
And now we come to the end of our play. The grand finale.
Ha ha! Behold the final trick of the Fool of Hearts! You think me near death? Think again!
Oh, but this isn't at all what Mother would want. You kill the Keeper or I kill the Listener? Now that's madness.
Kill me if you must. But I can't promise I won't haunt you till the end of your days if... if the Dread Lord lets me. Ha ha ha ha ha.
Listener! Is that you? Oh, I knew you'd come. Send the best to defeat the best. Astrid knew her stupid wolf couldn't slay sly Cicero.
Kill me or don't, Listener! The power is yours! But spare poor Cicero, and a friend you will have! Oh, such a friend, until we enter the Void...
If it's any comfort, I do feel slightly bad about Veezara. Stupid lizard got in my way! But please tell me that hulking sheepdog has bled to death.
You're... still alive. Cicero respects the Listener's abilities, of course, but could you at least slow down a bit? I'm not what I used to be. Heh.
Cicero admits, he thought the Listener would be dead by now. Heh. Maybe we could just forget all this? Hmm? Let bygones be bygones? What do you say?
All right, so Cicero attacked that harlot, Astrid! But what's a fool to do, when his mother is slandered and mocked? Surely the Listener understands!
Ouch! Pointy pointy! My home is well defended. I always have been a stickler for details. Get it? [QUOTE]Stick-ler.[QUOTE] Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I slay me!
Brrr! Chilly! You'll enjoy this. Not an original part of the Sanctuary, per se. Let's call it a [QUOTE]forced addition.[QUOTE] Forced by what? Oh, come and see!
Gods above! Look at that!
Steady. Let's see what it does.
Kill the damn dragon! Unless you have a better idea?!
Come on. We need to find out what's happening up there!
Stay under cover. This is what we came for. We need to see what happens.
Gray-Mane or Battle-Born?
Ha! We'll see about that!
Have anything for us yet?
You want something or not?
No! That urn was priceless!
I trust everything went well?
It's you! Please, don't hurt me!
I... I don't care! I'm not paying!
So, can I interest you in anything today?
Now what did you want? I already paid you.
I said get out! I'm not paying a single coin!
All right, I'll entertain you a bit more. Go on.
Look, I got the message. What else did you want?
Oh no! You're the one from Brynjolf's outfit, aren't you?
We got the message... now just take your business elsewhere.
Please, reconsider what you're doing. Maybe I can pay later...
Here for a room or something to drink? Show me some coin first.
What is it with you and all these questions? Very well, ask away.
I know you... everyone's been talking about it. What are you here for?
I'm not paying you or Brynjolf a single coin! Now get out of my tavern!
Please! Don't take the statue! It's the only thing of value I have left!
I hope you're here for friendlier reasons now... after all, I'm all paid up.
If you're looking for a room, try the Bee and Barb. This place is for the working man.
Ask all you want, you can't squeeze blood from a stone. Not in this part of the world anyway.
I'm sorry, you're going to have to leave. Tell Brynjolf he'll just have to make due without my coin.
Have I made myself clear?
You shouldn't leave weapons laying around. Someone could get hurt. And if I see you do it again, that someone will be you.
Have you found something?
Hey, welcome to the mill!
These boys do good work for the Empire!
These axes can chop a lot more than wood, you know.
We don't take kindly to people snooping around our business.
We got everything in hand here. You aren't needed 'round here.
We chop trees, we mill the wood. What more would you want to know?
It's a hard way to make a living, but we find ways to make ends meet.
We're making our money back, bit by bit. Every extra bit of work helps...
We served our time in the Legion. Now we're just trying to make it day to day.
Nice to be here on the home-front. Wouldn't mind being down in Cyrodiil, though.
I used to serve with Trilf and Steirod. Good guys, but don't get on their bad side, you know?
I once saw Steirod tear a whole tree out the ground with his bare hands. Glad he's on our side!
My brother and me bought this place when we left the army. Boy, did we lose a bundle, but at least we're not fighting the war!
Hey! It's the bard-to-be.
How are you feeling, Vex?
Well, I see your wounds have healed but your pride still needs some time.
Pretty angry actually. I can't believe I botched the Goldenglow job. That should have been like stealing a sweetroll from a baby.
Brynjolf, something stinks around here and it's more than just the Ratway. We all know it. The question is, what's Mercer going to do about it?
How's about a drink, Hod.
You'll be wantin' me to pay for them?
It's only right seein' as your the important lumber man.
You come do an honest day's work at my mill, and I'll pay you an honest day's wages. Then we'll drink.
I do miss that helmet....
If you find that ring, bring it here.
That journal means a lot to me, if you find it.
Hopefully, that story about Lenne's Shield is true.
Don't forget. You find Queen Freydis's Sword, I'll reward you.
I get so lonely out here.
It's so nice to have a visitor.
It's tough, just scraping by out here. But I make do.
I'm just a poor old woman, dear. No need to trouble yourself with me.
I never miss a good meal.
Thank you for coming to dinner, Hogni.
I surrender! I surrender!
I... I apologize, master.
Don't waste time apologizing, just find the book!
Did they really record the star positions from Curalmil's tomb? There's no way it's that precise.
Quintus, could you fetch me a copy of The Firmament? I need to compare the old star charts to today's.
Confound it, boy, I know what I'm doing. It will help me determine the season of his burial, which I can cross-reference.
I'll be right behind you!
I'll meet you over there.
It's up to her, isn't it?
Aye, I'll hate it, but I'll do it if I have to.
If that must be, then it will. And why should I be any different? How many the lives already lost. What's one more?
Jarl Balgruuf is waiting.
Well? You going to scout ahead or travel with me?
Where do you think you'll be the most help - scouting ahead or supporting the rest of my men?
You're the one that got out of Helgen, aren't you? I could use anyone who's tangled with a dragon before.
Maybe you'd like a taste?
Oh, but that's where you're wrong, lad. Wealth is my business.
Oh, but that's where you're wrong, lass. Wealth is my business.
My wife. They killed her.
Damn Madanach. Damn his Forsworn backside.
Need some metal hammered?
Oh splendid, another Nord.
Another day, another septim.
The conquering hero returns!
Did Viola send you to bother me?
Maybe you should just move along.
Oh, pardon me. Was I in your way?
Yes? Make it quick, I'm a busy man.
Good honest work staves off the cold.
Huh? What's that now? Leave me alone.
I'll find some way to finish my book.
My time is limited, so speak quickly.
Welcome, sister. Please, enjoy yourself.
Spare a coin? Talos rewards the generous.
Welcome, brother. Please, enjoy yourself.
Spare a coin for a poor old woman, milady?
Spare a coin for a poor old woman, milord?
Another Dark Elf. Just what Windhelm needs.
It's good to spend some time on solid land.
No mother should have to bury her daughter.
Come slumming to the Gray Quarter, have you?
You know about Talos? He founded the Empire!
Terrible shame, what happened to those women.
I really can't thank you enough for your help.
I do the cookin' and cleanin' round the palace.
The way I see it, Ulfric's fighting a holy war.
I couldn't ask for a better teacher than Oengul.
What are you looking at? Scared of strong women?
Whatever you've heard I can do is probably true.
Real Nords like to prove their mettle in the pit.
Haven't seen you here before, egg sister. Welcome!
Name's Nils. I'm the cook up at Candlehearth Hall.
Stand away from me, or I'll crack you like an egg.
You look like someone who appreciates nice things.
Haven't seen you here before, egg brother. Welcome!
I don't care much for the war one way or the other.
I hope someday we'll get to know each other better.
These lazy Argonians better get their tails moving.
Welcome, friend, to Calixto's House of Curiosities!
I'd explain my research, but you'd just be confused.
The Stormcloaks are finding victory across the land.
Ulfric was a true hero of Skyrim. He will be missed.
We Argonians do the work the Nords don't want to do.
I'll never have Master Nurelion's skill with potions.
Now more than ever, the world needs tales of heroism.
They say dragons are coming back. I want to kill one!
Those awful Thalmor can't touch us, thanks to Ulfric.
What I lack in strength, I make up for with tenacity.
Never much cared for Windhelm. The place is depressing.
You hear about the Shatter-shield girl? It's a tragedy.
I can't believe the Empire would turn its back on Talos.
I love my husband, but he can be a bit... dull at times.
I made my fortune as a sea captain, but now I'm retired.
If you're an Imperial spy, better turn around right now.
We might be poor, but is it really any better out there?
Brond's one of the most savage fighters I've ever seen...
Captain Lonely-Gale has been avoiding me, I just know it.
I don't care that we lost, I'm just glad the war is over.
I told you, I've got no patience for fools. Keep walking.
This is the Hall of the Dead. Someday you'll end up here.
Be on the lookout. The Butcher could be around any corner!
Ever tried taking care of children? It can be a nightmare.
I don't haggle. If you want a lower price, look elsewhere.
I like to share my good fortune with those who deserve it.
I try to keep Grimvar safe, but these are dangerous times.
Poor Nilsine has been wrecked since her sister was killed.
Stay away from the Aretino Residence. The place is cursed.
We should get a dragon for the Pit. I'd love to fight one.
You look mighty tasty. Better not stick around for supper.
I'd love get one of those Imperial weasels under my boot...
Sorry, but I'm not looking to hire any more crew right now.
Working in Windhelm is great. I get to see Ulfric up close.
It bothers me that fewer people come to Windhelm these days.
Must you bother me now? I've almost figured out where it is.
My job's simple enough. The dead don't really complain much.
If you're here to join the Stormcloaks, the palace is inside.
There's two kinds of Pit fighters -- good ones and dead ones.
I never expected Ulfric to live up to his legend, but he does.
Pardon the mess. We're really trying to do better around here.
We're the only Temple in Skyrim that can openly worship Talos.
Can you believe the company won't even dock ships here anymore?
Hey, it's our hero! Seen any more of those pirates around here?
Horses. All day long. Do you have any idea how dull horses are?
Someday all of Skyrim will worship Talos openly, as we do here.
If it's bed or board you're after, Candlehearth Hall's got both.
Know any tales of nobility and courage? I'm keen to record them.
Things have been a lot worse around here since Ulfric took over.
Ugh. I'll need to bathe thoroughly to get this stench off of me.
If you need an apothecary, the White Phial has respectable stock.
The Gray Quarter's a disgrace. Them dark elves live like animals.
We can't thank you enough for helping us get this office running.
You seem like such a nice person. I'd love to hear more about you.
All my goods are legitimate, which is more than I can say for some.
Hermir's become a decent smith. Like to think I had a hand in that.
Talos created the Empire. You'd think they'd show him more respect.
The best way for us to win the Nords' respect is through hard work.
I lost my twin sister a while back. Have you ever lost anyone close?
Ulfric once tried to get me to fight for him, but marching bores me.
Yes, I'm a powerful wizard. No, I won't put on a magic show for you.
You need anything, come see me. I'm as resourceful as I am discreet.
Apparently some Nord women were murdered. Not sure why I should care.
Both my daughters. Now my wife? How much is one man supposed to take?
Don't need to pay me no mind. I'm the least important person in here.
How can Elda hate the dark elves when she knows so little about them?
Those Dark Elf refugees will take over the city if we aren't careful.
To receive the blessing of Talos, you have only to pray at the altar.
Been on the river since I could walk. Wouldn't trade it for the world.
Seeing a good tavern brawl might be just the thing to lift my spirits.
The sooner this war ends, the sooner we can all get on with our lives.
I appreciate everything you've done for us, but I really am quite busy.
I'm not too proud to admit that I need a bit of help from time to time.
I just can't believe that Ulfric is gone. Skyrim will never be free now.
I own Hollyfrost Farm outside the city. It's honest work, if a bit dull.
I wish the Nords, Argonians and dark elves in Windhelm got along better.
I'd travel more, but who wants to deal with all the soldiers these days?
I'm a sailor on the Northwind. We're laying over in Windhelm for awhile.
I've been a lot of things in my life. Pit fighter's the one I'm best at.
I've been fighting in the Pit for years. That should tell you something.
It'll take time to rebuild, but the Nords are no strangers to hard work.
Not really sure what to do with myself anymore. I just miss her so much.
The Gray Quarter's not much to look at now, but it wasn't always so bad.
Women murdered time and again, and all the guards care about is the war.
I still can't believe Isabella's gone. She was such a helpful young lass.
I thought the the Gray Quarter would be a haven for my kind. I was wrong.
If you have any news of the western holds, take it to Ulfric immediately.
Loyal Nords are always welcome here. Anyone else better watch their step.
My master can be a bit short-tempered, but I've learned so much from him.
You don't know what freedom really means until you've lived on the river.
After what happened to those other women, I'm worried about my own safety.
Got some fresh-baked bread an' good cheese, if you're after a bite to eat.
My father says we need to just get on with our lives. Like it's that easy.
Not a day passes that I don't wonder if life would be better in Morrowind.
Only thing I hate worse than those scale-backs are them filthy gray-skins!
The townsfolk call me [QUOTE]captain[QUOTE] because I used to be a sailor.
I see why the Nords like Skyrim. This crisp air is wonderful for the lungs!
I try not to think of her, but sometimes the simplest thing will remind me.
I understand what potions do, but I don't always understand how they do it.
I've been a bit out of sorts since... since our daughter was taken from us.
If the guards would listen to Viola, they'd have caught the Butcher by now.
The milk drinkers in this town wouldn't last five minutes in a real battle.
Alchemy is simple. Unless, of course, you are simple. Then I can't help you.
Can't just throw the big logs on the fire. Got to have the little bits, too.
I like to bring Grimvar down here sometimes. It reminds him how lucky he is.
It's not the cold of Skyrim that gets to me. It's the stink from the people.
When I've made enough money, I'm going to return to Morrowind in high style.
Can't believe Ulfric's gone. If not for Hermir, I'd have left the city by now.
I lost my family years ago. Truth is, I don't really know what keeps me going.
Shahvee knows the dock doesn't look nice, but fresh air is good for the gills.
Torbjorn wants the shipping operations to bring in cash, and I make it happen.
A life on the river makes for weak legs, so I do a lot of walking when we dock.
Did you know that candle on the mantle hasn't gone out in over a hundred years?
Got no time for a Nord who thinks he's better than everyone else. Keep walking.
I have a lot of respect for Ambarys Rendar, but his views are a little extreme.
The docks can be a dangerous place. Don't expect me to save you if you fall in.
The Nords don't appreciate us, but so what? I don't appreciate them right back.
The water is cold, but it's a lot better than having to work up in the dry air.
I'd be out there fighting the Imperials right now if it wasn't for my war-wound.
If Ulfric needs a favor, he has it. Anyone else better pay well for the service.
It's a new day in Windhelm. The Stormcloaks are gone, and so is their prejudice.
Skyrim isn't very friendly for Argonians, so we mostly just keep out of the way.
They call me a war hero. I'm no hero, I'm just a soldier who didn't want to die.
With my swords in their hands, Ulfric's men will send those legion dogs running.
I'm not much of a strategist, but Lord Ulfric listens to my counsel all the same.
Just between you and me, I wouldn't mind if the Empire just up and left for good.
Keepin' the palace clean an' the lords fed ain't easy work, but it's honest work.
Prove your valor in the Pit! If you haven't got any valor, prove your pocketbook!
Trader dropped by recently with some lovely pieces, if you'd like to have a look.
When I'm cutting wood, I pretend there's an Imperial soldier's head on the stump.
Do you know my father? He's really important. He even talks to the Jarl sometimes.
You hear the news? There's a dragon roosting up on Mount Anthor, to the northwest.
I have a decent mind for potions, but I've also learned how to craft magical items.
Can't say I mind the sight of all the Imperial guards. It's a change for the better.
I'm proud of my farm. It takes no small effort to grow crops in this part of Skyrim.
If you're looking to get a drink, Candlehearth Hall's got warm fires and strong ale.
If Ulfric had his way, anyone who wasn't a Nord would be shipped right out of Skyrim.
Looking for shipping? We'll always offer better service than the East Empire Company.
Did you know my father? He was really important. He even talked to the Jarl sometimes.
I hope the wind dies down a bit before tonight. Hard when you've got to sleep outside.
Look, we don't have much love for your kind down here. Probably best if you just left.
Rumor holds that the Aretino boy brought an assassin here. Sounds like nonsense to me.
When Ulfric was killed, justice was done. That might sound harsh, but it's how I feel.
I don't see why we should live as an underclass to the Nords. If anything, they owe us.
If you've got some time, stop by my House of Curiosities. I promise you'll see wonders!
Serving as Steward to Ulfric Stormcloak was a great honor, but I don't miss his temper.
Being a Jarl isn't something I ever wanted, but if I can help these people, then I will.
I'm a lot happier out here on the deck than I am wandering around in that ruin of a city.
Can't wait until we raise anchor. Anytime the boat's not moving, I start to get impatient.
Come see me in the marketplace tomorrow. You won't find better prices in all of Eastmarch.
Don't get too many folks up here these days. Sometimes I think they've forgotten about me.
I've spent my life serving Talos. I don't plan to stop now, no matter what the Empire says.
Mind you don't get fresh with Susanna. She plays the flirt, but it's just to get good tips.
My sister and I once traveled the world to assemble our collection. Such adventures we had!
Nervous being alone at night. Especially these days, with the Butcher prowling the streets.
There's no glory in war. It's just something they tell soldiers so they'll risk their lives.
All the Argonians at the docks are nice to me. Good thing, too, or father would run them off!
Every night, I walk around the Gray Quarter and let them gray-skins know what I think of 'em.
I was one of the best soldiers in the Stormcloak army, until I took a sword through the chest.
If I make enough money from the farm, I'll buy myself a longship to sail the rivers of Skyrim.
The cornerclub's been filling up at night lately. I'll bet Elda up at Candlehearth is jealous.
The Eye of Talos was a fine ship, once. Now it lies wrecked, off an island just north of here.
The Stormcloaks are gone, but Talos will never be forgotten. I don't care what the Thalmor say!
You should unload some of that unwanted gear. Head over to Sadri's Used Wares, talk to the Elf.
You didn't hear it from me, but if you want a real drink, try the Cornerclub in the Gray Quarter.
I heard those Forsworn out west live in caves. Can't be any worse than trying to live in Windhelm.
Captain Kjar expects the best, but he's a fair man. He never fails to reward hard work and loyalty.
This is Stormcloak territory. If you're one of those craven Imperials, don't expect a warm welcome.
Too many dark elves in Windhelm complain about the way we're treated. What good does complaining do?
With Ulfric dead and the Stormcloaks gone, who will have the courage to champion the cause of Talos?
Everyone says Eorlund Gray-Mane is the best smith in Skyrim. I plan to change a few minds about that.
This here's Candlehearth Hall. Great room's upstairs, an' there's a bed for rent on the ground floor.
Shatter-Shield, East Empire Company... we'll work for any ship that pulls in, as long as they can pay.
When Grimvar asks me why women are being killed around the city. I don't even know what to say to him.
At long last, Windhelm is free. No longer must we suffer persecution at the hands of Ulfric Stormcloak.
My job? Well, I'm the Watcher of the Wheel! Which is... exactly what it sounds like. I watch the Wheel.
[QUOTE]Windhelm's an easy posting![QUOTE] they said. Guess they didn't count on Ulfric's little uprising.
I once killed six men, single-handed, while rescuing my brothers-in-arms from ambush by an Imperial patrol.
The young folks are too happy to break their backs for the Nords. They forget what it was like to swim free.
Steel. Barehanded. Armor. Naked. It's all fighting. I can kill you with a weapon or by myself. No difference.
While you're on my boat, you follow my rules. First rule is, don't touch anything that doesn't belong to you.
By the gods, you're diseased. Get yourself to the White Phial and purchase a remedy, before you infect us all.
It's very important to Huki that all the battles are fair. What's more important to me is that my pay is fair.
The Dunmer get their drinks at the New Gnisis Cornerclub. Why they can't just call it a tavern is beyond me...
Ulfric Stormcloak was a true hero of Skyrim. He stood up to the Thalmor and refused to turn his back on Talos.
We ought dig a big hole, throw all them dark elves and Argonians in it, and let 'em tear each other to pieces.
The dark elves and Argonians won't soon forget Ulfric's prejudice, but I'm doing what I can to repair that rift.
Can't see why we let them dark elves live inside the walls. We should kick 'em out like we did to the scalebacks.
The Cruel-Seas have been sailors for generations. In truth, I regret not following in the footsteps of my ancestors.
Welcome to the House of Curiosities! I offer a brief tour for a few coins, or you can simply browse at your leisure.
I've no problem with Orcs. But that stronghold they've got in the southeast? Narzulbur? It's an affront to my people.
Luckily Windhelm is cold, so the dead don't rot as quickly. Sometimes the burial has to wait for the ground to thaw, though.
I've no problem with your kind, Orc. But that stronghold you've got in the southeast? Narzulbur? It's an affront to my people.
Watching the wheel isn't as simple as you might think. Have to inspect all the way around the ice, make sure it's not melting.
Ever since that Imperial craven ran me through from behind, I've had trouble breathing. Don't have any trouble drinking though.
South of here, and west of the road, lies Cronvangr Cave. Stay away from that cursed place, and the vampires that call it home.
Across the river to the northeast lies Yngol Barrow. Steer clear of that foul place, lest the walking dead claim you as their own.
Hello, hello, hello. Interested in fighting in the Pit? The rules are strict, but if I don't see it, it didn't happen, know what I mean?
What? Were you hoping to claim this house for yourself? Well, the Aretinos always liked me, so I think I'm family enough to take up here.
Maybe you've seen masts sticking out of the water to the northeast? That would be the wreck of the Winter War. Fine vessel, back in its day.
Tell me you've seen them. Those... things. Small and evil, like something out of a nightmare. They come from Stillborn Cave, to the north. I know it.
No. That won't be enough.
That is a fine idea. The stronghold would need the gold when I left to marry, anyway. I am ready when you are.
Not your concern, anyway.
We will endure. We always have.
Now tell me where she is!
Money, if that is what you wish.
Now, what is it you want?
I'm sorry about my housekeeper. She's a little protective of me.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Oh, that's just adorable.
And what about the dogs? How are those precious little angels?
Healthy and strong. Ysgramor's coat's gotten so thick, he looks fat!
Perhaps it was nothing...
A trick of the dark perhaps?
Please, just let me be...
Whatever it is, I'm sure I can't be of help. I'm just here on... holiday.
Quite a climb, wasn't it?
Anyway, much appreciated. Here, take this for your troubles.
Salmon sounds good today.
Speaking of sounding good, I've heard a couple of your classmates on the street recently.
As long as they're playing instruments they're passable. You don't want to hear them sing.
Shall we proceed, friend?
So that's a no I take it?
Care to have a drink with me, sweet Sigrid?
Drunk again, Embry? Don't let Alvor hear you talking to me that way. He'll stick your head in his forge.
That museum is a mistake.
The museum is opening, Madena.
Your ancestors wouldn't want this, Silus!
Why should I hide from it? This is my family's legacy!
It's the past! Dead oaths on dead lips. Let it stay there.
That was a long time ago.
That wasn't what I meant.
He's lonely. What do you expect?
Please, let's not have it come to that.
No matter. You'll take care of things like you always have.
I hear Mauhulakh is wandering again. He's after a new woman.
True... we could simply make sure she never reaches Narzulbur.
That's it! That's my bow!
That's not going to work.
Well, the Priesthood of Arkay always accepts generous donations.
That's putting it mildly.
I would refuse, but I don't want to jeopardize the peace between us.
The Thalmor invite me here to remind everyone that they can tell the Empire what to do.
The last one was warm up.
Spiced Wine for the Winking Skeever?
Sure, Sorex. Just like you did the last one.
Actually just a bottle for me today. I'm thinking of giving it to Vivienne.
The person who writes it.
And why wouldn't I be? We sing tales of kings, queens and their politics, 'tis true. But do you know who really makes history?
The Thalmor never forget.
You'll have a traitor's death.
Why struggle? The Thalmor will only send more like me.
Time to find another job.
Our business is done here.
The mine is closed. Get lost.
These Reach folk are so... nosy.
Strangers are nothing but trouble.
Don't have nothing to say to you, stranger.
You should talk to Ainethach. He's in charge.
Ragnar has a strong arm. Pity he isn't an Orc.
What do you want? Can't people leave us alone?
We're in control of this mine. No sudden moves.
Karthwasten has enough problems. Leave us alone.
You're not from here, and we don't need to be talking.
Ainethach is dead. What will happen to Karthwasten now?
Karthwasten doesn't need outsiders prying in our business.
I'm Ainethach's right-hand man. I help supervise the mines.
Ainethach's dead, but that doesn't mean we can stop working.
Ainethach's in charge of Karthwasten. You should bother him.
I work in the mines. I hunt. Everything else I do is my business.
I've been sent by Silver-Bloods to keep this mine [QUOTE]safe.[QUOTE]
Not many Nords would work for a Reachman, but Ainethach is a good man.
Sauranach mine is open again. How am I supposed to handle all this work?
The good mine is closed and the other mine has no ore. Gods have cursed me.
Finally, both of my mines are open again. Time for everyone to get back to work.
If the Forsworn aren't attacking my town, the Nords are trying to force me off it.
I'm one of the few native sons of the Reach that owns land. It doesn't make me very popular.
Time will prove me right.
That which is unknown can create unease, even fear. It is to be expected.
Some fear our new resident wizard. As they grow to know him, they will accept him.
Well met, mage of Skyrim.
Here in Shor's house we honor it still.
The Nords may have forgotten their forefathers' respect for the Clever Craft, but your comrades throng this hall.
Well, I... Don't you see?
Unlocking this mystery... The story alone is worth more riches than you can even imagine.
And perhaps... well, I don't wish to speculate, but... What if we could contact the dwarves? What if they're still out there? Imagine!
Well... just get it done.
So go dig at the other corner for a bit.
What did I tell you about snooping around my wards?
Woman, there's a vein of malachite as thick as my leg back there.
And if you don't let me secure the steam channel, your leg could get blown off.
What do you make of that?
The Greybeards are a strange bunch.
It's frightening living below their monastery.
Not sure what's up there, but I bet the Greybeards know.
Anything to break the boredom of living in this town. I envy you.
I've always fancied a journey up the 7,000 Steps to the monastery.
They call the path to the monastery the 7,000 Steps. Can you imagine?
Being masters of the Thu'um, they could kill you by uttering a single word.
The Greybeards stay away from me, and I stay away from them. Suits me just fine.
Other than that, they seem like a quiet lot. Don't really know too much about them.
Well, not that they would. They seem peaceful, but I wouldn't want to provoke them.
I'm not certain if I could even make it to the top without collapsing from exhaustion.
I heard they live their entire life without uttering a single word; can you even imagine?
Klimmek brings food supplies up to them once every few weeks when the weather permits it.
The Greybeards are a solitary lot. I don't think they've ever ventured outside their monastery.
I've been to the monastery many times, but I've never even laid eyes on one of the Greybeards. Not that I'd care to.
Always thought it was odd that there's a layer of thick clouds covering the peak of the mountain above the monastery.
Sometimes I swear I can hear strange noises rolling down from up there. It sounds like thunder, but there's never any rain.
We get the occasional pilgrim passing through here on their way to the summit, but almost all of them have returned disappointed.
What would you ask of me?
Drem Yol Lok. Greetings, wunduniik. I am Paarthurnax.
Who are you? What brings you to my strunmah... my mountain?
You are bold, wunduniik. You dare enter a Dovah's home without permission.
Not until introductions are complete. Zin. Heyv. Test your Thu'um against mine, Dovahkiin!
So. You have made your way here, to me. No easy task for a joor... mortal. Even for one of Dovah Sos. Dragonblood.
What? Oh... you're right.
She doesn't have the scar.
Brother, I think she's telling the truth...
I don't know who you think I am, and I don't care. Leave me alone!
I'm not going anywhere.  Now back off before I do something drastic.
Next time you're looking to pester someone, make sure it's the right person!
We've made a mistake. Now move along before that mouth of yours gets you into trouble.
Listen, wench, we're on to you. We know who you are, so you'd better come with us right now!
I don't have time for this foolishness. Now come along quietly and we won't have to get rough.
Won't lie, I am. And you?
Well, yes. Why wouldn't I be? Are you... interested in me?
I'd be a fool to turn down a chance of marrying you. I'm game if you're game!
I am. I'd be glad to stand by your side until the Divines take us, if you'll have me.
You're strong. Clever. I'd be proud to face the challenges of life with you, if you feel the same way.
You are pleasant company, more than pleasant. And what about you? Would you... be interested in a life together?
You have a kind heart. I'd be honored to walk by your side until the trees themselves fade away, if you would have me.
Wujeeta, we need to talk.
I know, I was late. I'm sorry.
Sigh. Very well. You're lucky Maramal has placed me in a very forgiving mood.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you. I can't just let this go unpunished.
Please, don't get rid of me! I need the coin. I... I'll work for free for the rest of this week. Please!
Yeah, I got one for sale.
It's for sale, if you've got the coin.
Not right now. You bought my last one.
Can't help you. They're all spoken for.
Don't mind if you do. What's your price?
Nope. Sold my last one to some stranger.
Don't have any that are for sale right now.
Reckon you can. How much you willing to pay?
If I had one you could. They're all spoken for.
If I had one. Sold my last one to you a bit ago.
That's what I'm here for. What are you offering?
Wish I did, but some outlander bought my last one.
That one with the saddle? How much are you offering?
Suppose so. Got one all saddled if you've got the coin.
Yes! Yes, you can. She's all saddled up and everything.
Not today. Sold my last one. Pretty sure I sold it to you.
Got one all saddled and ready to go. What are you willing to pay?
I've got one all saddled up for you! What do you figure she's worth?
Not today. You should have come by earlier. Wait, didn't I sell me last one to you?
You could if I had one. Sold my last available horse to someone that looked an awful lot like you.
Yes, thank you Arch-Mage.
Is there anything new I should be aware of, Mirabelle?
Everything's under control, then? Right. Keep up the good work.
There were also two items requiring disciplinary action recently.
I'm dealing with a few new research proposals, evaluating the results of three long-term projects, and keeping an eye on our new Apprentices.
You are not welcome here!
Now ain't this a surprise.
Who dares disturb my rest?
All the living shall fear the dead!
You picked a bad time to get lost, friend.
Lookee here. Looks like we got ourselves a hero.
You must bring her to us.
We cannot go after her, not without drawing attention.
Lead her to the Whiterun stables, outside of the city. We will wait for you there.
You ready to hear me out?
You will?! Oh, thank you!
You... you have? Already?
Well, J'zargo is surprised. And pleased! There is real competition here. This is good.
You've done well, hunter.
You've ruined everything!
I won't let you hurt Alva!
She's mine! She's my reward. You can't have her!
...I can't believe this...
It was all just a fabrication of this Wyndelius character? I can't believe we were so stupid.
A small test, if you will.
If you can pass the test, then yes.
Not just anyone is allowed inside. Those wishing to enter must show some degree of skill with magic.
It would seem that the College has what you seek. The question now is what you can offer the College.
Ah, you saw that, did you?
And then, the tragedy with Hroggar's home.
The men simply seek wisdom. Everything will be fine.
There's news of rebellion against the Empire. Strange noises have been heard in the marshes at night.
Life in Morthal has been troubled lately. The people are uncertain, restless. They merely look to the Jarl for leadership.
Are those parts ready yet?
I can only hammer so fast, Gerdur.
They don't have to be perfect. Just send them over when they're ready.
Are your sales going well?
Vittoria is practically glowing.
They seem to when you're around Silana.
I hope the Divines have been keeping you well.
Not too bad. A few of the guests from the upcoming wedding have placed orders.
It should be quite the affair. Nice to have something happy in the midst of the war.
Aye, that sounds like him.
As in all matters of faith, though, the reality is more complicated than one believer would tell you.
Bah! Stop wasting my time!
But I can't open the door.
She won't tell me her name.
I thought I was caught, but she started telling me even more secrets.
I've gotten good at listening to keyholes. At the door in the basement, I hear her talking to me.
But strength doesn't hurt.
How do you manage to hold your ground like that?
Well, no. I'm just saying there's more to defense than muscle.
You have to remember, it's not about strength. It's about leverage.
Don't even think about it.
Keep your hands to yourself.
Don't talk to me, defiler.
I have no words. Talk to Anwen.
I still don't have my Gleda back.
No Sam, no protection. Time to die.
Pick up your mess. Then we'll talk.
Don't come back until you have the ring.
The temple is still not clean. Get to it.
Once you leave the party you can't just come back.
Talk to me again when you've cleaned up your mess.
You can't have the ring back! You made a commitment!
I'm not going to talk to you until this mess is cleaned up.
Lets see how tough you are without Sam keeping an eye on you.
Go away. Go away. Go away!
Ah... so tender. Come here, you juicy morsel!
It's hopeless. He told me. He's right, you know.
You don't think there's any hope, do you? I don't. He's right.
He'll tell you. Just ask. You don't even need to ask. He'll tell you anyway.
I had a medal. It had someone's face on it. I threw it away, after. It didn't help.
I finally understand what it all means. What it was all for. The killing. And the dying.
They were golden, even when they were dead. But their blood was red. I knew it would be.
He explained it all to me. Before, when I still understood. I don't remember, but I still know.
Their fires lit up the night. All across Lake Rumare, like stars come to earth. It was beautiful, really.
Good luck. Mara bless you.
Lost the last one I gave you? Very well, here you are. Mara keep you.
I'm sorry, but even Mara's Temple needs coin. We will have a symbol ready for you when you come back with enough gold.
Here you are. Now remember, people in Skyrim respond to deeds. You will find more people interested in your love if you help them.
Good that you're so eager.
Good, you're finally here.
I've scouted the ruins and I'm certain Karliah is still inside.
Good. Here, take this key.
Sorry, guess it's too rich for your blood. Come back when you find the coin.
The Balmora Blue is locked in a chest under the docks near the Red Wave. Hope you like getting wet.
Hope nobody misses that...
Hey, someone had to take it, right?
That was just lying around? Good find.
You just find that lying around? Must be your lucky day.
Lucky for you that was just sitting there for the taking.
Oh, wow! That was just sitting there? I wish I found it first.
What'd you pick up there? Oh, I wish I saw that first. You're so lucky!
How are you today, Thaena?
Don't sass me, little girl.
Always looking on the bright side, aren't you.
Same as ever. Trying to keep from freezing to death, trying to keep food on the table.
Hurry! Get me out of here!
Hey you! Let me out! I can help!
Hey! Over here! Get me out of here!
No! Don't leave me here! I beg you to let me out!
Actually... on second thought, I'll just kill you!
Use the key to open the door! We have to be quick!
Please! I'll pay you. I'll give you whatever you want. Just don't leave me here!
Now that we've got that out of the way, I'll take everything you have... or your life.
I'm glad they didn't find my lucky dagger. It's time to gut these rotten birds. Lead the way!
Please, you can't leave me in here! If you let me out I can show you where they hide their best treasure.
One of those things has the key to this cage. If you get me out of here I'll help you slaughter the rest of those crows.
Please! Help me get out of this cage. I don't know why those things locked me up and I don't want to wait around to find out.
I can take care of myself.
Come on, Ton. Marry me. Let me take care of you.
I don't want to settle. I like things the way they are.
Why can't you just settle down and run the Flagon with me?
I have no idea what to do!
I... I don't know. Ancano is gone, but whatever he's done to the Eye doesn't seem to have stopped.
I hope I didn't scare you.
I'm... I'm sorry you had to see that.
I look forward to it then.
Of course. Your training isn't complete yet.
Unmid, my sweet. Are we still meeting later for... combat training?
I must return to Markarth.
I take care of my friends.
Since I know losing the farm's payments will harm the Guild, I intend to make a substantial contribution for compensation.
I will commune with Azura.
I'll show you what I know.
I can teach you a few things.
They'll never see you coming.
I can. It might save your life.
You wish to do what I do? Very well.
Well, you've come to the right place.
I think I can teach you a thing or two.
It's all in the swing. Let me show you.
I'll gladly share my knowledge with you.
Use it right, and you won't feel a thing.
Mind what - or who - you practice this on.
I can certainly share a bit of what I know.
You wish to learn from the best, eh? So be it.
Your power over others shall be great, like mine.
It's an honorable craft. I'll show you what I can.
I'll show you what I can about protecting yourself.
I'll teach you some of what I know, but be careful.
All right, but if you get arrested don't blame it on me.
Stick with me, and they'll never even know you're there.
I shall explain to you the mysteries of the outer realms.
Up to no good, are we? I'll teach you, but it'll cost you.
You've come to the right place. I'd be happy to teach you.
You'll never compare to me, but I can try and teach you anyway.
You deal with powerful forces. Take care they do not overwhelm you.
It's as rewarding as it is dangerous. Let's see what I can show you.
You'll be able to run circles around the big, slow brutes in Heavy Armor.
I'll teach you how to use it effectively, and keep you quick on your feet.
I can teach you, but I won't be held responsible for what you do with the knowledge.
I can show you a few things, but anyone asks, and my name never comes up. Understand?
I'm glad we agree on this.
Maybe so, but we shouldn't be making concessions before negotiations even start. Makes us look weak.
Maybe so, but I can't be making concessions before negotiations even start. It makes the Empire look weak.
In time, I believe I will.
Into the tunnel. Let's go.
It's all been for nothing.
And just why would you be doing that?
Oh, it doesn't matter now. Gavros is never coming back, and he was supposed to have the crystal. Without that, we're lost.
So congratulations, whoever you are, you've found the Synod. Just me, alone, surrounded by angry machines and angrier Falmer.
It's not worth dying over.
Leave... Leave... Leave...
Leave this place... Leave this place...
Let me see that journal...
Let's see if this works...
Perhaps some more Glow Dust in the next batch of potions. That should increase their resistance.
No, but that won't account for the size issue. Blast, if only so many of these creatures hadn't escaped.
Mine's closed. Move along.
We're getting back to work as best we can.
This mine will be our grave yet. I just know it.
We're going to need an army to clear out that crypt.
We're keeping the mine closed until that crypt is clear.
I'm not going into the mine with draugr lurking down there.
Any day now more draugr are going to come out of that crypt.
Hard to believe there'd be an old crypt underneath the mine.
There's still plenty of ore left in that mine. What a waste.
Mining out this old rock is a lot quieter, now. Thank the Divines.
We tunneled into an old crypt. We're warning strangers to keep out.
It's crazy to still be working here. What if there's more draugr down there?
I hear talk about a regiment coming to clear the crypt out. We'll see if that happens.
Guards are useless. They just stand around waiting for a full regiment to come and help.
No, not recently at least.
And most of us are quite satisfied with that.
We don't mistake that for acceptance, though. Odds are they're simply too afraid to confront us directly.
No, which is fine with me.
You haven't heard any more about dragon sightings, have you?
Bottle... their flame? I can't... No, I don't think I've any interest in that sort of thing.
A pity. You have any idea how much fangs would be worth? Or even better -- bottle their flame. The right buyer would pay an immense amount.
Not a failure, my servant.
Not half as sorry as I am.
Oh, and one final thing...
Father, you worry too much. I'll be fine.
Farewell, father. I'll return as soon as I'm able.
Walk in Gaius Maro's shadow, and deliver to him the judgment of Sithis.
Gaius Maro still lives. I am surprised. I had assumed you were more... competent.
Oh, Faida. I may travel alone, but you know I carry you always in my heart. I'll see you soon.
Once he's dead, plant the incriminating letter on his body, and let fate take care of the rest.
Son, when the Emperor's safety is concerned, anything could go wrong. Off with you, now. And good travels.
He is set to leave the Penitus Oculatus outpost at Dragon Bridge, and inspect the security of each city in Skyrim.
Go there now. Observe Gaius Maro's departure, and follow him. Waylay him in one of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis.
I understand. But you're being paranoid. I'm inspecting security, not charging off into battle. There's not a lot that can go wrong.
Well, this is it, then. Look after yourself, Gaius. You're doing your duty, and I'm proud of you. But you'd better come back to me. You hear?
I know you will. But all the same, remember everything I said. Stay alert, and when you get to the cities, make your observations and move on.
Oh, look! We have company!
Do you need anything? Are you hungry?
I feel wonderful, just like every night.
Oh Hroggar, you know I'm always hungry. Don't worry, I'll eat when I need to.
Oh, yes, right, of course!
Oh. Um. Well... You see...
Ho, now... Keep me out of this...
Oooh. Ahhh... Well... See, the thing is...
Oh, Dorthe. You're breaking your mother's heart, you know that?
Wow. Yeah. That sounds great, mother. Only, um... it's just that...
I'm sorry, mother. I can't help it. All that stuff you like to do, it's just so... boring.
Shor's crown! There are things ladies like us are supposed to do. We've talked about this...
Let me guess. You'd rather play [QUOTE]Daedra and Battlemages[QUOTE] with Ordnar. Or go fishing, or catch frogs...
Well. I can see your father and I are going to have to talk about this. And when we do, things are going to change.
Just stop trying to change me, mother! I'm not a baby anymore! I'm almost a woman! I... I can't be who I want to be!
Dorthe, dear, I've been growin' some really lovely vegetables. Maybe tomorrow you could help me plant a new patch? What do you say?
Fine. You play in the mud, or play with your father's forge, or get into sword fights with your little friend. But this is not over.
Dorthe... I was thinkin' I'd knit a couple of blankets, sell them to Lucan. Would you like to make one? Might be fun, workin' together.
Dorthe, listen to me. Your father and your friend may treat you like a boy, but you're not. Do you understand? So please. Be a girl. For me.
It's just that papa promised I could make something at the forge. So maybe we could do something together, hmmm... next week? Is... that okay?
You know, Dorthe, with all those vegetables I've been growing lately, I was thinkin' we could make a right lovely stew. Together. How about it?
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.
You can't get inside though. They've kept that place locked up tight since the war began.
I get my skooma from Sarthis Idren. He has some sort of a setup over at the Riften Warehouse.
She just wouldn't hear it.
It was brave of you to come to me with this. I can't thank you for it, not for this, but you have done me a service.
I told her. I told her the imperial army would kill her. That this was a war of Jarls and Imperial Generals and we had no part in it.
She... She didn't make it.
When it was clear we were going to have to fall back, she stayed behind and made sure the rest of us were all right.
The intruder has vanished.
I've failed... the mortal has escaped.
Then I must do this alone.
Then stop wastin' my time.
Don't blame me if your feet get sore.
Off with ya then. I've got work to do.
Then what are you wasting my time for?
Should have known you'd be a cheap one.
Didn't think you had the coin for it anyway.
Then off with ya. I've got better things to do.
Walkin' never hurt nobody. If you change your mind, I'll be here.
Oh. Was it something I said? I can't afford to lower the price, but come back if you change your mind.
Then stop wasting my time.
By Ysgramor's axe! It's true. Morthal owes you a debt.
So it's true. That traitorous bitch! Morthal owes you a debt.
Here is your reward for solving the murder, but I have another request.
Here. You were promised a reward for solving the crime, but I need one more favor from you.
Morthal is still in danger. The journal mentions Movarth, a master vampire I thought was destroyed a century ago.
I'll gather together some able-bodied warriors to clean out Movarth's lair. They'll be waiting outside for you to lead them.
Unfortunately Morthal is still in danger. The journal mentions Movarth, a powerful master vampire that I had assumed was destroyed.
This is not just a dagger!
Keening, and its counterpart, Sunder. Used by the tonal architects of the Dwemer to tap into the Heart of Lorkhan.
This is a dwarven artifact beyond nearly all value. A singular instrument of immense power, a tool of impossible import.
To maintain relationships.
By the way, I don't know who you are, but unless you want me to blow your cover, I'd advise that you avoid me for the rest of the party.
Uuuuhhhnnnn... it hurts...
(coughing fit) Uuughhnnn...
Uuuuhhhnnnn... aaarrrghhh....
Ooohhhh, ahhhrrrghhhh... uuuuggghhh.
Uhhh... (coughing, wheezing) ... ahhhh...
Aaaahhhhhrrrr.... the pain, somebody, stop... the pain...
We could fix you right up.
I do. So few people possess the taste and sophistication of a proper wardrobe these days.
Be sure and investigate Radiant Raiment's fine selection of clothing. We have many items you'll fancy, I'm sure.
Nothing at all. It's very... nice. If you want something with a little more style, however, you should see what we have available.
Nothing at all. It's very... nice. If you want something with a little more style, however, you should come by our shop. Radiant Raiment.
We knew you would succeed.
Your victory here justifies our belief in you. You have proven yourself more than worthy to guide the College of Winterhold.
We're off to a good start.
Hmm. I guess I'll defer to your judgment on this one, but I think it's a mistake.
Well, is it taken care of?
Ah, so they've finally sent someone to deal with that lunatic.
Well, no... I... I mean...
You... You're wrong! You can't hurt me anymore...
Braith. I.... I've come to tell you that I'm not afraid of you anymore.
That's what I thought. Now get out of my way, baby. I got things to do.
Oh no? So you're gonna fight back if I punch you? Huh? You're gonna hit a girl?
Don't make me laugh, baby Battle-Born. You'll be afraid of me till the day I kill you.
What do you think, genius?
I'm kneeling here with my hands bound and a sack over my head, and you have the gall to ask me that?
What is the music of life?
What? A dragon? In Helgen?
That explains what I saw earlier... flying down the valley from the south... I was hoping I was wrong about what I thought it was...
What? That's not possible!
Most impressive, mortal... most impressive.
Where the Dragon attacked?
We've heard rumors of death and... and fire from the skies. But no real news.
Wonderful, just wonderful!
And that's it. I certainly think you deserve the first copy of the tome. Use it well!
And it's just as I suspected. The energies need to be channeled back through the nexus a second and third time...
Wonderful. Where to begin?
We also perform wedding ceremonies for all the loving couples in Skyrim.
Mara is the Goddess of Love. The temple spreads her gifts by tending to the sick, the poor, and the lost.
Yeah, it was stupid of me.
I shouldn't have believed the story and just refused the trade. But I didn't, and now I'm stuck with this worthless junk.
Yes, Arch-Mage. Thank you.
What did you tell them last time?
Should we consider investigating the matter?
That hasn't changed, has it? Then just tell them again.
No, I don't think so. Respond to their request, and we'll leave it at that.
Arch-Mage, the Synod have contacted us again, asking if we've any word on their researchers. What shall I tell them?
That they had arrived, asked for information which was provided to them, and went on their way with no suggestion of further interaction.
You don't have time? Fine.
You got here just in time.
We're outnumbered, but I have a plan.
That was crafty. I'm sure having a steward in the pocket will come in handy.
Lucky for us, that the wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now. Just up the road!
You looking for something?
I thank you for your help, my friend.
I told you everything I know. What else did you want?
You need to not bother me.
What do you want, new blood?
I'm in charge of the prisoners here.
No funny business. I'm watching you.
What do you want? Have digging to do.
You serve your time by digging. So dig.
You're not in here for life, like I am.
You're talking to a killer, remember that.
Cidhna Mine's for prisoner scum only. Keep out.
You do something out of line, I'll put you down.
I left behind my daughter Uaile when I was taken.
I catch you stealing anything, I'll break your neck.
I was sent here because someone said I was a Forsworn.
You mess with the Silver-Blood family, you end up here.
I got locked up one too many times. Now I'm in for life.
I'm just another Forsworn sent to rot here in this mine.
Prison's not so bad. Less complaints when I kill people.
Whenever I get out of here, I'm going to go kill a Nord.
Don't reach for a shiv around me, or we'll both regret it.
I swear, if I ever get out of here, I'm giving up thieving. Really.
You should just serve your time. Find an ore vein and start digging.
How old is my daughter now, I wonder? In prison, you lose track of time.
I'm innocent. The Nords framed me. I was nowhere near that murder weapon.
Other prisoners get suspicious when we talk to each other, so keep it down.
I wonder how grandma Bothela is doing. She's probably worried sick about me.
Jarl decided I was too much of a problem. Threw me in here with the Forsworn.
Now this is real guard duty. Just throw them in the mine and be done with it.
Violent one, huh? Best keep that to yourself, new blood. Others find out, they'll consider that a challenge.
You're just getting older.
That's why I come here to talk to you. You're all heart.
Tough day at the mines. I swear the ore is getting harder to dig.
[QUOTE]Our[QUOTE] business?
If you have a moment, I've come up with a few ideas I wanted to share.
Look, I'm merely suggesting a few things that could expand our business.
I'm becoming sick to death of your ideas. Not one of them has paid off since you moved in.
As I remember things, it was you that showed up at my doorstep looking for a job and a place to live. Try and remember that.
And so you shall be tested.
Arrogance will serve you poorly. Your worth must be determined before knowledge can be bestowed upon you.
And they were no base prey.
You continue to amuse and impress. Go forth, with my blessing.
By bringing down my other Hunters, you turned the chase inside out.
And? Were they magnificent?
Are we running low on mead?
No. Even Ranmir can only drink so much.
I suppose that's a benefit to having so few customers.
Let's just keep an eye on the supply. It's such a chore to restock.
No, without Ranmir around we're running out of stock far less often than we used to.
Arise! Arise and defend us!
At last, a worthy opponent!
Azura's Star is ours. Ours!
Come... embrace your death!
This place will be your tomb!
Become one with the Evergloam!
Draw your last breath, mortal!
Did something happen to it?
Do the bees need to be happy?
Have you heard about Goldenglow Meadery?
Of course! You can't make good mead without happy honey!
All the apiaries... it will take years to get those bees happy again.
Did you need anything else?
Do you think it's gone yet?
We've got to find someplace to hide!
Don't you know there's a dragon attacking?
I wouldn't go out there for all the money in the world.
I'm not going out there. Not with that dragon on the loose.
No, you don't want to go up there! A dragon... it's attacking!
Does that cover everything?
Yes, I know Winterhold used to be full of my kind, and no I don't care that they're all gone now.
Before you even ask, yes I have an ancestry steeped in magic, and no I don't want to talk about it.
Don't delay, Shield-Sister.
Don't delay, Shield-Brother.
Even while making parts up.
Seems like most of these are nine parts fiction.
A good story is nine parts truth and one part fiction.
Can we really just make things up? It doesn't seem right.
Read carefully. You will see there are ways to stay true to the essence, Illdi.
Get that thing out of here!
It's still here! Get it out!
Help! Get that beast out of my house!
Thank you! I thought that beast would be the end of me!
Got my hands full as usual.
There's plenty that needs doing.
Good. I can use someone I can trust.
Excellent. I have a couple tasks for you.
Good. I have some things that need doing.
Good. I'm spread thin. I could use the help.
I'm in the middle of something. But don't go far. I'll need you soon.
I've got my hands full with something. Don't go far. I'll need you soon.
Ha ha! Don't make me laugh.
All right, all right, let's not get too hasty now.
Just stay out of the Black-Briars' affairs. You'll live longer.
Have it your own way, meat.
Here, you should have this.
Hey, you. Stop right there!
Empty your pockets or end up as skeever food.
Hey. You wanna play a game?
Honest pay for honest work.
We could always use help picking crops if you need a few extra coins.
I am not yours to toy with!
I do. Still want to buy it?
It's damn near impossible to find anymore. You want to buy it off of me?
Well then, you're talking to the right person. I'm the only one left in Tamriel that can get my hands on it.
I don't know, I don't know!
Just... Do whatever it takes to get him to stop lording this over me.
I've already agreed to pay him quite handsomely for the... well, the item in question.
I expected better from you.
I should have known better than to expect you to give us a fair hearing.
I showed up to watch, yeah.
It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
I don't know if they were right to execute him for what he did, but I'll tell you something...
I spit on you, dead sister.
Petra, you traitorous grouse! Die!
Who enters? Will nobody save poor Melka?
Ah, my parlor. No finer place to boil eyes, no...
Yes, kind morsel. Let us go up, and mind Melka on the way.
Press only middle button! Clever trick, yes? Nobody ever thinks of the middle.
Careful here, there's a trick to this. Trick is to not bleed to death. Ah, and there's a lever, too.
I won't take no for answer!
I'm not going to ask again.
I've already said too much.
I gave you what you came here for, now go. Leave me in peace.
Indeed. That would be best.
Interesting. Same dragon...
Damn it, we're blundering around in the dark here! We need to figure out who's behind it all!
Is Ulfric's armor done yet?
No, I want to take my time with it.
I did that engraved piece just last month!
Can I help with it? Maybe just the cuirass?
This is more delicate work than you're used to.
This is the royal armor, lass. Maybe in a few years.
Just like Ysgramor himself.
Look at you, up to no good.
Are you playing hide and seek?
You, my friend, need practice...
It will keep it's hands to itself, yes?
What? Why are you skulking about like that?
You're not a thief trying to rob me, right?
I trust you aren't considering any... thievery.
I hope you're not planning on picking my pocket.
You trying to hide? 'Cause I can see you plain as day.
You remind me of the Shadowscales, from the old histories.
Umm... are you in trouble? Is that why you're hiding like that?
You're a bad sneak. You're not creeping up on anybody like that.
Look, it's all very simple.
The Dwemer, they were uhh, masters of magic in a way we can't even begin to conceive of.
Their greatest achievement, however, has also been their greatest, shall we say... Mystery.
Madanach. The King in Rags.
Until Ulfric came and put them down.
While we were off fighting the Elves in the Great War, Madanach was busy ruling over the Reach.
Man gives bards a bad name.
We Nords have a long history as warrior poets. I am proud to count myself among them.
But Mikael... He sings only for gold and the affections of wenches. He dishonors our traditions.
No. Gods no, not for years.
I left Winterhold for some time, and returned to stay here at the inn.
I still have research that keeps me busy, and being here in Winterhold ensures I have access to former colleagues.
Not a chance. Get'em, boys!
Oh, I didn't see you there.
Oh, well done. Very subtle.
Is it that time again already?
We'll need to visit each home for an assessment.
Stop it, both of you. You're acting like children.
Hold your tongue, Wizard, or you're likely to lose it.
I should very much like to see you try it, my dear steward.
Very well, let's meet this evening and make the arrangements.
It's nearly time to collect taxes on your properties here in the city, Bryling.
Oh, I'm sorry, did I imply that you'd be meeting for purposes other than court business? You must forgive me.
Patience, sister. Patience.
My contact, she says Hammerfell steel is much desired by certain parties.
Why should we settle for half a fin when we could just take the whole whale?
I know of a ship coming in from Hammerfell. Some cargo might get [QUOTE]lost[QUOTE]...
Please, get me out of here!
Derkeethus, from Darkwater Crossing.
Should have known better than to swim all the way to the falls.
Please, let me out of here!
I don't have them anymore. She took them... The Caller. She's the one who put me in here!
Ralof? How do you know him?
Of course. Take what you need.
But what's this all about? What are you two doing here?
Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can. Help yourself to whatever you need, within reason.
Of course. Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
Revenge? How interesting...
Aye, lass... and I've come to a decision.
It helped avert attention from our true nature.
Okay, lass. We've got these getups on... now what?
What sort of arrangement? I need to know the terms.
This isn't about religion, Brynjolf... it's business.
If it means the end of Mercer Frey, you can count me in.
Very well, the conditions are acceptable. You may proceed.
Beyond this gate is the first step in becoming a Nightingale.
What's wrong, Brynjolf? I can almost hear your brow furrowing.
And in the future, I'd suggest you refrain from disappointing me again.
If she's to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must be struck.
You surprise me, Karliah. This offer is definitely weighted in my favor.
My appetite for Mercer's demise exceeds my craving for wealth, Your Grace.
To hold any hope of defeating Mercer, we must have Nocturnal at our backs.
Yes. That's why we need to prepare ourselves and meet Mercer on equal footing.
Ah, Karliah. I was wondering when I'd hear from you again. Lose something did we?
Aye, there's always a catch. But at this point, I suppose there isn't much to lose.
I call upon you Lady Nocturnal, Queen of Murk and Empress of Shadow... hear my voice!
We have to be very careful, Brynjolf. Mercer is a Nightingale, an Agent of Nocturnal.
I have two others that wish to transact the Oath; to serve you both in life and in death.
Just outside of Riften, beyond the Southeast Gate is a small path cut up the mountainside.
We will honor our agreement in this life and the next until your conditions have been met.
Very well. I name your initiates Nightingale and I restore your status to the same, Karliah.
The assumption that the Nightingales were just a myth was seeded within the Guild on purpose.
Now, if you'll both proceed to the armory to don your Nightingale Armor, we can begin the Oath.
Woah there, lass. I appreciate the armor, but becoming a Nightingale? That was never discussed.
At the end of that path is a clearing and an old standing stone. I'd ask you both meet me there.
And in return, both in life and in death, you must serve as a guardian of the Twilight Sepulcher.
This is Nightingale Hall. You're the first of the uninitiated to set foot inside in over a century.
You're already mine, Karliah. Your terms were struck long ago. What could you possibly offer me now?
I'm trying to understand why I'm here, lass. I'm no priest, and I'm certainly not religious. Why pick me?
My Lady, I've come before you to throw myself upon your mercy and to accept responsibility for my failure.
Lady Nocturnal, we accept your terms. We dedicate ourselves to you as both your avengers and your sentinels.
So, this is Nightingale Hall. I heard about this place when I joined the Guild, but I never believed it existed.
Brynjolf, the time has come to decide Mercer's fate. Until a new Guild Master is chosen, the decision falls to you.
Mercer Frey tried to kill both of you, he betrayed the Guild, murdered Gallus and made us question our future. He needs to die.
The terms are quite simple, Brynjolf. Nocturnal will allow you to become a Nightingale and use your abilities for whatever you wish.
Then it's all true... everything I heard in the stories. The Nightingales, their allegiance to Nocturnal and the Twilight Sepulcher.
Rip the eyes from her head!
Rip the eyes from his head!
You'll serve me soon enough.
Don't applaud yourself too soon, worm!
None can stand against the Wolf Queen!
Not much further. Come, little thing. Serve me in death.
You've come far, mortal. No doubt you seek to enter Potema's Sanctum.
You've come far, mortal, but can you stand against my inner council?  Let's see!
I can see to that. We'll need plenty of fresh corpses to rebuild her army, you see.
You've arrived at last. The hero who prevented me from being bound returns to my fold.
You've arrived at last. The heroine who prevented me from being bound returns to my fold.
I have much to thank you for, little one. When you die I will raise you and you can take your place by my side.
Sigh. What is it now, dear?
Hafjorg! Where did you put it woman?!
Ah, I see. Well, just be careful around my things!
Oh my. Elgrim, it's on the shelf to the right of the table, as always.
Don't you [QUOTE]dear[QUOTE] me! I had a bowl of Vampire Dust on my worktable not an hour ago and after you swept in there it's gone!
Thank you. Do hurry please.
Thanks again for your help.
That's my brother up there.
Roggvir... Why did it have to be like this?
That's what I like to hear.
So long as you can back up those words with steel.
There is no more life here.
Gone. The living are right to fear the dead.
This isn't about the money.
That's more gold than they're offering. Fine. I'll sell.
Today is a good day to die.
Fight well, and I'll make sure your corpse is not dishonored.
Token, you say? Let me see.
Oh, goodness me. You're a friend of Gabriella's, then. Well, I guess we both know why you're here.
Um... yes, of course, sir.
What's the current spirit among the dark elves?
Carry on, Lonely-Gale. And loosen yourself a bit.
Well that much is good. Let's finish this first war before starting the next one, eh?
As restless as ever, sir, but I don't see them taking any kind of incendiary action. Not soon, anyway.
Very well, I'll try milady.
Sorry Lady Dinya, but I've been busy of late.
When are you going to stop by the temple, Madesi?
It only takes but a moment to say a silent prayer to Mara. Please come by soon; not for me, but for yourself.
We fought them off, but...
The old man... Kodlak... he's dead.
The Silver Hand. They finally found enough courage to attack Jorrvaskr.
We're with you, Dragonborn.
Well, not a great deal, no.
If I wasn't married to Ulfberth, I'd be out of business.
But I do less business than I used to. The Stormcloaks don't like buying from anyone that isn't a Nord.
What are you doing in here?
Stay where you are. The mother will deal with you.
What are you talking about?
Come on, everyone knows about you and Brynjolf.
Hey Ton, you shouldn't cheat on Vekel. He's a good guy.
Well, everyone's wrong. Now why don't you just shut up about it.
What troubles you, husband?
What? Oh, nothing. All is well.
Still, I fear there is some connection.
It's Joric. I fear his condition is worse.
Joric will be what Joric will be. Give it time.
He calls out in his sleep sometimes. I've heard Falion's name. What does it mean?
What? The Emperor? But I...
Oh. Oh, by the gods, no. No, you can't do this. You can't!
Why? Who says I have to be?
Skyforge Steel is my art and honor. The Companions need the best, so they come to me.
You have my thanks, friend.
May prosperity bless us both!
I'll work hard to justify your faith in me.
If you have spare weapons and armor to sell, bring them here.
I'll start planning how best to spend this. You have my thanks!
Ah, look at the pretty, shiny coins. Now, how best to spend them?
Thank you so much! With this coin, I'll be able to double my stock.
Wise is the one who spends a few coins now to make a fortune later.
You'll look back on this as one of your best decisions, I swear it.
Thank you. When I have the time, I'll try to think of how best to use this.
I'll call upon my suppliers this very evening and arrange to double my orders.
Ah, the sound of clinking coins. Even better, the sound of clinking coins in my hand!
If you want to make the most of your investment, you'll come here to sell your goods.
More coin means more supplies, and that means more useful balms, potions and remedies for everyone.
A wise choice, my friend. After all, what would a common adventurer know about the complexities of finance?
You ready to take the Oath?
I misjudged you. You're definitely Stormcloak material.
It's time we made this official. You ready to take the Oath?
What? We've got nothing to talk about until you come back from Serpentstone Isle.
You're alive. I owe Ulfric a drink. I have to admit, I didn't think we'd be seeing you again.
You won't like it, my lady.
I told you you wouldn't like the news.
What news have you heard from the war, Irnskar?
I'm well aware that I won't like it. But it's my duty to keep my people safe. Tell me.
I'm not just talking about my subjects. I'm talking about my people: the proud Nords of Skyrim.
Possession of the holds change on an almost daily basis, but I can report that Haafingar is still secure. Your people are safe.
You're serious, aren't you?
What? You, alone, reasoning with the Thalmor? That's madness, friend.
Ah well, it was a long shot.
Awww, well, maybe next time.
But I will heed your wishes.
There's no shame in such thoughts. A man without doubts is a man without a conscience.
But rest assured. We've won Skyrim's right to determine her own future. And for that, every Nord praises us.
Can't stop to chat, citizen.
No time to talk. Out of my way.
Come to gawk at the monster?
Consider it forgotten, boss.
All right, whatever you want.
Here's your share. Well done.
Good... here's your assignment.
Nicely done. Here's your share.
Suit yourself. You're the boss.
Good. Here's what you need to do.
Here you go, boss. All the details.
All-righty. Good luck out there, boss.
Fine. Just keep it clean. Here you go.
Great. Watch yourself out there, boss.
Here you go. Hope you don't muck it up.
All right. Take this and get out of here.
Fine. Here's everything you need to know.
Fine. I guess you'll need your coin then.
Good job. Now here's your part of the deal.
Now that's what I like to hear. Off you go.
Whatever, just get it done. Here's the job.
When you find your nerves, then we'll talk.
Finally, someone with backbone. Here you go.
Nice. Here, this is what you'll need to know.
No problem, I'll get someone else to take it.
I suppose you want your share now? Here you go.
A pleasure as always, boss. Here's your payment.
Didn't muck it up I hear. Good. Here's your share.
You're not going to get richer with that attitude.
Fine. I'll just keep all this coin for myself then.
Sure, no problem. We'll find someone else to do it.
Your not winnin' points with me with that attitude.
Don't even give it a second thought. Maybe next time.
Couldn't have done it better myself. Here's your coin.
Here's your gold. Try not to spend it all in one place.
Yeah, your right. Probably a waste of your time anyway.
And here's the spoils. Plenty more where this came from!
No problem, I'll find someone else. Don't worry about it.
I can pat you on the back all day, but coin's coin, right?
Oh, you're back? I suppose you'll be wanting your pay then.
Keep droppin' these jobs and I might quit assignin' them to you.
Amazing what people leave laying around for us to take, isn't it?
And here I thought you were a master criminal. Guess I was wrong.
Make up your mind, will you? You're starting to make us look bad.
And with no strings attached. Not bad. Here, got some coin for you.
Hey, you approached me. You want to play coward, that's your problem.
This kind of work suits you... and is going to end up makin' you rich.
Fine. Next time, save me the trouble and pass on it from the beginning.
Got all your gold ready, boss. You can count every coin, it's all there.
Here's everythin' you need. You get caught, and we've never heard of you.
Too bad, looks like I need to find someone else to take care of business.
If you don't watch it, I may actually start to respect you. Job well done.
Keep this up and you'll be rich enough retire before you know it. Good luck.
Look, I don't like wasting my time. Come back when you decide to get serious.
You did the job and you did it clean; that's all we ever ask. Enjoy the gold.
I hardly noticed you were gone. Got your share of the spoils right here, boss.
Here. Just don't make me look like an ass in front of the Guild and mess it up.
Just remember the rules... keep it clean and keep it quiet. Here's the details.
Keep turning down jobs like this and the Guild will begin to lose respect for you.
Not interested? Fine. Then let me offer it to someone with a little more backbone.
Sorry, boss. Had to use your share to cover expenses after you done and got messy.
First you take the job, now you don't even want it. I wish you'd make up your mind.
Good, just remember the order: do job first, get drunk second. Now take this and go.
Fine, but you're not gettin' any wealthier by weaslin' out of everythin' I offer you.
You need to bloody well get your priorities straight if you want to make it around here.
This ain't the Dark Brotherhood. Next time, you keep the job clean and you'll get your coin.
Just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine. Let me give you the details.
You an assassin or a thief? Next time, keep your blade sheathed if you want to make any gold.
I want to pay you, but I had to cover up the murder. Didn't expect you to go on a killing spree.
What's the matter with you? We said keep it clean! Well, you can just forget about your payment.
If you think you'll make your fortune kickin' around the Flagon all day, that's where your wrong.
You idiot! We have to cover your mess up and that costs us gold... which means you don't get any.
Good going... you got arrested. Now how do you think that looks for the Guild? Better luck next time.
Are you bloody serious? You're not going to get ahead by quitting around here, that I can promise you.
Are you out of your mind? We said no bloodshed! Well, guess what. You can just forget about your gold.
I thought it was crystal clear... no one dies on these jobs. Remember that next time you want to get paid.
Sure you finished, but you killed someone to do it. Next time listen to the rules if you want to get paid.
You drew blood, so you aren't getting paid. That's the rules. You don't like it, take it up with Brynjolf.
Look, I told the client you probably had a good reason to kill the mark, but well, they demanded reparations.
Sorry, I don't have a single septim left after paying the town guard to keep quiet about the mark you killed.
You needed to do this clean and quiet, and you failed. Now we need to use your payment to cover your mistake.
I hope you weren't expectin' to get paid for this blundered job. Next time, the mark stays alive... you hear me?
Being connected to a criminal didn't make the client happy... next time, act like a real thief and don't get caught.
Gettin' pinched and endin' up in jail doesn't cut it with our clients. If you want to get paid next time, stay clean.
Look, if you just want to sit around the Flagon all day getting drunk, that's your business. Just quit wasting my time.
You need to start pulling your own weight around here, otherwise I might [QUOTE]forget[QUOTE] to offer you any more jobs.
The last time I checked, gold coins aren't falling from the heavens. You better take some jobs if you want to earn your share.
I'm afraid I had to pay off a few officials to keep you out of jail, boss. Expensive to get murder off the books, know what I mean?
You can't keep quittin' jobs when it strikes your fancy. You're going to make us all look like a bunch of amateurs. Think next time.
Now don't get cross with me, but the officials are demanding compensation for the mark you killed. Had to do it... had no choice, boss.
I had to use your pay to smooth things over with the client. They didn't want to be associated with a criminal. Next time, don't get arrested.
Did he now? I can only hope.
You still have the witches' heads? Excellent. Throw one of them into the fire. It will release their magic, for me at least.
Did you see a Dog out there?
Do you believe this old hag?
Come on, father. There's nothing more to be said here.
[QUOTE]Holding him[QUOTE]? Why I've got him in my cellar. He's my prisoner.
Foolish old woman! You know nothing! Nothing of our struggles, our suffering!
Nothing? And what of my son? Hmm? What of Thorald? Is he nothing? So don't talk to me about suffering!
Your son chose his side, and he chose poorly. And now he's gone. Such is the way of war. The sooner you accept his loss, the better.
Face it, cow! Your stupid son is dead! He died a Stormcloak traitor. And you... you best keep your mouth shut before you suffer the same.
I will never accept his death! My son still lives. I feel it in my heart. So tell me, Battle-Borns, where is he? Where are you holding my Thorald?
Don't keep waiting, soldier.
Don't want to talk about it.
Don't you walk away from me!
Exactly as I said it would.
Now, are you ready to try again? I am confident it will work this time.
Extraordinary. I see it now.
The sealing structure interlocks in the tiniest fractals.
Dwemer blood can loose the hooks, but none alive remain to bear it.
The blood of Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer, and Orsimer. The elves still living provide the key.
Bear you hence this extractor. It will drink the fresh blood of elves. Come when its set is complete.
A panoply of their brethren could gather to form a facsimile. A trick. Something they didn't anticipate, no, not even them.
For the glory of the Empire.
Foreigners. What a nuisance!
Frida, you aren't saying....
I can't imagine Skald ever being young.
I was a beauty in my day, dearie. Don't act so surprised.
Did I ever tell you about the day when Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger?
Oh, he was young, and handsome. I had half a mind to go after him, myself, before I met my husband.
Go ahead and play your joke.
I'm ready for this party to be over.
I should be back in Windhelm. I've got work to do.
Did you know Vittoria is the Emperor's cousin? Best stay on her good side.
Just between us, I've got more important things to do than attend these meaningless parties.
Did you know Vittoria's getting married? They say the Emperor might even come to Skyrim for the wedding!
Gotta give the crowd a show.
What is this, you think you're clever?
All right, meat, it's time for you to earn your freedom.
If you want to fight your way out of here, you have to do it in the Pit.
Luckily there's no shortage of Pit bait around here. Now get in there and earn your freedom.
Hadvar? How do you know him?
But what's all this about? What are you two doing here?
Haven't you heard it by now?
He made the mistake of supporting the Stormcloaks, and it cost him. Bitter news for his family, but a fate they should've expected.
He must be here somewhere...
He wasn't protesting, Maven.
Haelga, I like you, so I'm only going to say this one time.
Of course he wasn't you stupid whore; he's a man. Now I'm not going to warn you again. Is that clear?
If you ever try and [QUOTE]practice the Dibellan arts[QUOTE] with Hemming again, I'll make sure that pretty little face loses its beauty.
Honest gold for honest work.
Honestly. Have you any idea?
Word of advice if you ride a Narwhale. Mind the pointy end.
Ah, but there I go, waxing poetic about my misspent youth. Now where were we? Ah yes. You're the mortal messenger. An I am...?
Oh, no no no! No mistake at all. What you made was a choice. Granted, not a very wise choice, but these things happen. Ah, the folly of youth...
You know, you remind me of myself at a young age. All I cared about was riding narwhales and sleeping in honeycombs and drinking babies' tears...
I got nothing to say to you.
I'm not looking for a conversation.
Pff. Go away, if you know what's good for you.
I have eternity to find you.
Hiding only prolongs your demise.
Impressive, you've mastered the shadows.
I hope you've got some coin.
I knew I could count on you.
I'm impressed at your even-handed treatment. Thank you.
I suppose that's true. Fine.
Why don't you have a chat with Legate Rikke?
I was hoping you'd say that.
And the outpost at Dragon Bridge?
It'll be shuttered by the end of the month.
Babette, my girl - pack your things. We're moving.
Well? I won't fight you, so we may as well get this over with.
But our work is just beginning. Approach me, Listener, and hear my words.
It is done. Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, and the Dark Brotherhood yet lives.
Oh... I see. Well then, let me be just say that it's been an honor serving under you Commander Maro.
Please, make haste. The Emperor's ship won't stayed moored forever. We won't get a chance like this again.
And, once more, I prove Commander Maro the fool. I told him you can't stop the Dark Brotherhood. Never could.
Very good. And you'll be returning to... Well, if you don't mind me asking, where exactly will you be going now, sir?
Don't you have all the information you need? Please, the Emperor isn't going to kill himself. Hmph. Now wouldn't that be a blessing...
Hmph. Now there's an excellent question. An excellent question, indeed. Truth is, as soon as the Emperor sets sail,  I'm resigning my position.
The honor has been mine. You should be proud of what we've accomplished here. The Dark Brotherhood is no more. And the Emperor, finally, is safe.
I wish you the best of luck.
He also has a fearsome control of Destruction magic.
We used to think the pirates had an army of battlemages at their side.
As it turns out, it was just one. Haldyn. I've since learned more about him.
The most dangerous sort of man -- quick to anger, but patient in exacting vengeance.
I would hope that's obvious.
Fail, and it won't matter anyway.
I watch you to make sure you are honorable.
Do well here, and you'll be a full member of the Companions.
If you are honorable and strong, then I can call you sister.
If you are honorable and strong, then I can call you brother.
I'd stay away if I were you.
I'll meet you at the shrine.
Don't you see? Fate has led you to me and to the pieces. Dagon has to answer our call. We're so close.
Ever since I was a boy, I felt this strange sense of destiny surrounding the Mythic Dawn cult, and now I know what it is.
I'll see you at our wedding!
Our wedding is soon. I'll see you then!
The wedding is soon. It'll be a good day.
An Amulet of Mara? You're not married? Surprising.
I'm looking forward to our wedding. You and me....
An Amulet of Mara, you're looking for marriage, then?
We have our wedding soon, don't we? That's right, we do!
Have you spoken to the Temple of Mara, yet? I'm so excited.
Our wedding is soon, under Mara's loving eyes. It'll be perfect.
You go ahead and arrange the wedding ceremony when you're ready.
You're wearing Mara's amulet? You? I'd marry you. I'd marry you twice.
Look at you. Wearing an Amulet of Mara. Are you saying you're available?
Now shouldn't you be off arranging our wedding day? Don't keep me waiting.
Is that an Amulet of Mara? I'm surprised someone like you isn't spoken for.
Never thought I'd get married under a Nord god. But with you, it feels right.
You've embarrassed the temple and spat in the face of love. What do you want?
You should arrange the ceremony at the Temple of Mara right away. I can't wait.
You should tell the priest we're getting married. They'll take things from there.
Is that Lady Mara's amulet? I'm shocked a fine person like you isn't married already.
You should speak to the priest in the Temple of Mara to arrange the ceremony. No sense waiting.
A person who is looking for a spouse simply wears an Amulet of Mara about the neck, showing they are available.
Hey, shouldn't you tell the Temple of Mara that we're getting married? Be hard to have a wedding without a priest.
That amulet. I've seen the Nords wear these when they're looking to marry. With your strength, you should have no trouble.
When another person shows interest, and the two agree to be together, one of them comes to the Temple and we arrange a ceremony.
Typically, love in Skyrim is as earnest as the people who live here. Life is hard, and short, so there is little room for long courtship.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
I... I've been trying to find the time and place to let her know.
I've been hurt worse before.
If you go to him, good luck.
Not for me to say. You'll have to talk to Kodlak Whitemane up in Jorrvaskr.
The old man's got a good sense for people. He can look in your eyes and tell your worth.
Is anyone out there? Anyone?
You, you there! Help me, I'm trapped.
Help! Can anyone hear me? I'm stuck down here.
Is everything well, Nelacar?
And there haven't been any... problems?
I see. Well, let me know if things get out of hand.
Oh yes, quite fine. My accommodations here continue to be just what I need.
Are you referring to your other customers? No, everything is quite all right. I expect a bit of animosity now and then.
It worked, then? Let me see!
Goodness, that's it, isn't it?!
I'll begin preparations. Thank you again so much for this.
Yes! It's not perfect, but it's a close enough approximation that it should certianly suffice for initial tests!
You've done excellent work here. Truly excellent. There's only one thing missing now, and that should be arriving shortly.
Let's just take a look then.
Like you won't do different?
I'm a cripple. I have a reason to be drinking.
Give us a coin, Cosnach. You'll just spend it on cheap ale, anyway.
And I'm a porter with no shipments coming in. You're not getting any coin from me, Degaine.
Mjoll! I'm glad I found you.
What is it, Drifa? What's the matter?
If I see him, I'll make sure he doesn't do anything brash. Don't worry.
It's Bersi. He's getting so angry about the corruption in Riften, he said he's going to walk right up to Maven and give her a piece of his mind.
No Mulush. I'll work harder.
I could smelt metal in half the time as you weak-willed pink-skins. Do I have to do everything?
No, not at all. It's just...
I have never doubted that, husband.
The people still doubt me, don't they.
Just guide them well, and all will work out.
It does not surprise me. They do not share in what I see, and I cannot explain it to them.
Now go, leave me to my work.
I should have expected as much. Fine, I shall give you 200 gold, and you shall leave me in peace.
Now, you just stand there...
Oh, good. I was afraid I'd have to go ask J'zargo.
Oh, good. I was afraid I'd have to rely on Onmund.
Thank you. I was afraid I'd have to figure out some way to do this on my own.
Oh, by the Divines, you too?
I've already told him. I don't have it!
Oh... well. Never mind then.
Aww. I thought you were done with it.
Oh. Well, you should probably go get it before someone steals it.
Well, you'd better go pick it up then, before someone snatches it.
Well what did you go dropping it for? Got my hopes up for nothin'...
Well... fine. I wasn't really gonna do anything with it anyway. Hmph.
Well... you probably should go collect it before someone else does, shouldn't you?
You dropped it by mistake? Well, if I was you, I'd go grab it now before somebody does.
Please. You first. I insist.
My friend! A toast to a beautiful friendship!
Stand back and watch a true professional wreck a party.
I just need to rest a moment, right here on this lovely rock.
Inside, my friend, inside! Where only the women and drinks are cold.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
The soldiers are some of our best customers, for we offer supplies and wares they cannot obtain by other means.
It was Ri'saad's idea to come here now, while the land is in turmoil. Where others saw only danger, he saw opportunity.
Skaggi is in charge, not me.
That it is. Good to be home. Let me know if you dig up any ore. We'll pay a fair wage.
That I do. If you want to grab a pickaxe and dig up some iron, feel free. I'll pay for anything you bring me.
Slow, but looking good, sir.
How's it coming there, Jawanan?
Slow's the only way to do it! Work too hard and you'll warp the wood.
So what do you want to know?
Only way you could have found one of those is by stealin' it. Guess you'll fit in around here better than I thought.
Some day, brother. Some day.
Nearly broke my back out in the mines today. Damn Nords should bleed for putting us through this!
Some layabout named Sabjorn.
Been a thorn in my side for the last few years now.
Speak to Styrr. He can help.
Good luck. I'm counting on you.
The courier must have found you.
You've returned! I'm hoping successfully.
You must be the one Falk spoke so highly of. Welcome.
I won't be able to relax until I'm sure Potema is dealt with.
Taking on Potema won't be easy. But you are the one to do it.
You know what needs to be done. Is there something more you need?
Sure it is, Lod. Sure it is.
Hey, Lod, how is the worst farmer in the hold doing?
The Gentle Repose is barren, it was barren the day my father claimed the land and it's barren now.
Sure, what can I do for you?
For a generous fellow traveler? But of course. What would you like to hear?
Sorry friend, but it looks like you're a bit light in the purse, and the wayward minstrel can't afford to do free performances.
Thank you for your kindness.
Thank you for the gold, traveler.
That's okay. We'll find a way to get by. Safe travels.
It's true about the dragons returning. Saw it with my own eyes.
Thank you, sir. Go right in.
Thank you, ma'am. Go right in.
Thanks for wasting my time.
That can't be a coincidence.
Are you... Are you sure? The staff is there?
That's the best I can offer.
I'm sorry, but that's as far as my generosity extends.
Well, I'm not blind to the fact that you've been instrumental in improving my affairs of the heart.
If you wish, you may enter my tower to view the museum section, but I'm afraid the laboratories are still off limits.
I've already provided you a key to the museum. You should consider it an honor. Few are allowed to browse my collection.
Then I have no work for you.
Then I was wrong about him.
Is that so? I've been wondering when he'd come around.
There it is. Ah.... Home....
Until then, here. This is for you, in thanks.
If you ever need the skills of a Khajiit warrior by your side, I would be honored to travel with you.
They were smaller back then.
This is just like old times.
We have to get the Key back.
Mercer's here. I can feel it.
By Talos, Mercer has a lot to answer for.
This place is coming down. Let's get out of here!
Let's get out of here before we end up like Mercer!
With any luck, this will be Mercer's final day alive.
Aye, there will be blood today. I can promise you that.
I can't wait to get my hands around that bastard's neck.
I'd just assume die before I'd let Mercer get those gems.
Do the Falmer also have no sense of smell? This place reeks!
Be careful, there's no telling what lurks within these walls.
If Mercer leaves here with the Eyes, we'll never see him again.
Crime is one thing, murder is another. Mercer will answer for this.
The Eyes would go a long way in helping get the Guild back on its feet.
This place, it's like a maze. How did the dwarves find their way around?
Keep as quiet as you can. The Falmer may be blind, but they can still hear us.
Ulfric will know my meaning.
Men who understand one another need not waste words.
There are but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe.
We've had the same troubles.
These are troubling times, indeed.
We must keep faith in ourselves and the Divines.
Between the dragons and the Stormcloaks, my coffers are running dry.
We've got our hands full dealing with the Stormcloaks. What about you?
Are the dragons frightening your people as much as they're frightening mine?
I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.
Have you found it difficult to get provisions lately? I can scarcely feed the staff in my palace.
With any luck, a worthy hero will step forward and solve our problems, just like in the tales of old.
Well done. Here's your gold.
Good work. A simple job, but it keeps the coin rolling in. Here's your share.
I'm sure that the owner of that place is relieved. They certainly came through with the coin.
Well then, consider it done.
Ah! An excellent suggestion. I'll do that one, then.
Mikael, son. How about something with a bit o' kick?
Alright, alright... Um... How about [QUOTE]The Guttersnipe[QUOTE]?
You trying to scare off my customers, son? Lively! Keep it lively!
You know, Hulda, there's this lovely Argonian ballad I've been studying...
So Mikael, what'll it be tonight, hmm? Something upbeat? A Breton jig maybe?
Well, that's not bad. But I was thinking [QUOTE]Mogo's Mead[QUOTE] really gets the place moving.
I think [QUOTE]Seven Septims for Sigurd[QUOTE] will do nicely. Especially when they're in their cups.
Hmm... Yes, you do raise a good point. What about the [QUOTE]Sweet Maidenfair from Hadleyshire[QUOTE]?
Well, I was thinking maybe something mournful. A High Elf dirge, perhaps? These are rather trying times, after all.
We've been down this road before, Mikael. Save the sap and sadness for your lady friends. My patrons need life! Cheeriness!
Well would you look at that!
I'm not sure. I certainly wasn't expecting this.
This appears to lead somewhere. Let's see where it goes.
Well, here we are. We think.
Well, I... If you're sure...
I'll just be on my way then. Please do be careful, and thank you.
Well, isn't this a surprise!
If I wanted to get yelled at, I'd be home. Can't you leave me be?
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I bothering you? Am I making your life more difficult?
How much of our money have you spent today, Ranmir? Anything left, or is it all gone?
Well, then. Repeat after me.
[QUOTE]Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor...[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor, Titus Mede II...[QUOTE]
Well, what news? Is Alain...
What are you hiding, priest?
That's enough, Thongvor. We're done.
I'm not hiding anything. It's closed for a reason.
You and the Jarl will answer for any desecration of my ancestors' bodies.
Typical Imperial lies. First you take away Talos, now you're keeping us from seeing our honored dead?
What should we have tonight?
Maybe. Let me think about it.
Stew again, papa? I want steak.
Something simple, a stew perhaps.
Maybe we could spend a little bit more and buy some meat, Endon.
What? The bo... Oh. Oh dear.
Help me get out of here, and I'll help you find them. Please!
I shouldn't have taken them, I know! It was stupid. I was stupid. It won't happen again.
Why can't I train with Aela?
It's just... I think our fighting styles are similar.
Well you can either get better with a bow or try to learn from me.
Because you wanted to learn the longer blades. Aela's never used anything bigger than a dagger.
Why did Boti send you to me?
Oh, my love. How I long to take her away from all of this.
Yes, youngling. Have a seat.
You control nothing, mortal!
You had your chance to talk!
Well. You must have all those annoying gods on your side to have made it this far, whoever you are. Even I have to admit, that's pretty impressive.
You'll never leave Markarth!
A risky game to play, friend.
But now Kematu's gone, and the rest of his snakes should slither back to their desert.
Ah, indeed I do! Indeed I do!
Ah. Some other time, perhaps?
All we can do now is rebuild.
So it seems the milk drinkers were right. That dragon was nearly the death of us.
Dead dragons... it hasn't moved since Ysgramor and it's not going to start now. Superstitious milk drinkers.
A bunch of lazy rabble trying to make a living. Can't get better workers in because everyone's afraid of the tomb up above the mine.
And now, to deliver a speech.
Stormblade. I want you to have my sword, a token of my appreciation.
Oh, and Legate. It's been an honor to have you at my side. As a token of my appreciation, I want you to keep my sword.
The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I wish to honor you, Dragonborn and the truest of Stormcloaks.
Now then. The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I wish to honor you, Dragonborn and the truest of Stormcloaks.
And they say romance is dead.
Oh yes. You've got to kill the bride. At her wedding.
Well, more like the public reception. It should be a lovely affair. You'll mingle with the guests, eat some cake... stab the bride.
And what did you say to that?
She can't tell me what to do!
There you go, son. Be your own man!
Papa, mama's making me do kitchen work again.
Are you the one sent by Mara?
As for what she might like...
You know, I took some classes at the Bards College as a youth. Poems come in handy when wooing.
I didn't tell you this. Faleen likes to act tough, but she really has a soft spot for, of all things, poetry.
There's a poem I once used on an older lady of Rorikstead. I can change it to be about Faleen, if you've got some gold.
By Sithis, you're not joking.
To kill the Emperor of Tamriel... The Dark Brotherhood hasn't done such a thing since the assassination of Pelagius.
As a matter of fact, no one has dared assassinate an Emperor of Tamriel since the murder of Uriel Septim, and that was two hundred years ago...
Come to gawk at the Dark Elf?
Well look at us. Like two gray specks in the snow.
I mean no offense. I am but a humble farmer. Not a... a great wanderer, like you.
Did Ri'saad accept our offer?
Was there anything else, or is our transaction complete?
Do you have Gallus's Journal?
Karliah? Then she's finally found it.
Dragonborn. What do you need?
I'm a Blade, now. I can hardly believe it.
By my honor, I pledge to rid Tamriel of dragons.
Gods, this is hers, isn't it?
She will certainly be missed.
Good. Perhaps I've misjudged.
Have you killed them all yet?
He made it safe for our kind.
An axe of great vengeance. Each fragment is precious.
Wuuthrad was the blade held by Ysgramor when he came back from Atmora.
Wuuthrad was the blade held by Ysgramor when he cut through the elven hordes that once swarmed this land.
Hey gossip, bring me a drink.
Bolund, you're going to die of thirst if you keep calling me that.
Hey, no fair! Get her, Stump!
How about... we play tag! You're it!
Oh yeah, and what would you rather do?
Wait, so... a costume? You're not serious...
Sure I am. We get some furs and tree branches, paint them white, and then tie them to Stump. Instant Frostbite Spider!
Frodnar... nobody is going to believe that your dog is a... Frostbite Spider. And if they do... they'll kill him. That's not much of a prank.
I am Uglarz, huntress of all.
The mine is rich, and so are we.
So now we're rich and now I'm chief.
But I am cursed, it would seem, to live alone.
I was lucky to get children out of the ones I did.
Mauhulakh. I remember him. Little, scrawny, fellow.
I'm going back to Narzulbur. Want to see how it's come.
If someone found her, she would make an excellent mate.
I've had several wives. But each dies sooner than the last.
Ha! Now that I would like to see. I may go back there some day.
Ha. Good luck to you, friend. She's not one who likes to be found.
It was my home. But I left. The woods felt more alive, at least for a time.
Always thought that old mine had more to it. Just like Mauhulakh to smash his way to good fortune.
I think of Uglarz. An old friend. When we were little she ran to the woods to hunt, and never came back.
Everyone said it had run out, but I smashed down one wall and found the widest veins of ebony I'd ever seen.
I can't believe I got caught.
Move along. Nothing to see here.
That could have turned out better.
Well, this is a nice mess you've gotten me into.
I can't wait to be invisible.
Come on. Hurry it up already. The waiting is killing me.
I gave them no such pleasure.
I'm not sure. At first they accused me of being a Stormcloak, a secret Talos worshipper...
I think they wanted to break me. Use me as a way to get to the rest of the Gray-Mane family.
They wanted a confession. To what didn't matter, they simply wanted me to admit to something.
I know, I know. I'm hurrying.
You... Dragonborn? Is it really true?
Yes, I'll be ready in a moment, I just need one more thing...
Come in, come in. Mustn't speak of these things in the Ratway.
Fine! I'll just... leave the rest of it. Let's go, then, if you're in such a hurry.
I thought she'd have realized it's hopeless by now. I tried to tell her, years ago...
I long to taste battle again.
I merely wish to talk to you.
I need some more ale, Orgnar.
Until then, I've no ale for you.
I'll find some coin for you. I always do.
You've had more than enough. Besides, you still haven't paid for the last one.
I think I know, but go ahead.
This place is getting worse and worse.
I tried to fence some goods to Tonilia, and you know what she told me?
She said that she barely had enough coin to cover it and I should come back later. Can you imagine that?
I will see you dead, monster.
I wish someone would find me.
But I'm lonely. Will you play with me?
