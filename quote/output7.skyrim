Then it got cold and dark. I'm not scared anymore.
Like I said. It got hot and smoky. Now it's cold and quiet.
The smoke woke me up. It was hot and I was scared, so I hid.
I'll begin searching up here.
It should be in a small bottle, very similar to a potion.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
As long as the College keeps paying, I'll keep digging.
Can't imagine what the College expects to find in here.
For thousand-year old ruins, they're not much to look at.
Gods, it's cold. They'd better find something good in there to make this worthwhile.
I'm so close to the answer...
May the Eight guide you to the Phial...
Please hurry -- I fear my master doesn't have much time left.
In fact, who are you, anyway?
You found... how in the world...
That's it. That's it! I don't know who you are, but you may have just saved this little project...
I don't know what sort of help you expect from me, but if you can actually find the crystal I'd certainly be grateful.
Indeed. If we ever get there.
Is it? This is disappointing.
J'zargo hoped there might be one who could keep pace with his accomplishments.
Is the new shaft cleared yet?
You're busy. I'll come back later.
No, I've been busy trying to keep the whole mine from collapsing, if that's all right with you.
It is? Well that's different.
Good work! Let's see what you got.
I tend to keep my patrons' privacy.
Very good... Let's see what you have here.
Or, you can just wait here. He'll be back soon enough.
He's in the inn. Look around. I'm sure you'll find him.
Interesting... They know more of our plans than I expected...
Hmm... They know more of our plans than I thought... Not good...
He was here, but he left. If you leave now, you can probably catch him.
One moment while I [QUOTE]correct[QUOTE] some of these documents... That should do it.
Give me a moment while I make a few, um, [QUOTE]corrections[QUOTE] to these reports... There we go.
It would seem Fort Dunstad is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those...
Oh, what's this? Fort Snowhawk is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those...
Make sure those forged documents get to the Legate in Morthal. They should give them the wrong idea... and us the advantage.
Make sure those forged documents get to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar. It'll throw him off our trail, allowing us to maneuver more freely.
It's about time you got here.
I'm not accustomed to dealing with people who are unreliable. That's why I asked Delvin to send me his best.
It's good to be mining again.
The mine is just how I remember it.
I never thought I'd see Kolskeggr again.
I've never seen Pavo so happy. It's good to be back in Kolskeggr.
Good to see you again, friend! We've opened the mine back up. If you're here for work, I'll buy any ore you have.
It's kind of an amusing tale.
I was making my way down the road from Ivarstead towards Riften, and I saw Vex fighting off a couple of wolves.
It's not much, but we get by.
Very little money passes through Winterhold anymore, but if there's one thing you can count on, it's folks needing a drink now and then.
Just one right now, actually.
I need you to eliminate an old woman named Agnis, a servant in Fort Greymoor.
Karliah... she's still alive?
I feared she'd befallen the same fate, ending up a victim of Mercer's betrayal.
Keep yourself safe, traveler.
Fortune to you and your children.
May the road favor the foolish...
Don't kid yourself... stone runs in our blood.
Darkwater Crossing is a difficult journey. Mind yourself.
I don't want to be responsible for sending you to your death. Be careful in the mine.
Like... with the little girl.
This is the Ring of Hircine. I was told it could let me control my transformations.
Perhaps it used to. But I'll never know. Hircine didn't care for my taking it, and threw a curse on it.
I put it on... and the changes just came to me. I could never guess when. It would be at the worst times.
My, my. What do we have here?
Farewell, Nightingale. See to it the Key stays this time, won't you?
Fear not. You'll have your trinkets, your desire for power, your hunger for wealth.
The Oath has been struck, the die has been cast and your fate awaits you in the Evergloam.
So... once again the Key has been stolen and a [QUOTE]champion[QUOTE] returns it to the Sepulcher.
I bid you to drink deeply from the Ebonmere, mortal. For this is where the Agent of Nocturnal is born.
Don't mistake my tone for displeasure, after all, you've obediently performed your duties to the letter.
But we both know this has little to do with honor and oaths and loyalty. It's about the reward; the prize.
It's been a number of years since I've set foot on your world. Or perhaps it's been moments. One tends to lose track.
What you fail to realize is your actions were expected and represent nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement.
Now that Ebonmere has been restored, you stand before me awaiting your accolades; a pat on your head... a kiss on your cheek.
Oh, half the field should do.
Uh... why don't we talk about this later?
Half the field? What could need half the field?
That should be all right. How much space were you planning?
I just think pollinating would be easier if I could do a lot of plants at once.
You know, I was thinking of expanding the herb garden. Make room for some new plants I'm planning.
Oh! Yes, but of course. Ahem.
The base broth is already boiled. We can get started right now. So... which ingredient should I add next?
The Emperor has requested your signature dish - the Potage le Magnifique. I've taken the liberty of getting it started.
But the cookbook only says so much, and everyone makes the Potage differently. I would be honored if we could make it... the Gourmet's special way.
Oh. Well, um, actually... you're not. Wearing a chef's hat, I mean. There's one right over there on the shelf. You can't very well cook without it...
Oh. Is it your... first time?
Inside the mind of Pelagius, silly.
Pathetic excuse for an elf...
Go. Your very presence sickens me.
Go now. Return to your pathetic pursuits.
Crawl back into whatever pit spawned you, Orc.
Be warned. You have been marked by the Thalmor.
Filthy Nord. In time, your entire race will be eradicated.
Slink away now, little Khajiit, with your tail between your legs.
The Justiciars know your face. And we elves have long memories...
Back to the swamp with you, Argonian. Lest I carve you into boots.
Now remove yourself from my presence, while you still draw breath.
You are a disgrace to the Altmer. I should kill you on general principle.
Flee from my sight, Dunmer, or I'll have you shipped back to Vvardenfell in a crate.
So I'm told. Try and keep up.
So I'm told. Let's see if you impress.
So they don't like us either.
Bad people who don't like werewolves.
A group of werewolf hunters who have gotten wise to our little secret.
They've made it their mission to hunt us down, but we are hunters ourselves.
So, has my bow turned up yet?
Who in the name of Azura are you?
I'm afraid we have little to offer you in the way of hospitality.
You look suspicious. You better not be one of those damn thieves.
You even think of taking something from my house... and I'll kill you.
You'll have to forgive my husband's manners. He's not used to pleasantries.
After we were robbed, Dravin's become more bitter than ever. He hates this place.
It's not safe around here. There's thieves out there looking to steal everything you own.
Thanks again for getting my bow back from those thieves. Next time they come knocking I'll be ready.
The war's been hard on the farm and hard on Dravin. We don't know what to expect from one day to the next.
Someday, I hope we can get away from here... perhaps move back to Morrowind. This isn't at all what we expected.
Now that you've brought Dravin's bow back, he's back to his crabby old self. For better or for worse, I still thank you.
Sometimes cargo goes missing.
We work where we can get work. The Nords don't like unloading their ships, so we do it instead.
Sound like you can handle it?
Yeah. Someone ticked off Maven and she wants to teach them a lesson... our way. You in?
Got a good one here. Personal score to settle between myself and this mark. You up for it?
This one angered someone pretty high up in the keep. Can I count on you to get this done for me?
Brynjolf finally got some dirt on the mark and the evidence to back it up. Think you can give him a hand?
This one should be easy. Get in, plant the goods and get out. Quiet and neat. Sound like your kind of job?
Sure, sure. Got one that should be pretty easy, as long as you keep your weapon sheathed. Can you handle it?
Got another personal score to settle and I'd consider it a favor if you'd take the job. Think you can help me out?
Someone wants to see this mark suffer. They're paying a good bit of coin to have us plant the evidence in their house. You in?
The mark must have ticked-off our client badly. He's impatient and keeps asking if the job's done. Can you get him off my back?
We send you to plant some phony evidence in the mark's house, and then tip off the town guard... the rest takes care of itself.
When a client needs us to eliminate another, we don't operate like the Dark Brotherhood. We find alternate means to get them out of the way.
Strangers are always trouble.
I don't need to talk to you. Get lost.
Don't talk to me. You could be one of them.
I run the mill, so I'm a busy woman. What is it?
A good lumberjack is quiet, hard-working, and honest.
Aeri's the boss. Should talk to her if you want work.
I used to work at Anga's Mill, but I... I had to leave.
Someone's after me I tell you. They're watching me. Somewhere.
I work at the mill. Chop trees, carry logs, saw lumber, you know.
Always something going wrong. Mill needs more lumber or the saw needs sharpening.
Take this with our gratitude.
Rise from your graves to defeat this worm!
Thank you for releasing us from her spell.
I shall have vengeance for the death of my husband. Rise!
Now we can rest in peace once again. Come Fjori, my love...
True, but I'm not going to be the one to try to oppose her...
I think it's sweet Lu'ah is so worked up over her dead soldier...
You will not stop me from killing those who wage this pointless war!
I could not raise him, but I will raise an army to avenge his defilement!
They burned his body before I could raise him... it should have been returned to me...
Yeah, but raising Draugr to take on both the Imperials and the Stormcloaks? That's just crazy.
I am Lu'ah Al-Skaven. Who are you to disrupt my work? Begone, or I will add you to my army of the dead!
Keep digging! Ugh... If Lu'ah Al-Skaven can raise an army of Draugr, then why do I have to babysit them?
Teach them to stop paying me.
Here. You deserve a reward for your service.
Thank you for sticking by me.
I'll, uh, just take that as a compliment.
It's good to hear you say that. I wish my wife was as simple as you.
Where else would I go? Dawnstar is my home and working here is my job.
That is none of your concern.
Taking this man to be interrogated.
That should do it. After you.
There's two more of them ahead.
This one doesn't look too difficult.
Karliah's close, I'm certain of it. Now let's get moving.
Karliah's been through here. What does she expect to find?
We're on the right track. She's been through here as well.
Ah, it's one of the infamous Nordic puzzle doors. How quaint.
That door up ahead... looks perfect for hiding an ambush. Be ready.
The stench in here... this place smells of death. Be on your guard.
They say that these ancient Nordic burial mounds are sometimes impenetrable.
Bone chimes... clever. Rigged to wake the draugr I'd bet. Don't blunder into any of them.
Fortunately, these doors have a weakness if you know how to exploit it. Quite simple, really.
Karliah always was a nimble minx... slipping passed these draugr must be child's play for her.
Pull the chain over there, and watch out for the spikes. Looks like Karliah reset all of the traps.
Quite simple really, I don't know what the fuss is about these locks. All it takes is a bit of know-how and a lot of skill.
Without the matching claw, they're normally impossible to open. And since I'm certain Karliah already did away with it, we're on our own.
Then what are you doing here?
No? So you don't know anything about my brother?
There is no news, I'm afraid.
Yes, that will be fine. Thank you.
None? Nothing at all? Nothing from the College, even?
I shall inform you the moment something noteworthy happens.
So, what's the latest exciting news about goings-on in Winterhold?
Watch that tongue, new blood.
We won't return empty handed.
The scent of victory is on the wind.
It will be a good day. I can feel it in my gut.
There will be a feast in our honor when we return.
We're going to make them pay.
Those bastards will regret raising their weapons against Jorrvaskr.
Let's get back to Jorrvaskr. We'll want to pay our respects to Kodlak's spirit.
We've got to get out of here.
You didn't have to help me, so... thanks.
I saw guards dragging bodies over here. Might be a way out.
You saved my life. I won't forget it. Look me up if you're ever in Riften.
Well, I guess you'll have to.
What are you doing down here?
Hey, you're not supposed to be down here. Official business only.
What's that supposed to mean?
What's this nonsense I've been hearing? How dare you call Bolli a deadbeat!
If he paid what he owes, I wouldn't have to say anything. Besides, what in Oblivion do you care?
Oh come off it, Niv. We both know you married that fisherman for his gold. You don't need to put on an act for my benefit.
When you get it, she's yours.
Didn't think you had the coin.
When you got that much, we'll talk.
That would work, except you ain't got.
That'll do. She's all saddled up for you.
Then come back when you've got that much.
I'd sell her for that, but you ain't got it.
Sold. She's all yours. She's already saddled up.
Wish everyone haggled like you. She's all yours.
You've got a deal. It's the one with the saddle.
Good enough for me. It's the one with the saddle.
Looks like you're a little short on coin though. Sorry.
That much? I mean, of course. If that's all you've got.
Sounds fair. She's yours. Like I said, she's all saddled.
Wow! Didn't think I could get that for her. I mean, sure!
If you had it, you'd be riding and we wouldn't be talking.
That would be a fair price. When you've got it, come see me.
Too bad you don't have that much. Guess you'll have to walk.
Fair enough. You can have her. She's the one with the saddle.
That's your best offer? I suppose so. She's the one with the saddle.
Yes, but it's no easy matter.
But you don't need to share the worries of an old warrior. This day is to rejoice in your bravery!
You dare to betray us, Illia?
Our sisterhood will be better off with you dead, brat.
You have? Where? Tell me now!
You visit us often, Thadgeir.
Most of my friends are buried here.
You want a fight? You got it.
Easy. Here. These are the keys. The hilt is in a chest in my house, just don't hurt anyone.
You're smarter than you look.
You've been warned, outsider.
You. I've seen you snooping around. Asking questions.
Back off. You don't want to know what happens to troublemakers here.
[QUOTE]Sir[QUOTE]? How quaint.
A traitor right up to the end.
I've been waiting for Roggvir's execution. Talk to me later.
And killed them. In his honor.
What? Who is the Night Mother?
Oh! Oh, you jest! You jest with gullible Cicero!
You of course know that the Night Mother is our Unholy Matron. The undying spirit of a great woman who birthed the children of Sithis.
And what makes you think that?
Because war is good for business, of course.
The war? That is not a reason to leave, it is a reason to stay.
That may be, but what of the war? That is not so easy to escape from.
I admit, the dragons are a concern, but we can avoid them if we do not stay in one place for too long.
Between the war and the return of the dragons, I wonder if we should not leave Skyrim and ply our trade elsewhere.
Another day in this graveyard.
Falkreath is a fine place to be, Bolund.
Falkreath is where people go to die. We could be fighting, taking back Nord land!
Falkreath is our home, a place where we have good jobs under a good Jarl. Until the war comes to us we stay put.
Another new Apprentice, I see.
I assure you that I shall be watching you -- all of you -- very closely.
Are you of the sort that believe you're here to change the world? Or are you only in it for yourself?
Anything else you want to say?
Finally, someone around here that can get things done.
Since we're short on soldiers you'll be coming with us, too. No arguments.
Anything for my favorite lass.
Debts are debts. Either he pays them, or his kind do.
Who are you to say what I should do? I'll pay her back when I'm ready.
Oh? Were you after her yourself? I won't stand in your way, my friend. You have my word.
I guess if you're telling me to stop worrying about it, maybe I should just let it go. Thank you, friend.
Carlotta put you up to this, didn't she? I'm sorry, but that fiery widow is mine. She just doesn't know it yet.
Those boots aren't worth the septims I do pay them. I'm not giving them coin I could give to good, Nord workers.
Well, my friend, if you think those boots needs more coin, I'll make it happen. But I'm doing this for you, not them.
What do you think I am, a beggar? My family has always paid back every single coin we owed, going back to Tiber Septim's time.
What? Are you telling me how to treat my workers? Do you have any idea how much metal the Silver-Blood family wants us to smelt?
Avulstein... you stupid boy...
So he might still be in there?
What is my freedom worth, if the price is my brother's life?
A wise decision, but I fear he may not be safe there anymore.
They'll go looking for me, and Whiterun will be the first place they search.
I don't dare go back in now. I'll just have to hope that in the confusion he can slip out.
Aye, you've got a point there.
Passing on a golden opportunity is worse.
Better in here than out there.
I've got your back, don't worry.
Look around. Grab anything useful.
Biggest damn spiders I've ever seen.
We've got to find a way out of here.
This is the longest day I can remember.
The others'll have to find another way out.
I don't think this day is ever going to end.
Here's the noble Empire in all its glory. Pah.
I sure hope there's a way out somewhere down here.
We'd better get moving before any more Imperials show up.
Take it slow and careful, and I think we can sneak by her.
We must be near the entrance for that bear to make its den here.
Let's see where this goes. Better than going back outside with that dragon.
Get yourself a weapon. I'm going to need your help if we run into any more Imperials.
But that day has not come yet.
If it's the war you're referring to, I'm on the side of Whiterun.
The day might come when I am forced to draw my sword for one side or the other.
No doubt General Tullius and his friends in the Empire will tell you that I owe them my loyalty, and perhaps I do.
Ulfric Stormcloak would say that I owe my allegiance to the Nord people as they fight for Skyrim's independence. Perhaps this is also true.
By the gods! Somebody help me!
Why are you here? Get away from me!
Come on, Beem-Ja. We're going.
Not without us, you aren't! I'm sure there's enough for everyone, after all.
Did you clean the linens, yet?
I did. Those mead stains are always tricky.
Don't leave any of them alive.
The Silver Hand. They finally had the nerve to attack Jorrvaskr. We got most of them, but I think a few stragglers made it out.
Enough games, face your death!
You can't hide from the hidden.
Your presence will be revealed.
Excellent. Show them no mercy.
Good. Do not spare them your blade.
I knew you could be counted on. Do what must be done.
Feels good to be mining again.
How can you say that? This mine was filled with draugr not too long ago.
Finally, we have an agreement.
I look forward to having it back soon. The sooner, the better, in fact.
Fool! None may know my secret!
Good luck with that Icewraith.
Good man. You won't regret it.
Ah, you're a smart woman. That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
Good. And his Writ of Passage?
You performed your duties to the letter.
Oh wait, let me guess - you don't have them.
You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. Splendid, splendid...
Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage too, I see, so that's done.
Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage, too, I see. So there's that.
Ah, and word has come in from Markarth that the keep's cook has met an untimely demise.
Right, which we had already established. And you managed to hide the body as well? Good.
Back to Markarth with you! Virane must be silenced! He's a potential witness, you witless dagger jabber!
Well, looks like you completed the contract as directed. Finally. A little sloppy, but, well... done is done.
I've also received word from Markarth. It would seem Anton Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good.
You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. So there's that. And Anton Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good.
Bah! Useless. Here's your gold. Now go see Astrid. The time to move against the Emperor has finally come. Sithis help us all.
So I gathered. It seems a certain Orc has disappeared. Which means you not only killed the Gourmet, but disposed of the body as well.
But why? Why, pray tell, have I received word that Anton Virane is still walking around Markarth, hale and healthy as the day he was born?
Fool! Amateur! Without those papers you'll never be able to present yourself as the Gourmet! Off with you! Back to the body to retrieve them!
Here's your gold, with a little extra for hiding the body. Now go see Astrid. The final stage of the contract has come. The Emperor must fall.
But unfortunately, that inn is abuzz with the news of somebody killing one of their guests! What, hiding the body was too much for you to handle?
Ha! You can't resist, can you?
It is especially potent against the undead, and should burn them to a crisp in no time.
Let's see... this one, I think. J'zargo has designed it to be an excellent flame cloak, with a twist.
J'zargo gives you plenty of these scrolls, so you try them and return when you can say whether they work.
Have you reconsidered my idea?
Have you lost all sense? We are short on guards as it is!
The answer is no, I tell you! Now stop pestering me with your war-mongering!
The Companions can help protect the city, and the Emperor will be in our debt.
I haven't changed my mind, if that's what you're asking. I won't leave Whiterun defenseless, even for a day.
If we send half our guards to aid the legions, just for a few days, it could tip the scales in the Empire's favor.
If we lose half our men, the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves' Guild will have the run of the city. The Stormcloaks will be the least of our worries!
Haven't heard from him since.
Somewhere up north, in the ice fields.
Said he found some old Dwemer artifact, but... well, that was years ago.
He might not devour you whole.
You really want to help? You go offer yourself at Malacath's Shrine. Petition him for help.
Perhaps... Perhaps it might. If nothing else, you could be an excellent sacrifice to Malacath.
Here you go, for your trouble.
Took your sweet time getting it to me.
Here, a reward from your Jarl.
You've shown those monsters that they will no longer be tolerated in the Pale. Good work.
Here's your gold, as promised.
Our master craftsman are nothing compared to the perfection of the Daedra. Look at how it shines.
Hey, you don't look so good...
You know, you're a fun person to drink with. I know this great little place where the wine flows like water. We should head there.
Hey... is someone watching me?
I swear, if I'm being followed...
I swear I feel like I'm being watched.
If this keeps up, I'm headed back to the Winking Skeever.
I don't have time to chase shadows, I've got better things to do.
Hi, Marise. How are you today?
Shadr, that's so sweet... I'd love to.
I'm well. How are things over at the stables? Old Hofgrir giving you a hard time?
Naw... he's fine. Look, I wanted to ask if you'll... um, if you'd like to... well, like to have a drink with me at the Bee and Barb sometime?
Hmph. That remains to be seen.
How have things been with you?
Thank you, miss, I appreciate that.
I got another harangue from Torsten yesterday.
Don't worry about him. I know you work hard, and I'm the one who gets you your money.
I am not your plaything, worm!
I am waiting for a good death.
If you are not here to grant me a good death, then you can leave.
I bet she'll talk to you, too.
In the basement. Trust me, you'll see it.
I don't care, a deal's a deal.
Tell Shadr he doesn't owe me anything.
All right, all right. I guess I made enough from his shipment. No need to waste any more time threatening a stable hand.
I don't want to talk about it.
You don't want to talk about it, or you don't know?
What is this feud you have with your wife? What started this?
If you don't mind me saying, Leigelf. You're working too hard. Go home.
Never. Not until we turn this mine around, drive Beitild out of business, and force her to apologize to me for everything she's done!
I hope we reach Markarth soon.
I can't wait to learn from the priestesses.
How could they live like this? It's disgusting.
Let's find Fjotra. This place gives me the creeps.
I swear, if those things have laid a hand on her...
Let's get to the Forsworn camp. Her life could be in danger.
Please, let's hurry to the Temple before the Forsworn find me again.
I hope Fjotra is happy in the temple. We're so honored to have given her.
Thank you for getting her back from the Forsworn. Dibella was smart to have sent you.
I'm sorry, the Temple of Dibella is closed. You can receive your blessing, if you wish, but the other sisters are in seclusion.
I knew it! Let me see, please!
I knew he wasn't gone, I just knew it!
Please, get that to Avulstein right away.
The Thalmor? By the Nine, it's worse than I thought.
So... Northwatch Keep. Then we know where to hit them.
Well, where is it? Forgive me, but I don't dare just trust your word, no matter who you are.
I thank you for your courtesy.
This person, whomever he or she may be, must be punished for their treachery.
You will kill me, and I have accepted that fate. But regardless of your path through life, I sense in you a certain... ambition.
Once you have been rewarded for my assassination, I want you to kill the very person who ordered it. Would you do me this kindness?
So I ask of you a favor. An old man's dying wish. While there are many who would see me dead, there is one who set the machine in motion.
I'll mark it down on your map.
A sword? I remember a legend that Tiber Septim had attacked one of the enemy camps before he came to Old Hroldan. It could be there.
I'll meet you outside of town.
Go on, then. Deliver my message to Sibbi.
Hey, don't you want to make this exchange?
I may not be fond of Letrush, but even I've got to admit he's got the upper hand.
I'm being as careful as I can.
Careful. You spill one drop of silver, I'm taking it out of your hide.
Did you just talk back to me? I'm not paid to listen. I'm paid to keep you working. Now work.
I'm sorry, but I really can't.
It seems those tales are true.
No doubt those Greybeards up at High Hrothgar will talk your ear off about it.
The old tales tell of Dragonborn heroes who slew dragons and took their power.
Wulfharth was Dragonborn. Talos, too - the founder of the Empire, back in the good old days.
It means you can kill dragons and steal their power - even speak with a dragon's voice, they say.
It means you have the Dragon Blood - you have an inborn ability to use your Voice the way dragons do.
With the dragons returning, and now a Dragonborn appearing... maybe the Greybeards know what it all means.
They say the Emperors used to be Dragonborn, but that all ended when Martin died during the Oblivion Crisis.
Well, in the old tales, the Dragonborn heroes would use the power of their Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim.
I don't know much. Only the old tales about the ancient heroes who would use the Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim.
The Greybeards can tell you much more than I can. They're the masters of the Way of the Voice and taught Tiber Septim himself.
There hasn't been a Dragonborn seen in the land for centuries. Not since Talos himself walked the 7,000 Steps to High Hrothgar.
The only thing I remember is the old story of Tiber Septim being called Dragonborn by the Nords, before they switched sides and joined the Empire.
It's the waiting that gets me.
I don't like the look of this place.
You must be the new recruit. Welcome to the Legion.
At least we got the damn crown. I hope it was worth it.
I keep thinking I see something moving in the shadows...
I don't know what we're doing here, but orders are orders.
I hope we don't run into anything worse than Stormcloaks in here.
Nobody allowed in. Ulfric Stormcloak's orders. Consider yourself warned.
I wish the Legate would let us clear out of here. Place gives me the creeps.
Let me know when you're ready.
Good idea. Let me know when you're ready.
Let me put it to you this way.
Nothing happens in Riften without Maven's consent. One word from her and you could spend the rest of the fourth era in prison.
Let's just not be too obvious.
Are you prepared for tonight's hunt?
You know the old man doesn't like it.
There's nothing wrong with what we're doing.
I've been thinking we need to be more... discreet.
Let's test that out some time.
Aren't they slow? I can get in and out before you have one swing.
What kind of weapon do you prefer? I like the smaller, quicker blades.
Yes, you're very fond of saying that. You know I like hammers and axes.
Looks like you had no trouble.
Hey! What're you doing in here?
That's it! You're leaving, right now.
Get out of here or I'll call the guards!
You should see me when you get bored, stranger.
Look along the east coast. The boat will be there.
Everyone needs work, right? I have good work for you.
I've got a little work if you're interested, traveler.
You look new. I'm new, too. I think we could be friends.
Get moving. I'll see if I can't delay any patrols out there.
I'm not interested, Jaree. It doesn't matter how many times you ask.
It would be best if we spoke little until you've completed your task.
If you're looking for opportunities to make some coin, well... I'm your man.
I believe you know what needs to be done. Something about putting out a fire?
You might want to rethink that. You're missing out on some wonderful opportunities, working in that bar.
Maybe it would. If you had it.
Big talk for someone with a light purse.
You know what? I think I do know the guy you're talking about.
Well... when you put it that way, I think I do know the old guy you're talking about.
Maybe it's time you quit then.
Don't let it get you down. Indaryn will eventually tire of picking on you and move on to someone else.
I can't take it anymore, Tythis. Indaryn keeps pushing me around and I'm not even doing anything wrong.
And do what? Losing a job from the Black-Briar family would make me a marked man. No one would ever take me on anywhere else.
Maybe one day, just not today.
Morvath will taste your blood!
No, and I'm not expecting any.
Still no word from your family?
My family didn't really approve of me coming here at all.
Oh. Well, that's... awkward. Sorry to have brought it up.
Really? That must be so nice. I came all the way to Skyrim just to get away from my family's expectations.
Oh come on, I ain't that dumb.
But I can't leave here! I'm supposed to watch his house. What do I do?
Oh, this is going to be great!
Then just confront Haelga with them and the rest works itself out.
You need to get the Marks of Dibella from Bolli, Hofgrir and Indaryn. Not sure how you're going to do that, but try your best.
One down, my friend. One down.
Pay your dues and we'll speak.
I'll serve you after you've paid Vex.
Hmph. I don't talk with Guild traitors.
Come back when you're in the Guild's good graces.
Speak to Vex. We have nothing else to talk about.
Settle your accounts with Vex, and then we can talk.
That means your out. No jobs, no payouts... no nothing.
You're in it deep... better start shoveling your way out.
Until you're done with Vex, we don't have anything to discuss.
Sorry. We got nothin' to talk about. Vex will straighten you out.
Straighten yourself out with the Guild and then maybe we can talk.
I may be new around here, but at least I know how to follow the rules.
Sorry, I'm not buying any goods until you straighten this out with Vex.
It's a shame you got booted from the Guild... things were going so well.
Don't want to know what you did and I don't care. Just keep away from me.
I'm surprised you're even showing your face around here after what you did.
Until you get back into the Guild's graces, we have nothing to speak about.
You've done it now, whelp. You broke the rules and now you're knee deep in it.
Go talk to Vex. She'll tell you the why's and how's if you want to get back in.
You better straighten things with the Guild or you won't be welcome here anymore.
You want my advice? Pay your debt to Vex quickly and she'll forget the whole thing.
You want to get back into our graces, you need to talk to Vex. She'll set you straight.
Speak to Vex to make the proper reparations if you want back in. Now get out of my sight.
The Guild will not tolerate the kind of behavior you've been displaying. Too much is at stake.
Are you crazy? What were you thinkin'? You can't just go around doin' things the way you please!
Now we have to kick you out until things cool down. Can't give you any jobs or payouts for goods.
I'm taking you out of the game for now. No jobs will be offered and you won't be able to fence your goods.
Seems no one in this city has.
Suit yourself. Get 'em Hewnon!
Thank the Divines! Let's move!
Thank you. The Eight keep you.
The new meat. So soft. Tender.
What was it like killing your first one, huh?
The shadows have betrayed you!
Come mortal, let's end this here and now!
The games have ended, time to face your death!
They are good, loyal children.
Once she's with child, I will not harm her.
If he does show up with a bride, we'll have to move quickly.
They squander their father's love. We can't dally this time.
Yes, you've made that quite clear in the past. And now we have Urog and Dushnamub because of your weakness.
This was your crazy idea, huh?
You better know what you're doing.
My men are ready. Now it's up to you.
Let's do this. Summon this dragon of yours.
Lure it into the trap! I'm counting on you!
Come, my men stand ready on the great porch.
Get it into the trap before it kills us all!
I don't know how you talked the Jarl into this.
Do whatever you're going to do before it kills us all!
Tomorrow. Same time as before.
[QUOTE]Forgiveness is the heart of Mara's blessings.[QUOTE] Very well. We shall re-arrange your wedding.
Well I think your betrothed might feel otherwise. The two of you will need to work this out before the temple will marry you.
Wait... who are you? Intruder!
The Emissary? What's this about?
Why didn't you say so? Take over my post. Make sure nobody enters the Solar.
Well aren't you a strange one.
What is that supposed to mean?
How is your hunting with Yatul?
We are strong. We get the job done.
Well someone has to provide around here.
I'm proud of you for helping provide for us.
What?  My Fjola would never...
What? Well - what did she say?
Whatever I don't already know.
Power is the crux of this world. There's always more of it to be had, if you look in the right places.
Who could tell the difference?
Well we have to harvest somewhere! This is getting absurd.
I want to make money just as much as you do, but we don't want to make the Nords angry.
That last brigade of soldiers said there's a tall forest on the eastern edge of the White River.
Yes, but that's too close to Mixwater Mill. We don't want to get Gilfre angry at us by stealing her trees.
Who were you fighting against?
Did you ever have to fight off bandits, Frida? Like in your stories?
Dawnstar has always held its own against the bandits and wild animals of the Pale.
Oh, dearie, it was so long ago. But I do remember the celebration we had afterwards. Mead never tasted so good.
Why, I once fought alongside your father when we were both younger. Saved him from getting his fool head sliced off.
Yeah, you said that yesterday.
Rest up, scum. Probably getting executed tomorrow.
Guess the headsman's been busy with all your friends. Ha ha ha ha ha!
Come now. You'll want to show up in Sovngarde refreshed. You got an eternity of merrimakin' ahead of you.
Yes, the staff. Interesting...
You appear ready for the Oath.
I'm just as puzzled as you, lad.
I'm just as puzzled as you, lass.
We'll speak when the Oath is complete.
It's just ahead. Please, keep following.
This is enough to make your head spin, eh?
Not now, lad. Karliah said it was important.
Not now, lass. Karliah said it was important.
I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.
I'm preparing to leave for the standing stone. What is it?
I think we can trust Karliah. Let's see what she's on about.
I have some preparations of my own to make. I'll meet you at the stone.
You appear hesitant to don your Nightingale Armor. What's troubling you?
Time's wasting and Mercer's still out there. Let's get this show on the road.
I promise you, all your questions will be answered. You just have to trust me.
I suggest you talk to Karliah first. She has some news that'll turn your stomach.
You have an Elder Scroll? You?
Wait. Are you... Are you serious?
You have heard of the Gourmet?
I'm collecting ingredients to bring to the Gourmet. He'll think my tastes so refined when I offer them to him.
You have the gold yet or what?
I believe you owe the Guild something.
I hope you come up with that gold soon.
You have your orders, soldier.
I thought I gave you something to do?
You'll have to catch me first!
Ah, Olfina. How may I help you?
Glad to see you're making new friends. I know Jon's death was hard on you.
Got any sausages? I'm cooking a special breakfast for a friend, and they're his favorite.
Best you forget whatever you think you saw, elf. Such idle talk can prove hazardous to one's health.
Would your good friend be named Jon, by any chance? I've spied the two of you talking quite intimately.
Ah, that is good to hear, then.
Ah, yes. True. Well, thank you.
Your schedule is always clear, Arch-Mage. I see to that.
Mirabelle, would you please make sure my schedule is clear for the next few days? I'm working on something important.
All right. Let's take a look...
Thank you, soldier. Let's take a look at these reports...
Is that so? Lost your uniform along the way did you, soldier?
Why don't you grab yourself a drink at the Windpeak before heading back?
Why don't you have yourself a drink at the Moorside before you head back?
Is that so? I don't recognize you. Why aren't you wearing your Stormcloak colors?
It's not easy running messages, what with Imperials scouts crawling all over the place. Well done.
Stormcloak scouts are making it difficult to move around. It's good you made it here in one piece.
Ah, good. Looks like the reinforcements for the fort are on the way. And we have some information about enemy troop movements as well. Excellent.
I'm waiting on word about reinforcements for the fort... Good, they're on the way. And we have some information on enemy troop movements. Excellent.
And there is... no... Listener!
She... spoke to you? More treachery! More trickery and deceit! You lie! The Night Mother speaks only to the Listener!
Arkay keep you and protect you.
Because Ulfric needed a symbol.
Someone he could defeat that represented the Empire, the White-Gold Concordat, the banning of Talos worship.
Torygg's father Istlod had held Skyrim together for nearly twenty-five years. When he died, Torygg became that symbol.
Brilliant, I know. It's a gift.
Hmm... All right... How about this?
Shadows creep, and... and phantoms leap! A man got... he got scared. And the demons dared! To um... visit upon him all which they feared!
But we choose our own path now.
And a whole lot of good that's gotten us.
I'll never understand why you're so bitter about everything.
I'm bitter because we had lives in Cyrodiil. And we came out here to be paupers.
Consider the suspension lifted.
Yes. I hope this will be enough to maintain order.
Oh, excellent. I'll see that it gets where it needs to go.
Once again, your suspension is lifted. Please try and control yourself.
Very good. I'll see that this is put towards getting things back to normal.
You don't seem to have the gold on you. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding?
And I'll make sure the suspension is lifted. I'm glad we were able to clear this matter up, and I do hope we don't need to have this talk again.
Don't say words you don't mean.
You have strong arms. You'd make a good Orc.
Um... thank you, Lash. You'd... make a fine Nord?
Don't worry. I'll play my part.
I find these parties such a dreadful bore.
One thing everyone can agree on. This war is bad for business.
Falk said I could count on you.
Speak to Falk when you have the funds. And thank you.
You have more than earned the right to purchase property and take the next step to becoming a Thane.
First, you must open this door.
I'd much rather it be in the hands of an ambitious and talented person such as yourself.
A piece of my power has been locked away behind it, and even my eyes cannot see past the seals.
Ha ha ha ha! No! Never find me!
Inkpot. Stone. Bucket. Book. Knife.
Buying and selling fine jewelry here!
Buy some armor and live to tell about it!
Looking to stay alive? Why take a chance?
Vegetables as crisp as a winter's morning!
Jewelry with legendary Argonian craftsmanship!
Bucket. Knife. Book. Inkpot. Stone. No, no, no.
Knife. Yes. Book. Yes. Bucket. Yes. Inkpot? No.
Protect yourself right... buy armor from Grelka.
All meats guaranteed clean and free from Rockjoint!
Beautiful baubles and gleaming gemstones over here!
Gems, potions, exotic ingredients... I have them all!
Rare trinkets and the finest oddities from Morrowind!
The fairest prices and the highest quality in Skyrim!
Fresh meats and produce! Get them before they're gone!
Have you spoken to Fastred yet?
Perhaps one day, but not today.
Klimmek is doing just fine. You should follow your heart.
No. I'll tell you, Wilhelm, if I could sweep her away from here tomorrow I'd do it, but Klimmek still has so much to learn.
Here's the gold for it. Thanks.
Ah, good. I've been waiting on that.
Here's your share. Nicely done.
Give it to me quickly, before they see us together. You've riled up the priestesses, and the guards don't take kindly to that.
Hey! Those belong to my family!
No! Aunt Agna! Talos, why didn't I go in with her?
I'll return my ancestors to Sovngarde, and you with them!
The dead should be made to serve the living, not the other way around!
Sigh... fine, take whatever you want, so long as you help me get rid of Vals.
Ah! Oh, by Kyne you startled me. There's a necromancer around here so watch yourself.
Sovngarde is a myth, you s'wit! And now you can join your ancestors in service to me!
This looks like the area Agna told me about. She said that the bear would show the way...
He's barred the door. Gods only know how he's... defiling the bodies of my ancestors in there!
Careful, there's a pressure plate around here. I've triggered it before and got pelted with darts.
You found it! The passage goes through the sarcophagus... I don't like this... but we'd better keep going.
Okay, I think this door should lead to the main burial chamber where Vals is holed up. Let's get in there and put and end to this.
Agna once told me there is a secret room deeper in where they buried disgraced members of the family. Maybe that will get us into the main chamber...
Hmph. Damn you for being right.
Oho! Manservant? Is that what I am now?
Old man, without me, you would have withered away a long time ago.
Well if my layabout manservant fed me more, that wouldn't be a problem.
There's a chill in the air. Ysmir's beard, it gets colder in here every day.
That's just you getting skinnier every day, old man. You're losing your padding. You need to eat more.
My mistake. A manservant wouldn't let me starve or freeze. I let you live here, and now I'm two steps closer to the grave.
I can't think of anyone better.
And now they know Mercer never genuinely cared about the Guild. He lacked the loyalty you obviously possess.
Look. Everyone in the Guild admires what you've done. Maybe they won't come out and simply tell you, but I promise you it's true.
I count my blessings every day.
I don't buy that story, either.
Too bad. That one's my favorite.
How did you manage to cripple yourself, Degaine?
Mining accident, back when I was in prison for being a pickpocket.
You're lying. You're not quick enough to be a pickpocket. What's the real reason?
Fell off the top of the cliff after a drunken party with the priestesses of Dibella.
I don't know. He never told me.
If I'd known it was so important to him, I'd have charged him more.
He made most of the arrangements himself, he just needed it transported from Morrowind. That's what I agreed to help with.
I don't need luck, I need rest.
I haven't even said what it is.
No, I don't think so. Not today.
Doesn't really matter. Thanks, but no.
Malur, I need you to take care of something.
I hope you've readied yourself.
I long to fight that foul worm.
Shall Alduin remain so long unchallenged?
Let us not spurn our lord's bounty - this hall is his gift, for glory well-earned.
Ease your heart, our honor is unstained - it's by Shor's command we curb our onslaught.
It is by Shor's command that we curb our wrath - so let's feast and sing 'til our fate calls us.
I thank you for your kindness.
I want to be on the right side.
I was born and raised in Skyrim, but the Nords treat us like dirt.
I'm on my way to Solitude to join the Legion. A united Empire is better for everyone.
I will be Jarl someday, mother?
That is what the Divines have planned for you, yes.
Have you... Do you see that future? Will I be a good leader?
All things are possible, my child. But I believe it is within you to succeed.
I'd simply like to talk to you.
I'll tear out your heart first!
I'm not sure where else I'd go.
Well yes, I did. And thank you so much for helping me.
But... I rather thought that if I were to help, I might... Well, I might be allowed to return to the College.
Indeed.  Alduin wahlaan daanii.
His doom was written when he claimed for himself the lordship that properly belongs to Bormahu - our father Akatosh.
Is he... sifting through trash?

You never know what you'll find laying around in a crate or barrel. People toss the darnedest things in them.
It's not you I'm worried about.
Someday, you can have your own stronghold.
I think it may have to be far away from here.
Oh, if you're worried about me trying to meddle with you...
It's time you learned a lesson.
Nepos is in charge. That's all I know.
You again. Guess you need another lesson, huh?
You've been digging around where you don't belong.
Just never you mind about that.
Dorthe won't eat that. Are you trying to starve the child?
Ay, it is.  I suppose it won't hurt the girl to eat it this once.
And speaking of spoiling Dorthe, who made her a new doll last week?
I've got some fresh cabbage. I'm thinking of making some apple cabbage stew.
She needs to learn to eat what I serve her. I swear, you spoil that child rotten. Besides, it's one of your favorites.
Lady Maven, how may I help you?
I can't afford to just give my jewelry away!
Is it true that you refused to sell one of your... trinkets to Hemming?
Next time a Black-Briar asks for something, I suggest you respond quickly and affirmatively.
Please, milady, it was only because he threatened me. He said he'd have me thrown in the prisons if I didn't give him what he wanted!
Lead on, to Ysgramor and glory.
This is good. Could you show the way to the tomb again?
Let me know when you are, then.
Look at that edge. Still sharp.
Thank you. Here, let an old alchemist pass on some of her secrets to you.
My clan's shield. So Lenne really did stumble into that cave and was eaten by monsters.
I'll present this to the Jarl later. As for you, let me show you some smithing techniques.
Thank you. It's a collection of regrets that I try not to forget. Here, I promised you this.
In honor of his memory, let me show you a few shield techniques. And tell me if you're leaving town. Be good to travel again.
Look at it. That's real Nord craftsmanship, that is! Let me show you an old trick I learned as a scout. Makes it harder for the enemy to notice you.
Mama, when is Cade coming home?
Can I join the Legion when I grow up?
No. I think if I was a young man, I would have done the same.
Endon, we talked about this... Are you still disappointed in Cade's choice?
He's off fighting, Adara, with the Stormcloaks. He'll return when the war is over.
If there's still a Legion left, Adara. I'm sure you'd make a great soldier. Just like your brother.
Our son joining the Stormcloaks. If this war had never happened, Cade would have joined the Imperial Legion, like grandfather.
Meet us here when you're ready.
That is your choice. We will not force you. But to join the Circle, your blood must be as ours.
No, no. Well, I don't think so.
No! Oh, by the gods, please no!
No! You'll never take me alive!
Take the money, just let us go...
Come on... there! I got it, let's go!
Shut up or they'll kill us, you idiot! Once they're gone I'll pick the lock...
Hey, Longhammer, set us up with a round of... what in Oblivion happened in here?
Now I have some time to kill...
There's been word of some trouble nearby. I'm on my way to investigate.
Now, do you require assistance?
Disrupt my Arcanaeum, and I will have you torn apart by angry Atronachs.
You are now in the Arcanaeum, of which I am in charge. It might as well be my own little plane of Oblivion.
Oh. Yes. You all look the same.
Please, you have to believe me!
Help... ? No, no! Look I didn't even know it was her until after she contacted me.
Really? And what might that be?
Really? He's safe? Where is he?
So be it. We gave you a choice.
So I'll cut right to the chase.
Right, then. You prefer to listen, is that it? Well, you must represent the Dark Brotherhood. I certainly wasn't expecting anyone else.
So you do have something, then.
Whether this was intentional or not, it suggests some interesting results.
So, you're the new recruit, eh?
Well, looks like you and I are going to have to get very well acquainted.
Suit yourself. I'm always here.
Thanks Nana. I feel better now.
It's just... aren't you worried about the Forsworn? Maybe it's not safe here.
Yes, child. Nana Ildene has taken care of the Silver-Bloods for many years....
You have worked here in the Treasury House for a long time, haven't you Ildene?
Don't you worry Rhiada. If any Forsworn coming knocking on our door, Nana will let you know....
Thanks. I'll be waiting for it.
Thank you. I'll be waiting for that bottle.
Their disappearance, of course!
Only now... Well, it's simply a disaster.
After years and years of work, I'm closing in on a way to investigate what happened through experimentation.
Instant, unexplainable. The stories have fascinated me... Ever since I was young, I wanted to know what really happened.
This is an utter waste of time.
Very well, I'll keep practicing them.
Ingun! If you want to remain in my shop as an apprentice I expect you to act like one. No exceptions!
Until you can do those formulas with your eyes shut, you'll never be ready to master the more difficult ones.
I don't understand, Elgrim. The formulas you're giving me are for novices but I've advanced well passed that point.
This is not over, I assure you.
So, mage from Winterhold, despite your intentions I've beaten your little game.
Even if all you've said here is lies, I know you have something in Winterhold the Synod Council will be very interested in.
So fine, trudge off to Labyrinthian in search of your Staff. I shall return to Cyrodiil and deliver my full report to the Council.
This was worth coming back for.
You were right about this place. And about Mauhulakh.
Urog and I still hunt a lot, so it's not like I'm cooped up in the longhouse.
Urog is a good learner. I'm glad I have the chance to teach her. Makes me not miss the woods as much.
Though, admittedly... it helps.
Sometimes you just do what needs to be done. You don't have to hate a man to kill him.
Turn back! Before he finds you!
Do you know the way? I'm weary and lost.
Dragonborn, even in death you dog my steps?
Turn back, traveler! Terror waits within this mist.
The bitter war of the world beyond was all for naught.
Shor as well - he welcomes all heroes to his kingly hall, if we could but reach it.
Skyrim was betrayed, the blood of her sons spilled in doomed struggle against fate.
When I woke from cold death, my doom was lifted - there was Shor's Hall, my heart's desire.
Many have braved the shadowed vale but vain is all courage against the peril that guards the way.
I faced him fearlessly - my fate inescapable, yet my honor is unstained - can Ulfric say the same?
We are all trapped in Alduin's web - for our allegiance he cares not, but devours us equally - doom unescapable.
By gods' jest in this grim mist together snared, Stormcloak and Imperial, we wander hopeless, waiting for succor.
When Ulfric Stormcloak, with savage Shout, sent me here, my sole regret was fair Elisif, left forlorn and weeping.
But now I wander, weary and lost. Alduin hunts me as we once hunted our prey - a bitter payment for many bloody deeds.
And so in death, too late, I learn the truth - fed by war, so waxed the power of Alduin, World-Eater - wisdom now useless.
How come you here? The king of this realm will cast you out - cursed be your name by all sons of Skyrim, with scorn unceasing.
In life I felled foes unnumbered, fearless in battle; but no blade can defend against the terror of this gloom-stricken valley.
We are done talking about this.
Well one of us has to do something!
Oh, a customer. Sorry you had to hear that.
Well what are you going to do then, huh? Let's hear it!
I said no! No adventures, no theatrics, no thief-chasing!
We'll see about that, won't we?
Well now. Funny you should ask.
Make your choice. Make your kill. I just want to observe... and admire.
You see, there's a contract out on one of them, and that person can't leave this room alive. But... which one? Go on, see if you can figure it out.
If you turn around, you'll notice my guests. I've [QUOTE]collected[QUOTE] them from... well, that's not really important. The here and now. That's what matters.
Well, for the thrill of course.
He was quite clear that he felt more in his element climbing through a window rather than hunched over a dusty tome.
Well, soldier? Can you do this?
Well? What word of the Emperor?
What are you in for, new blood?
What? How did you get this far?
What? No! Get back in your cage!
Why are you standing here then?
Well it's about time! I had to stall the captain until you were finished.
I've told the captain of the guard we'll have the meadery cleared for the tasting and he could be here any minute.
Yes, a Grand one. Soon, please.
Excellent. Thank you, I'll see that this gets put to good use.
You don't have to tell me that.
You know, I think you're right.
No, I'm afraid I don't know anything of the sort.
You speak in riddles sometimes.
Tradition is very important to me, son.
Well which is it? Look farther or closer?
Come on now, boy, you know what I meant...
To me as well. I think we don't see the same tradition at play here.
If you want to lead this pack when I'm gone, you have to see farther. Look closer.
You treat us fairly. Thank you.
Spoken like a true son of Skyrim!
Spoken like a true daughter of Skyrim!
You wish to trade in Orc steel?
Strong gauntlets for strong hands.
I am the hunts-wife of this stronghold.
We can trade when there's light outside.
Blades to kill your prey and your rivals.
I help in the mines as well as the forge.
You speak to Burguk, chief of Dushnikh Yal.
As forge-wife, I'm also in charge of our mine.
If you wish to trade, wait for the sun to rise.
You need steel? Speak to my forge-wife, Gharol.
Malacath rewards the strong and punishes the weak.
Orc poisons are to be feared, if you wish to trade.
Murbul knows many poisons and cures if you need them.
This stronghold respects strength, and strength alone.
I am Burguk's mother and wise woman to our tribe, outlander.
You should see Gharol if you're looking for a blade or armor.
I am an Orc and a warrior, but I have no desire to become chief.
I have an old cure for Rockjoint. Common in little Orc children.
I am Burguk's favored wife. He knows my beauty should be praised.
Need a poison for your hunting? My mother, Murbul, knows several.
I'm Burguk's forge-wife. I shape all the steel for the stronghold.
I used to wander the corners of Skyrim like you. I miss those days.
I don't know how Ghorbash has so much spirit. He should act his age.
Burguk is a fine chief. He brings strength and wealth to the stronghold.
One day, I must fight my brother Nagrub for chiefdom. It will not be easy.
One day I will shape a weapon fit for a chief. Maybe that chief will be me.
Arob and Gharol eye me with envy. They don't know how to please their chief.
Sorry, outlander, but this old Orc cannot help you. Burguk is the chief here.
We honor the bravest fighters, but I have seen many types of bravery in my travels.
I help my mother Arob with the hunt. We bring much meat and skins to the stronghold.
I work the forge, with my mother Gharol. We mine our own ore and shape our own metal.
Brother Umurn is a strong warrior. I look forward to fighting him for chiefdom one day.
Umurn and Nagrub will be held up as weak next to the son I will one day bear for my chief.
One day, I intend to be chief. I will fight my father and my brother for it, as is tradition.
I serve my chief and my brothers by working in the mines. It's the only place fit for an aging Orc.
You... Really? An Elder Scroll?
You'd do well to remember that.
Of course he does. What sort of a question is that?
Because killing her would yield no political advantage.
You'll pay those rumors no heed if you wish to retain your welcome in this city.
By leaving Elisif alive, Ulfric completes the separation of the Empire and Skyrim.
Maybe you've been listening to Erikur. There's been loose talk among some of the Thanes, and I suspect he's the cause of it.
With Ulfric's troops here, Elisif will be forced to support his bid for High King. He secures the position and appears above reproach.
She may be young, but Elisif is the Jarl by right. And here in Skyrim, if nothing else, we respect the traditions of our father's fathers.
What's more, Ulfric's refusal to execute his slain enemy's wife will be portrayed as the ultimate act of compassion. Hmph. It's genius, really.
You're a cold, unfeeling bitch.
Maven. How's the criminal underworld treating you this fine day?
You may have everyone else impressed around here, but you don't impress me. You couldn't touch me if you wanted to.
I'm watching you, Maven Black-Briar. One day, you'll slip up and your Imperial friends won't be there to catch your fall.
My dear, you have no idea who you're trifling with. Now I suggest you turn around and rattle someone else's cage before you get hurt.
You're a firebrand, aren't you?
It's about time Brynjolf sent me someone with business sense. I was beginning to think he was running some sort of beggar's guild over there.
You're trying my patience, lad.
You're trying my patience, lass.
Your payment, as per the usual.
Wonderful. The only good bard is a dead one, as far as I'm concerned. All that singing and... mirth.
Ah. I have expected you. Prodah.
You have not answered my question. Why do you need to learn this Thu'um?
Do you know why I live here, at the peak of the Monahven - what you name Throat of the World?
You would not come all this way for tinvaak with an old dovah. No. You seek your weapon against Alduin.
And I wasn't stuttering. No key.
Now don't get all upset. Here. Take it.
Are you all right? Can you walk?
I need you on your feet. We're in trouble here.
Are you ready to face the Guild?
Are you finished your other business and ready to face the Guild?
I'm glad you're here. I think some of these people are beginning to suspect who I am.
Assassins? No, nothing so crass.
You can help us with that, and make sure no one else gets hurt.
[QUOTE]Saadia[QUOTE], as you know her, is wanted by the noble houses of Taneth for treason. We were hired to see her returned to Hammerfell for her crimes.
Bloody enough for you, outsider?
But just think of the advantage.
I don't suppose we would ever really trust the thing anyway.
Do you think we could persuade one of the dragons to join our side?
I'm fairly sure that the dragons don't care about our matters one way or the other.
I'm not saying it wouldn't be useful. But there are better uses of our resources right now.
Come on, give it your best shot!
Come on, we'd better get moving.
I hope so. Skyrim needs people like you to fight for her freedom.
Come, help me search for Fenrig.
Coward. You're nothing. Nothing!
Either you're lying to me, or...
Enough talk. There's much to do.
Go away! This is my wreck! Mine!
Hrm. You go find your own wreck. This one's mine.
Good luck finding the fragments.
You won't take my eye, man-thing!
You think to betray Mehrunes Dagon? Suffer!
Looking for the blade? You aren't the first!
I'll just be tending the museum if you need me.
What is it? Do you have one of the Razor fragments?
Before you go, mortal. One final challenge. Ha ha ha.
I keep gazing into the pommel gem. Not a single flaw.
Scholars from around the world will come here one day.
You're after that damn hilt? Go ahead, try and take it!
My family were in the Mythic Dawn. My museum is our legacy.
It's strange holding a hilt that isn't connected to a dagger. Oh well.
Wrong or right, the Mythic Dawn changed Tamriel's history. They deserve study.
Did you have any questions about the museum, or would you rather talk business?
It's not working. Why don't you give it a try? Just put your hands on the altar.
Silus keeps filling his house with those Mythic Dawn things. Creepy, I tell you.
I can't believe Silus is collecting Mythic Dawn artifacts. Right here in Dawnstar, no less.
I've had to be careful handling those blade shards you found. They're each sharp enough to sever a finger with no effort.
Mehrunes Dagon, the Lord of Change, we have brought your Razor to you. We beg you, please bring the blade's full glory to Tamriel again!
Ha! I knew it was you all along.
You're trailing me? I knew I heard something.
How are your chores coming, son?
No, not right now. Maybe later, if I'm still upset.
Are you going to walk over to father and start hitting him again?
I've been cleaning up spills and there is fresh linen for the rooms.
Aren't you wonderful! Why can't your father be more like you and your sister?
I am Tsun, shield-thane to Shor.
where welcome, well-earned, awaits those I judge fit to join that fellowship of honor.
The Whalebone Bridge he bade me guard and winnow all those souls whose heroic end sent them here, to Shor's lofty hall
I appreciate the thought though.
I don't think he would have wanted your absolution, Rorlund. He worshiped Talos.
I wish we could have absolved your brother-in-law of his sins before his execution.
I ask only for a little charity.
Spare a coin for a poor old woman?
Fresh fruit and vegetables for sale!
This place reeks of gray-skin filth!
We don't want your kind here, dark elves!
Get out of our city, gray-skins! This is Nord land!
The Divines smile on those who show mercy an' charity.
Have a look around. I buy and sell just about anything.
Take home Windhelm's finest and freshest produce today!
Fruits and vegetables, all ripe and ready for your table!
A few septims ain't nothing. You can spare that, can't you?
Assorted fruits and vegetables, all delicious and affordable!
Will you spare a few coins to help someone who's got nothing?
I don't appreciate loiterers, if that's what you're here to do.
Go back to Morrowind, Dark Elf maggots! You're not welcome here!
I've a little of everything for sale, come and see for yourself!
Come and browse my fine selection! Everything's fresh and delicious!
Feast your eyes on my strange and wondrous collection of curiosities.
Cookware, knives and other goods for the home, all at reasonable prices!
Hear my prayer, son of Akatosh, and grant peace to these departed souls.
Make yourself at home, please. Let me know if I can be of any assistance.
I hope you have coin to spend, and you're not just here to gawk at my goods.
Assorted wares and tools you just can't live without! Come and see for yourself!
Buying and selling a wide range of assorted goods! The best selection in Windhelm!
For a few septims, I'll give you a brief tour that includes some of my most unusual items.
Mighty Arkay, I pray that you will shepherd these souls as they pass into the realm of death.
Lord of Seasons, I pray to you now that you might watch over the dead with mercy and kindness.
I'm always happy to see a customer, but I won't deal in stolen goods. That's trouble I don't need.
You like living in this filthy slum, dark elves? Maybe you should go back to Morrowind, where you belong!
The objects you see here might look mundane at first glance, but I assure you, behind each is an unusual tale.
Mighty Arkay, God of Mortals, hear now the prayers of your humble servant. Bless these departed souls and welcome them into the realms beyond.
I hear you've been busy of late.
I need some things for the ship.
If you give me a list, I'll have them delivered to the dock by tomorrow morning.
I need you to retrieve the poem.
Yes. According to Giraud, our histories keeper, the portion of the Edda dealing with King Olaf might still exist in Dead Man's Respite.
Yes. According to Giraud, our histories keeper, the portion of the Edda dealing with King Olaf might still exist in the Dead Man's Respite.
I owe you some answers, don't I?
I think you're looking for this.
I told you, it's from my family.
I don't... I know they always disapproved of what I wanted in life, to learn magic instead becoming a farmer, or a hunter.
But no matter how poorly they may have treated me, they're still my family. I didn't consider that until after I'd made the trade.
I was hoping you would say that.
I'll find that Elf. I always do.
I'm a warrior, not a blacksmith.
Can't you just tell me if the grip is bad?
I've got a bad grip on my shield, could you take a look at it?
If Eorlund made it, it's more likely you're gripping it wrong. Find me tomorrow and we can go over it.
I'm afraid it's not that simple.
If only we knew where she was...
Karliah and I were like partners. I went with her on every heist. We watched each other's backs.
I know her techniques, her skills. If she kills me, there'll be no one left that could possibly catch her.
It certainly is. Was, I suppose.
He would never have willingly parted with it. What a shame.
It's my hope that you will, yes.
It's okay, mother. I understand.
Gralnach! I told you not to go through your father's things!
He was a wonderful man, and he loved us very much. I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I'm sorry mother, I just want to know more about him. You never tell me anything!
I'm sorry mother, now that he's dead, I just want to know everything I can about him.
I wish you didn't hate him so much... I wish the whole family could be together again.
That's because there's nothing to tell. He left us to fend for ourselves and that's all you need to know.
Keep it up and you'll go places.
We're all behind you, friend. Do your best.
Delvin and Vex have been running things for now.
Never seen the guy so angry. Better help him out any way you can.
Just watch your back and do what Mercer says... he'll sort it out.
So, word has it you and Brynjolf know where Mercer's hiding. Good.
Last few years have been pretty bad. I've almost closed this place up.
The word is that Mercer Frey is a dead man. The Guild wants his blood.
I don't know about the others, but I sure am glad to see a fresh face down here.
You need to teach him a lesson... show him the penalty for betrayal around here.
The Flagon used to be packed every night with the boys from the Guild but now look at it.
Well, you did something Vex couldn't do at Goldenglow, so you're looking pretty damn good.
Make sure you make him pay for what he did to Gallus... heck, for what he did to all of us.
I hope this all gets straightened out soon or I'm headed on the first caravan out of Riften.
Business is booming, coin is flowing and everyone seems content as things keep going our way.
I know you have a damn good reason for siding with Karliah, so I hope you can give it to them.
I only hope we can restore the Guild to its former glory after all the damage that's been done.
A new chapter in the Thieves Guild is being written this day and we all owe it to you. Many thanks.
I can't say I blame them. Murder is not our way. Gallus was before my time, but I still can't believe it.
Whatever you did at Honningbrew, you're now on her good side. Best of all, if she's happy, Mercer's happy.
Everyone's been worried since you and Mercer haven't shown up in a while. Brynjolf even went out to find you.
Maven was down here right before you got back and she was all smiles. Haven't seen her like that in a long time.
Sure. How about you mind your own business about it, and I won't have to get Dirge to toss you into the cistern?
Word is that you found something while you were out there though... something that could be a problem for the Guild.
I don't know you so we've got nothing to talk about. How about you finish the job Brynjolf gave you, then we can talk.
I haven't seen so much celebrating in years. Mercer's dead, we have a new Guild Master and things are finally looking up.
Look, I like you, so I'll tell it to you straight. Brynjolf and the rest are in the Guild, and they're ready to cut you down.
Mercer's been storming around waiting for you to come back. I think he's finally figured out who's been messing with the Guild.
Glad to hear Gulum-Ei got what he deserved. That lizard owes me big for a bad shipment of Shadowbanish Wine he tried to pass off on me.
Let me give you a bit of advice.
You need something you're not officially supposed to have, you come see me.
You tell anyone that I told you, and I'll fry you from the inside out. Got it? Good.
You want to work on something that's not officially allowed? Don't tell anyone you're doing it.
Maven sends her regards Letrush.
No, how did you find me? Just give me more time, I can pay Maven back!
You! You must have told Maven about the horse. If you'd just stuck to the plan, I wouldn't be in this mess.
Mercer never told you about her?
Karliah is the thief responsible for murdering the previous Guild Master, Gallus. Now she's after Mercer.
My parents are being impossible.
My mother's not any help, either.
He only cares about this stupid town, but Bassianus makes me happier than anyone ever has.
Bassianus wants to marry me. And I think I love him. But he wants to move to Riften afterwards, and my father won't allow it.
Namira watch over you, champion.
You're one of Namira's faithful now.
It's an honor to see you, the keeper of Namira's ring.
Thanks again for saving my life. I think I'm done with venturing outside of Markarth, though.
No? Very well, it's your choice.
Now tell me where my brother is!
A likely story. They won't even do their own dirty work now, eh? Well, you won't get the better of me!
Now you're speaking my language.
Consider me your new friend in the north.
Tell you what. If you need any stolen goods fenced, you bring them to me and I'll pay you good money for them.
Now, if, um... you'll get going?
Ha! Well, I certainly do feel that way.
Now, you go about your business.
I won't repeat them, and I won't allow them to be spread under this roof.
It's no secret that Jarl Idgrod is... different. It's also no secret that there are rumors about her and her visions.
Oh, I see. Is it still too soon?
Have you thought about my invitation?
And now you've found me. Can I help you?
I'm sorry to be such a bother. We'll talk another time.
Captain Lonely-Gale! I've been looking for you everywhere!
I've thought about it, but I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
Yes, I think that must be it. My wife hasn't been gone that long, after all. Ask me again on another day.
Oh, wait... it gets much better.
Here's the best part. They took me as a prize, and violated me for a fortnight. Tossed me from bandit to bandit like... like...
How about the fact that our farm was attacked by bandits, and that they killed my entire family who didn't even brandish a weapon against them.
Oh. Oh-no. This won't do at all.
I knew it was at the Dead Man's Respite.
Ah wonderful, I knew it would be. This is a significant find.
The copy is incomplete, it's aged to the point that parts are unreadable.
I have to admit I didn't think it would actually be there.  Now let's take a look at this...
And the parts that are readable... well... bardic verse has come a long way since ancient times.
I'll let Viarmo take possession but I will be looking forward to adding this to our library. Good work.
Oh. Oh-no. This won't do at all. The copy is incomplete, it's aged to the point that parts are unreadable.
That's tremendous! I have to admit I didn't fully believe it still existed. Now let's take a look at this...
Please. Please just let me be...
Yes, yes, for the hundredth time, I am a Breton. I was born in High Rock. And then I came here. I am not a Reachman!
Savos. Before... before he died.
She'll make a fine wife someday.
It seems like Dorthe grows a head taller every season.
Thank Shor I have a lot of years before I have to worry about that!
Aye. She's helping me in the house, and even helps her father at the forge.
So, you in for a little fishin'?
Got a mark taxed with carryin' a heavy item. Care to lighten' the load?
Got ourselves a freelancer thinks he can muscle in on our territory. How about you teach him some manners, eh?
This brilliant soul decided to pick a fight with a fellow Guild mate. Time for them to pay the piper. Will you help out?
Brynjolf want's this mark's head on a pike, but we'll settle for what the bastard's carryin' instead. Can I count on you?
Sure, I've got a mark for you. Stole something quite important from a friend of the Guild and we take care of our own. You in?
I've got a mark who just got an item from a relative outside of Skyrim. They probably should have been quieter about it. You in?
Maven wants this mark's most prized possession. The bloody fool carries it on his person all the time. So, think you can handle it?
One of our marks seems to have an item of value we want to add to our vault. Get it for us and you'll receive the usual pay. Sound good?
There are all sorts of people wandering around carryin' their valuables on their person... just waitin' for someone like you to pick their pocket.
Sorry, was only joking with you.
I mean, someone who's not me, that is.
Well, she's dead. But I guess that's not unusual, at least not for somebody in here.
Such was my... honor. As Keeper.
So Cicero brought our Lady to her new home. Here! This is the only Sanctuary left in all of Skyrim, you see.
The Night Mother's crypt in Bravil was... desecrated. The Imperial Province is ravaged by strife. Nowhere there is safe, at present.
Sure, my voice could use a rest.
Thanks for looking after Hrefna.
Well, I know she thinks the world of you.
Well, I'll try to be a good influence, then.
Oh, it's no trouble. She's a smart little girl. Might talk your ear off, but she's fun.
That wasn't so hard, now was it.
Stay away from my family if you value your life.
I trust this is the last I'll hear of your violent outbursts.
You stay away from my family. Or you die. Be smart. Stay away.
This had better be the last I hear of you disrespecting my family.
Any further dishonor done to my kin, and I'll put you in the ground.
Good. But know that further dishonor to my family will mean your death.
Mark these words carefully, fetcher. Stay away from my family, or I will paint the ground with your blood.
The [QUOTE]Eye of Magnus[QUOTE]?
But let's not jump to any conclusions, or assign it importance beyond what we're certain of.
I can appreciate that this... thing, this Orb... It's very impressive. Very unique, and definitely worth studying.
Then I think we're done talking.
Then you'll see some real magic.
Place the crystal in the center of the armillary. Then we can worry about attuning it.
You'll need to use spells to do that. Being from the College, I assume you know them already.
Now the crystal needs to be focused. It was created so far away, we knew that some adjustments would have to be made.
Heating and cooling the crystal will cause it to expand or contract, which will change how the light passes through it.
There should be a few basic tomes around here somewhere in case your training is even more sub-standard than I've heard.
You'll have to get the crystal to focus properly. Heat and cold will affect it; simple concentration spells should be enough.
You'll also need to align the mirrors using the controls up above. Once everything is lined up, the light will reflect back through the crystal.
Think you've got the mettle, eh?
But talk to Legate Rikke. She handles the local recruiting.
Ulfric's not running a social club. You don't join anything. Either you're a true son of Skyrim, or you're not.
Ulfric's not running a social club. You don't join anything. Either you're a true daughter of Skyrim, or you're not.
If you're serious, make your way to Solitude. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. You find General Tulius there, commanding our forces in Skyrim.
If you're serious, you're in the right place. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. Here you'll find General Tullius, commanding our forces in Skyrim.
Honestly, the Legion can use all the able bodies it can muster. We have our hands full. A dead king, a rebellion, and now dragons? Skyrim's a mess.
This is lovely, as always, Eola.
Thank you, Lisbet. It's been such a joy to dine with you all these years.
We both leave well enough alone.
No, but then I don't have much need for Ulfric.
We've been awaiting your return.
Well, I was only trying to help.
Fine, I'll just save myself then. Thank you for letting me out of that cage.
Were you able to learn anything?
Well, I do recall warning them it might not be the safest of locations. I hope this doesn't become a problem for us.
What are you waiting for? Do it!
By the gods, stop toying with me and do it!
I'm ready. I made my peace with the gods long ago.
With me, you kill Skyrim's last hope. Mark my words. You'll all be serving elven masters soon. And know then, that I would have stopped them.
What is that blowhard up to now?
So, he thinks he can turn Camilla against me? Two can play at this.
Here. Give this letter to Camilla and tell her it's from Sven. Let's see what she thinks of him after reading that.
What? Did... you need something?
I have nothing to say to you. Just... leave me alone.
Why? What are you gonna do, cry?
Yeah, that's what papa says too.
Yeah, well I don't see anything.
You got anything in here worth buying?
I certainly hope so, otherwise I'm wasting my time.
Yes, I hear that question often.
My brother Anoriath and I came up with it one night after consuming... rather too much mead.
He shot an arrow that pierced my... well, my rump. After such a memorable adventure, we knew we had the name for our shop.
After our drinks, we went out for a moonlight hunt. We got separated, and in his drunken state my brother mistook me for a deer.
Yes, well. Perhaps you're right.
They got used to Idgrod just fine, didn't they? So what's the difference?
When are you gonna do somethin' to help Falion? Stop people sayin' things about him?
You have to understand, his presence here has caused... Well, it's difficult for the people to get used to.
You drove them off? By yourself?
Thank you! We'll head back to work, right away. Take this, it's the least I can do.
You mean the inn, or Winterhold?
A few of us are either too stubborn or too crazy to go, so we do our best to make a living.
Suppose it's the same answer, either way. Winterhold's fallen on hard times, to say the least. Most folk packed up and left years ago.
You survived! You have it, then?
Let's hope it's as powerful as the Psijics believe it to be.
Your a hard woman to please Una.
Most of those don't happen very often.
I keep coming out here thinking I'll see what others see in this... frivolity.
I'm pleased when the palace is clean, I'm pleased when the beds are made on time, I'm pleased when I Erdi isn't around.
Ah, have you? Let Kesh have them.
And what might you be looking at?
Oh, the fruit looks so good. So juicy.
No handouts today, Brenuin. Now scat. You'll scare off my paying customers.
You've got the heart of Mara herself, you know that? Thank you, Carlotta. Thank you.
Oh, just one apple, Carlotta? Just one tiny apple. I'll pay you tomorrow, I swear it.
That's what you said last week, and the week before that. Now go, before I call a guard.
No, no! Don't do that. No need to do that. I'm going. See? I'm leaving. No guards, please.
Look, come back tomorrow, okay? If I have anything left that's not sold or spoiled, you can have it.
But how would you know it's real?
Eh. I try not to trouble myself with stories of the outside world.
Now if someone brings me a dragon scale, that's a different story.
Calixto, do you know if there's any truth to these rumors of dragons?
Ah, I can't reveal all my secrets to you. But rest assured, I would know.
Come closer. Bask in my presence.
Deliver this axe to Jarl Hrongar.
Deliver this axe to Balgruuf the Greater.
I'm glad you're here. I have a message I need delivered to the Jarl of Whiterun.
Dibella's Heart, son, I hope not.
We don't fight, son. We, um, talk. Loudly.
Father, why do you and mother fight so much?
Will I need to talk so loudly with my wife when I get married?
Do I know you? I didn't think so.
I don't remember seeing you at one of these before.
I wasn't expecting to see you here! I assume you have your reasons. Everyone does.
The only reason I'm here is because my refusal to attend would cause a diplomatic incident.
I swear Elenwen holds these parties just to make the Empire look bad. Almost makes me want to join the Stormcloaks.
Look around the room and you'll see what we're up against. Just between you and me, a lot of what Ulfric says about the Empire is true.
Don't get too flowery on me, lad.
Don't get too flowery on me, lass.
Elenwen must be very fond of you.
Why, thank you. You are most courteous.
I admit, I'm surprised to see you here. Normally these parties are reserved for  the Jarls and business leaders of Skyrim.
Feel like doing a bit of writin'?
Most of the establishments in Skyrim keep their transactions recorded within business ledgers.
Yeah, sure. Got a business on tap that could use a little number rearrangin'. What do you say?
Your job would be to change the numbers in those books so the shortfalls from our other jobs look legit.
All right. Got a simple one. Just get in, change the books and be back in time for last call. So how's about it?
Okay, got just the one for you. Ledger's just beggin' to be changed and the Guild could use the coin. How about it?
These marks keep their ledger all neat and tidy, but they're ripe for some change if you know what I mean. Take it?
This business is a regular target for the Guild. They keep pretty shoddy records, so the job should be a cinch. You in?
We want to waylay a shipment on the way from this business without them even noticin' anything went missin'. Want the job?
Have a client lookin' to have a rival's business ledger changed. Don't know the reason, and don't want to know. Count you in?
Got a personal request from Brynjolf on this numbers job. He says we may hit 'em hard later, and wants to prep their books. Help us out?
Go. Out. Before I change my mind.
Good. I'll be waiting right here.
Have you been learning your ores?
Don't even bother with that one. Leave it to the orcs.
Oh, right. That makes sense. Kind of a messy metal, anyway.
I think I've got a handle on it, but Orichalcum is confusing.
Here. A little something for you.
It's amazing how much you can learn from a book.
Thank you. Let me show you some tricks around the forge.
Now that's what I like to see. Someone who gets things done.
Don't know what the Redguards see in books, but this will make my Seren happy.
I hope Arkay grants my wife some comfort. Thank you. Here. I always pay my debts.
Here. Let me show you some of the things the temple healers taught me about potions.
Thank you. This should turn that old cat's gaze. Maybe I'll be able to become a caravaneer myself, one day.
Good. I'll see if I can get some copies made for the men. Here, something for your trouble. The Legion thanks you.
As promised, let me show you a thing or two about bargaining. Don't want some shifty merchant giving you a raw trade.
Here. Take my amulet as a reward.
I don't need to know the details. Blessings of Arkay to you for your help.
Hey, here. Have one on the house.
Good. Now shut up and get out of my face.
Oh yeah? I think so too. You're pretty smart.
Hey! You dropped this back there.
You left this over there. You want it back, right? Here.
I think you accidentally mislaid this, dear. Here you go.
You should take more care, leaving things lying about. Here.
I think you dropped this! Good thing I brought it to you, huh?
You left this back there. Figured you'd be wantin' it. Here ya go.
Excuse me. You misplaced this, I believe? There you go. Take care now.
You left this over there. You're lucky - someone else might have kept it for himself. Here you go.
You dropped this. Good thing I found it and not someone else, otherwise you might have lost it for good.
How in the world did that happen?
I can go back to my life for now.
And I have you to thank for it. I won't forget this.
I didn't think you'd get pinched.
Can't say I'm surprised with the way things have been going around here.
I have no more business with you.
People think they can run away from their crimes, but I will always catch up with them and make them pay.
I trust the night finds you well?
Yes, lad? Did you need something?
Yes, lass? Did you need something?
Good to see you, lad! How are things?
Planning some exciting heists I hope?
Good to see you, lass! How are things?
Things are looking up around here, lad.
Things are looking up around here, lass.
Enjoying your newfound abilities I trust?
What brings you back to Nightingale Hall?
Things seem to be going well at the Guild.
I'm hearing good things about you from Brynjolf.
Leave me alone. Haven't you done enough damage already?
It was you, wasn't it. I should of known better. Now look at me.
Maven be damned. One day, she'll get hers. I can promise you that.
You've sent an innocent man to jail. I hope your proud of yourself.
What's left of the Honningbrew has been dumped into the sewers. Good riddance.
If you have anything you're having a hard time selling, I can take it off your hands.
Maven Black-Briar always remembers her friends. That's why I'm in charge of the place.
Now that this is a Black-Briar Meadery, you can be sure that we'll be selling only the best mead in Skyrim.
I want to hear about this dragon.
I wonder what Irileth is so excited about?
I... well, let me think about it.
War of mine? It's not my war, Seren!
Hammerfell? I'm not against the idea, but why?
I'm just worried about raising a child in the middle of this war of yours.
Rustleif, I've been wondering. Maybe after the baby is born, we should move to Hammerfell.
Your people's war, I mean. The Nords. What kind of life would we be giving our little one if we stayed here?
I'm Anska.  Are you here to help?
If he's willing, then we'll talk.
Look, friend, if you think you can do better than the legion of guards, be my guest.
You'll need to talk to Jorleif, though. We can't just let anyone go around claiming to be on official business.
Is there any news from High Rock?
Regardless. It appears Skyrim must stand alone. Again.
Those milk drinkers? Might as well be elves. Think they're better than us.
I suppose we shouldn't be surprised. They've never had many problems with the Empire.
Not a peep. Those prissy Bretons can't be made to lift a finger to help their neighbors.
It... it worked. Mara be praised!
You vanished after drinking the Torpor and materialized on the other side. I have never seen anything quite like it.
Let me give you a word of advice.
Hm. Well, if you change your mind, come see me again.
Think about your choices carefully from now on. You'll go much farther in Riften with me on your side.
Nice try, but you don't scare me.
Well. I, uh, can see you're not one to be trifled with. Let this be a warning to you!
No idea what's causing it though.
Be careful in there, you can take a nasty spill.
I might be a woman, but I can crack rock with the best of them.
Redbelly Mine gets its name from the red mist filling the place.
Mining iron takes a lot of strength and special reinforced tools.
I must have broken five or six pickaxes in the last few months alone.
But when you can sniff out a vein of iron like me, it isn't too much trouble.
You get used to it after a while... kind of smells like the hot springs out in the tundra.
Damn place is filled with this reddish mist. Can't see more than ten feet in front of your face.
But now that I've got Rocksplinter here, I can cut through stone like a hot knife through butter.
Not going to weigh in either way?
I admire your restraint, but there are times when you must make decisions, even without all the facts. Rely on instinct.
Oh, my, I hadn't thought of that.
There are places in the world that aren't wrapped in ice, you know.
I'll bet this is better than trying to grow something in Morrowind, though, isn't it?
Firstly, I've never even seen Morrowind. Secondly, in volcanic soil the plants practically grow themselves.
Or else what? You don't scare me.
You have a death wish or something?
You're threatening me? Oh, that's rich!
Please, just... just leave me be!
Please! Release me! Cut my bonds!
You cut these bindings this minute! You hear me? You cut these bindings right now!
Come now, my friend. Haven't we played this game long enough? Untie me, and we can all go our separate ways.
Pleasure doin' business with you.
You don't have enough to earn my loyalty.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Pretty, pretty flesh. Let me out!
Quickly, we have no time to lose.
I've spoken to Karliah, and made amends for how the Guild's treated her. Now she wishes to speak with both of us.
Agreed. He's taken everything the Guild has left, and to go after one of the last greatest heists is just an insult.
Remember, this is between us now.
That'll teach me to try and make extra coin around this city.
Be careful with Sapphire. She's mixes with all sorts of nasty people.
See that it doesn't happen again.
So, not much has changed, really.
Well, the Stormcloak guards drink a lot more than the Imperials did, so I've been making more money lately.
On the other hand, they're a violent bunch. Every night a fight breaks out and I end up with a smashed chair or a broken table.
So, you don't need anything then.
Was there something specific you needed?
[QUOTE]Disappointed[QUOTE] is not the word I would choose, Colette. Excuse me.
I'm positive whatever I require will be revealed to me on its own, in due time.
Oh, my dear Urag. You're trying so hard to help. I do hope you're not disappointed.
Some take to it more than others.
Not every Companion, though. Only members of the Circle all share the blood of the beast.
I see you've been allowed to know some secrets before your appointed time. No matter. Yes, it's true.
Song or not, I just want it done.
Well, Dragonborn. What do you say? Do you want the honor?
Sure thing. It's yours for a day.
Are you joking? You just rented a room from me.
What does this look like, the Temple of Mara? No gold, no bed.
Sweet breath of Arkay, thank you.
The mist is gone! A glorious day!
The World-Eater is dead! The way is now clear!
You saved us all. We will sing of you forever.
Hero of the Nords I name you, Dragonborn, let none deny it.
I hear your heart beat like the Harbingers of old. Your glories in Skyrim are seen and honored.
In life we were enemies, but eternity's too long to hold a grudge - my heart's now free of such old hatreds.
The one who calls himself Ancano.
His path will cross yours in time, but first you must find that which you need.
He seeks information about the Eye, but what he will find shall be quite different.
The very thought breaks my heart.
Any one of us could enter that chamber silently. Unnoticed. But who amongst us would dare conspire against the Sanctuary?
That's the real question, isn't it? The jester enters, seals the door, and the conversation begins. So someone must be waiting for him inside.
There's always the Thieves Guild.
No, no, no. I need this job! This is the last place in town to have work.
Wujeeta, you can't keep showing up here late. Bolli's just going to get someone to replace you.
Nothing, nothing. Just straighten yourself out before you find yourself headed back to Black Marsh.
They are perfect. Thank you both.
Hello, dear husband. Have you brought more silver jewelry for me to sell?
Yes, I have. Adara made the rings herself. She is learning to bend the metal well.
This is all your fault, you know.
Don't worry, I'll make it worth your while.
I'm stuck fighting a giant now, thanks to you. So you're going to help me.
You're going with me, and you're going to make sure I don't have any trouble reaching that giant.
This is why I avoid being social.
What? Why, the audacity! How dare you imply such a thing!
You've been spending a fair bit of time with Sergius lately, I see.
Oh! Well... I... I'm sorry. Yes, we have been working on something together.
Calm down! Why are you over-reacting? I was going to ask if the two of you are collaborating on research!
Was in over her head, I'm afraid.
Ahhh. Quite fine my friend. Quite fine.
So sad what happened to young Elisif. Tragic really. Such a young and pretty girl.
But we should be done with murders in the Blue Palace. I've stepped up security around here.
We bring honor to the Companions.
For the glory of the Companions! For Ysgramor!
We did well today, Shield-Sister.
We did well today, Shield-Brother.
We need to get back to Jorrvaskr.
We shall safeguard it... for now.
You have our gratitude, Arch-Mage.
You now have the opportunity to maintain your College, and carry on with your lives.
It must be secured. Ancano's actions prove that the world is not ready for such a thing.
The Eye has grown unstable. It cannot remain here, or else it may destroy your College and this world.
Well, a few reasons come to mind.
In my days as a riverboat captain, I was known to run a tight ship.
That, and I made my fortune by knowing when to spend my septims, and when not to. I can't stand waste.
Well, I'm not quite done myself.
Well. I wish it were that simple.
I can't go near his body. Would you get it back for me?
Maybe it is. Look, I want to go back but I won't feel right in there without a tie to Talos.
My brother Roggvir wore a symbol of Talos. He kept it hidden on his person. If I had that...
Well... yes. There is something.
It won't repair the tree back at the temple, but we could bring them a new one.
What did you say to me, Reachman?
Alms. Give me some meat, you fat Nord!
You little twig. I'll snap you in two!
Just try it. Maybe a little time inside Cidhna Mine will get rid of all that fat on you.
I said give me some meat. I'm hungry, and the Divines know you don't need more food in that huge gut of yours.
What do you know about soul gems?
What is life's greatest illusion?
What, you still think it's funny?
Why? You think it's funny or something?
They call me Dirge, 'cause I'm the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground.
I already told you. They call me Dirge, 'cause I'm the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground.
What? Why, are you... interested?
When will Sanuarach Mine be open?
I don't know. Whenever those Silver-Blood men decide to leave.
Whichever it is, I don't like it.
I see. If something does happen, you know where I am.
Either this is some kind of a joke, or you're keeping something from me.
Wish I could say the same for us.
Tolfdir and I can try and keep this contained. You need to get your hands on the Staff of Magnus. Now.
Yes, and I couldn't tell you why.
My wife and I think there's some dark magic at work. Or perhaps Arkay's influence is strong here, and he likes to keep it this way.
You already know all that I know.
There's nothing more I can teach you.
You've already learned all I can teach you.
You aren't angry about it, right?
Oh, you heard about that, huh? Uh, sorry boss. I was going to speak to Delvin about cutting the Guild in, but I forgot.
You can offer, but I may not buy.
We could use someone with your skills.
Tonilia, can I offer some friendly advice?
Thanks for the compliment, Delvin. I may just take you up on that one day.
Why don't you just formally join up? Quit sittin' here wheelin' and dealin' when you could be out there makin' a heck of a lot more coin.
You should probably speak to her.
Just in time. This is Adelaisa, one of my superiors from the Company.
She's been dispatched to... eh... see to it that we get back on schedule.
You will hear me out, then? Good.
You're the Dragonborn aren't you?
Can any man hope to be ready for a dragon?
I can but hone their skills and harden their hearts. The rest is up to the gods.
I'm sort of hoping you're going to fight the dragons for us. A normal man is no match for a dragon.
A battle-mage of fearsome cunning.
Our secret ingredient, if you will.
Runs the Blood Horkers, and makes sure the battles end right-side up.
Ah. Indeed, indeed. I do remember.
Delphine really is alive, then? You'd better come in then and tell me how you found me and what you want.
All right, I'll take a look at it.
Well I nearly lost my eyebrows to it.
Again? But there shouldn't be any earthstreams over there.
Roggi tell you about the scorcher we found under the scaffolding?
Alright, you are now under arrest.
Is that so? Well, perhaps a night in jail might loosen your tongue. Hmmm?
And I'm telling you, you're wrong.
What makes you so sure? What if I'm right?
I've been cracking rock ever since I was able to hold a pickaxe and I'm telling you, this mine is drying up.
I know there's ore still in there, I can smell it. If you think you're right then you can pack up and leave any time you like.
And now you have it. No harm done.
Taking it was the only way I could be sure this wasn't a Thalmor trap.
I knew the Greybeards would send you for the horn if they thought you were Dragonborn.
Are you all right? You seem tired.
Of course. I would have it no other way.
With you by my side, is that right Horik?
I'm fine, Horik. I just... are you worried about this war?
So much for old soldiers settling down to a life of luxury, eh?
No. If we must fight, we will, and you will lead us to victory. As you always have.
Are you ready to give me the Star?
Stendarr's Mercy. You found it. Azura's Star.
It would mean cutting the Star off from Azura. Only black souls would be able to enter it once we finished.
Maybe this is my chance to make things right. I can finish Malyn's work, the way we had meant to before his madness.
At this rate that'll never happen.
Quit your bellyaching. We've all got our problems.
You think living with Grogmar is easy? Did you see how he lives?
You two will just have to learn to get along until we can build you another house.
Beem! What are you doing? Stop it!
Best leave the past buried, I say.
But that's your problem, not mine.
Then we have nothing more to say to one another.
100 gold will secure my release. You can afford that, can't you?
I suppose you'd better hope you can, if you want the information.
Kematu is west of Whiterun. It's an unassuming little cave called Swindler's Den.
You realize if you set foot in there, you're never coming back out. They'll kill you.
Get the money into the hands of one of these guards, and I'll tell you what you want to know.
But why? Why must you stop Alduin?
Yes. Alduin... zeymah. The elder brother. Gifted, grasping and troublesome as is so often the case with firstborn.
C'mon, let's get something to eat.
Gods, I'll be glad to see the last of Skyrim.
*Sigh*... and that's the last one. All right, enough of this.
Nothing to do now but sit back, relax, and enjoy the trip home.
I think we'll all feel better once we're back out to sea. Won't be long now.
Well, it's all over now. Lieutenant said you could see the smoke from Whiterun.
Dragons, murder, rebellion... and we sail right into the middle of it with the Emperor on board.
Yeah. I'm glad we can finally stand down- getting tired of looking over my shoulder all the time.
Don't say something you'll regret.
Last thing the Black-Briars need is some loudmouth tryin' to meddle in their affairs.
Eh? Who's there? Rodulf, that you?
Five, four, three, two, one... go!
Fjola?  How do you know that name?
Have you seen one in your travels?
Travelers have been coming to Whiterun. They tell stories about dragons.
I've heard of them, but didn't think they were real. Have you ever seen one?
I've been hearing stories about dragons. That they're back. That they can eat the sun out of the sky and freeze a man where he stands.
Haven't you got some chores to do?
Papa says I'm not old enough yet, so I help out by patrolling the town with Lucky here.
Your father's too easy on you, boy. I'd have you cutting wood at dawn if you were my son.
He must have been very convincing.
I've never known Avulstein to be that convincing! Where is the little scamp?
Here you are. So sorry about that.
What? Oh! How could I have possibly forgotten. Your reward, of course... of course.
Here you go, sir. Colovian brandy.
Here you go, miss. Colovian brandy.
Is there anything else I can get for you?
Here you go, sir. The finest Colovian brandy.
Here you go, ma'am. The finest Colovian brandy.
I'm sorry, but I think you've had enough for the moment.
We seem to have run out of Colovian brandy. I'll check in the wine cellar for more when I get a moment.
Here you go. This should cover it.
Here's your share of their reward.
Nice work with this one. You make us all proud.
And it looks undamaged. They'll be pleased, I'm sure. And we're pleased with their money.
Give it here. They've asked for the utmost discretion on this matter, so I'll make sure it gets to them.
Hey! Somebody get down here! Help!
Hhhmmm...maybe I put it over here.
No matter. Another one will be along any time now.
Just walk toward the chest! Gravity will do the rest.
It's got to be somewhere around here! Now where did I put it?
Don't worry though. It'll be relatively painless...relatively.
I know you're up there. Go get the treasure. Doesn't it look pretty?
Come on! You know you want what's in that chest. Just walk toward it!
Well...that's disappointing. This one didn't survive the fall either.
Alright, let's see if we have something here to end this as quickly as possible.
Ah...Here it is. Now, if you'd be so kind as to stand still this will be much easier for me to do.
Ooooh...yes...yes. You've fallen for my trap! Greed makes a great lure. Odd you didn't die from the fall though. Most do.
Oh, and don't mind my assistant here. He may have seen better days, but he's still more help to me dead than he was alive.
Oh, and I wasn't entirely truthful before. This is actually going to hurt a lot. You see, you have to be dead in order for the spell to take hold.
Hold it there! Keep your distance.
I am not going to let that happen!
Because they've got Thorald locked away somewhere, and if they find me here I'll disappear too!
I consider this conversation over.
I don't know. What'd he look like?
Mama, can we talk. You know, about papa?
Of course, sweetie. What'd you like to know?
He had your soft face, and that silly grin you get when you've done something wrong. That's his, too.
I fear that will be the way of it.
You're a cold hearted bastard, aren't you?
A true Nord never fears death. It's the how and why of it that one needs consider.
I just need a little to get going.
I wouldn't hold out too much hope.
I'll buy everything you've dug up.
Mining is hard work, but we pay a fair price for any ore you dig up.
Are you looking to work? The mines are nearby. You bring me ore, I'll give you coin.
I'll take a bottle of spiced wine.
A bottle of spiced wine for ya, Ataf?
I haven't known you to drink before, Ataf.
No thank you. I'm still feeling sick from the festival.
Viarmo is trying to get Elisif to allow the Burning of King Olaf. I don't want to look like I don't know how to drink in front of the other bards.
I'll try to forget you ever asked.
Thank you. I knew you'd understand.
Yes, this probably isn't really the place for your little jokes.
Don't presume upon our friendship. My first loyalty is to the Thalmor, as you well know.
Yes, that's probably for the best. I really shouldn't risk getting on Elenwen's bad side.
I'm cutting your pay for this job.
Be more careful next time. This isn't a game.
I'm... I'm not sure what happened.
I hope we didn't offend him somehow.
A monk from the Psijic Order, here, after all these years, and then he just leaves.
I've got a feeling about this one.
But someone keeps taking them down.
You say you found it in Hjerim? Friga's old place. Let's go have a look around there.
I've been trying to put those up around the city, to warn people. Have them keep their eyes open.
Ingun? She's brilliant; a natural!
Oh dear, I didn't mean to say she isn't bright.
Elgrim, honey. I'm concerned about your new pupil. She seems very... odd.
Damn it, woman! Ingun is the most promising alchemist I've ever seen and I won't have you scaring her off!
It's the things she makes here, the things she says and all those poor little animals she tests them on. It's just not right.
Is that so? I was right about you.
Is there something you need, dear?
All right, can you describe it to me?
If it does to you, dear, that's all that matters.
I... I'm not sure. I think perhaps, but I don't know what it is.
No, I'm sorry. I'll just... I'll know it if I find it. Does that make sense?
It is my job to know these things.
My role as advisor to the Arch-Mage is aided by knowing everything that transpires here.
Kind of scary if I think about it.
I think I've taught you everything I know. You might even be as good as me now.
Maven, I... please, don't hurt me.
I don't like being made a fool of, Brand-Shei. Not one bit.
Maven, please. I didn't know it was your man. Had I known, I would have looked the other way, I swear.
Turning him in to the guards? Have you joined Mjoll as official peacekeepers of Riften? You cost me a lot of coin.
Maybe later. I'm sort of busy now.
J'zargo continues to struggle with wards. You have time to practice?
J'zargo understands. You hesitate because you know J'zargo will be better than you. Very well.
No, Karita. I don't think I could.
Father, do you want to talk? About mother?
I'm sorry. I just don't feel up to entertaining anyone just now.
I'm sure she would want you to be happy, father. Entertaining the guests and drinking and making your lewd jokes like before.
Now go and make us some coin, lad!
May the shadows guide your journey.
Now go and make us some coin, lass!
Eyes open and walk with the shadows.
It was good speaking with you again.
Now that you mention it, there is.
I have a buyer with, shall we say, a very odd taste in literature looking for some particular books.
Now, now! That won't be necessary.
Now, on to the business at hand...
Well. Perhaps you'll at least consider it, hmm?
Oh dear, I hadn't thought of that.
Right, but if you plow the soil with fire salts...
Then you've salted it and nothing will grow at all. Genius.
Now, I've been reading about the best ways to grow corn in permafrost...
I keep telling you, without a warming enchantment, it will never grow past your ankles.
Oh, no it hasn't. Let's be honest.
But at least I know where to start now. Thank you, you've been a great help to me.
I have a long way to go before I'm ready for the kind of advanced magic I've been attempting.
Oh, not so confident now, are we?
Yes. This is a test. I don't think you're regular militia material. I want to see what you're capable of.
Really? Now that is interesting...
Then you should know that Louis and I have a certain... history.
Tell you what. Go along with his plans for now. I'll keep an eye on you both and, when the time is right, I'll settle accounts with Louis.
Really? That would be kind of you.
Here, take this bag of supplies. At the top of the steps you'll see the offering chest. Just leave the bag inside and you're done.
Retrieve that shield at all costs.
See you on the other side, mortal.
Shor's bones, I hope you're right.
Yes, Legate. No one is getting through us.
Brings back memories. Do you have any orders for me, Legate?
Keep the guard alert. I want to make sure no townspeople get hurt if there's trouble.
Just like old times, huh Horik? You and me fighting in a war over some forsaken scrap of land.
Sorry, fresh out. Maybe next time.
Absolutely. Did you still want to buy one?
Nothing but the best. Black-Briar Mead... fresh from the vat.
Best of all, you don't have to pay the ridiculous prices Maven charges. So what do you say to that?
Take your ease, let troubles fade.
A cup, Dragonborn, to death and glory!
But if you stray from wisdom then to Sovngarde you will not return.
The three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe.
Shor's high seat stands empty; his mien is too bright for mortal eyes.
Shor's power protects this hall; but beyond is fear, brought by Alduin.
I long to fight that foul worm, but by Shor's command we curb our wrath.
By Shor's command we curb our wrath, so we feast and sing, til the final doom.
Far you've travelled, your trials long, to taste of Sovngarde's sweet delights.
No gloom can hold my heart for long in Shor's bless'd hall, where no shadows lie.
Why does Shor forbid us to face Alduin? I fear no worm, World-Eater though he be.
Dragonborn! Have you come to cleanse Sovngarde at long last of Alduin's foul mist?
You freed Svaknir, a fool of a poet, but an honest enemy who has earned my respect.
Fate drives you, but you follow your own path. Choose wisely, lest you wander into evil.
Welcome, Dragonborn! Our door has stood empty since Alduin first set his soul-snare here.
Hail, Dragonborn. That honor is also mine - to our shared birthright you'll bring new glory!
My disciples still follow the difficult path - the Way of the Voice is neither wide, nor easy.
Do not fail Kodlak. He's earned his place here, and does not deserve to fall prey to Alduin's insatiable hunger.
Seek ye food or song unending? Fighting, drinking, fellowship and boasting? Find welcome here, and warm your soul.
Sadly, he's now lost in the soul-snaring mist - defeat Alduin, and his doom avert - I hope to greet him in this Hall as a friend.
Thank you. I will not forget this.
Thanks for bringing the claw back.
It means so much to us to have the claw back where it belongs. Thank you!
Thank you so much for taking care of those thieves. The Riverwood Trader is back to the way it used to be!
The prisoners just walk right out.
But every now and then, one swims back.
No surprise, but one of them's gotten out. Again.
Haafingar seems to have trouble keeping their prisoners in line.
But it seems their criminals can't either and just want to get out.
The braggarts in the Reach always claim that no prisoner escapes their mine.
The snowberries up in Winterhold have lowered themselves to ask for our help.
The Jarl has too much on his mind right now, we won't be troubling him with this.
I'm sorry to have to send you to Hjaalmarch. I can't stand the smell of it myself.
One of the guards from Dragonsreach came to me, worried about a prisoner who's escaped.
It seems that law-breakers in the Pale have no desire to stay there. I don't blame them.
It sounds like Eastmarch is too busy with their war to keep their own prisoners in line.
What you don't hear about are the ones who break off from escorts on the way to Markarth.
The idiots in Falkreath still think the best place for prisoners is that hole in the ground.
For some reason they just throw their lawbreakers out into the sea and think that ends the problem.
The so-called prison in Riften leaks like one of their fishnets. This is what happens when you let thieves run your town.
Then allow me to introduce myself.
Twilight watch over you, guardian.
Typical. Well don't mind me, then.
Umm... what were we talking about?
What's not to get? It's as simple as Traven's First Axiom of Magic... or was it Galerion's Law of Casting. Hmm.
I'll tell you what, let me find out where that's from. I'll need to look through my library... and get you an answer.
Very well. Keep at it. You may go.
How dare you take that kind of tone. You're in service to me, remember?
I'm sorry my lady. The stresses of all this research... it's becoming more than I can bear.
Sorry, my lady. I've been looking but I'm convinced Saerlund says truly believes what he is saying.
You're forgiven. Now, I want to know if you've made any progress with my son. Is he cursed? Has he been possessed?
Do you realize how delicate the experiment is you've interrupted by sending for me? I may need to throw out the components and start again.
We will be back. This is not over.
We're causing no trouble. All we ask is to look for her.
Look, you've already been told you're not allowed here. Turn around and go back the way you came.
I don't care what you're doing, after what happened you're lucky I don't toss you in jail. Now get lost.
What's become of the Skeleton Key?
I just wanted to give you a proper thank you for everything you've done.
The Guild is back on its feet again and on its way to a prosperous future.
Why are you bothering me, kinsman?
Why are you bothering me, outsider?
Why, why have you done this to us?
I cannot protect you if you murder us. This is the only warning you will receive.
Yes, sir. I'll try to contain her.
Captain, I've been receiving complaints about this Giordano woman.
See that you do. I will not let Windhelm descend into chaos over a few overactive imaginations.
I don't care if she can find a living dwarf -- I can't have her stirring up trouble. We have enough problems as it is.
Yes, sir. I've been trying to quiet her, but she's insistent. She thinks she can find out who's been killing the women...
You could trap him there, exactly.
You think Alva...but that means...
Ye gods! You think Alva is a vampire?
You'll be well paid for your time.
Head to the Riften jail and talk to Sibbi. Get him to tell you where Frost and his Lineage Papers are and bring them to me outside Riften.
Your payment, for a job well done.
Good. And I hope you were careful in that lumber mill. Those splinters and rusty nails can be quite nasty.
A boy's gotta make a livin', right?
Sometimes, when she goes to her room to work or sleep, I slip out for a bit. Noontime, every day - that's when I hit the streets.
A pity. And words I hear too often.
But there's no shame in it. One of them dragons comes callin' in Whiterun, the place'll go up like tinder.
A shame. Perhaps another time then.
A truly remarkable place, isn't it?
Kynareth humbles us with her beauty.
Praise Kynareth for allowing such beauty in the world.
Don't come any closer. I don't want Kynareth to think I'm on your side.
Amazing that such beauty could exist in a place as desolate as the volcanic tundra.
A very powerful family in Windhelm.
Wouldn't surprise me if they were in league with the pirates, somehow.
They run a private shipping operation, and would love to have the docks to themselves.
Ah, of course. I suspected as much.
Ah. Well, some other time, perhaps.
All right, I'll go kill this giant.
Unless, of course, you'd like to make some extra gold.
And I would deserve it, wouldn't I?
I know now that I can't live among people.
I can't stop you if that's what you want to do. Hircine is too powerful.
But if you spare me, I can be a powerful ally to you. And I would promise to never return to civilized life.
And what's that have to do with me?
Yeah, we're all looking for something.
I think you might be looking for Enmon.
Damn it, man, are you trying to taunt us?
Damn it, woman, are you trying to taunt us?
Oh, my. You'll want to talk to Enmon about that.
Oh, I... I'm sorry. I just can't... you'll have to speak to my husband.
I thought Enmon and Mean had a little girl, but I haven't seen her in a while.
As do I. It's a puzzling situation.
At this very moment? No. However...
I've made progress, but then hit a snag. I think perhaps you could help.
Well, I've been working on something. An improvement on the Ebonyflesh spell.
Be patient and your time will come.
As a Nightingale, I took an oath and was sworn to secrecy.
Been stuck with the name for years.
I've been ridin' horses since I was a lad... nothin' I liked more. But as I got bigger, so did my mounts.
Then one day, I was drunker than I've ever been and mounted a poor colt. Broke his back in two. Haven't ridden since.
Browse as much as you like, please.
Call upon me if I can be of any service.
Look around all you want, but don't try anything funny.
Hey! You planning to steal something? Don't even think about it.
But I digress. Here's your payment.
I hope the elf didn't give you too much trouble. I once got set on fire by a sorcerer. Nasty business, that.
But I insist. and with good reason.
Friend Brunwulf, how good to see you!
Just... know that your efforts are appreciated.
Oh, I see. Well, I'm sorry to have troubled you about it.
That's not necessary. I'll pay the same price as anyone else.
I'm not looking for special treatment, Aval. All I did was talk to Ulfric.
So few Nords have ever offered to help us, a discount is the least I can do.
If you see anything you like, just let me know and I'll glad offer you a discount.
For all I know, he's already forgotten the conversation. I wouldn't get your hopes up.
Malthyr told me that you've been speaking to Ulfric about our situation. He said you're going to help us.
But no, it is not in my possession.
I've seen enough to know their fabric. The warp of air, the weft of time.
By what right do you request entry?
No shade are you, as usually here passes, but living, you dare the land of the dead.
Cross the bridge at your own peril!
The way is dangerous, and the gate will not open. You shall not gain entry!
DO NOT RECORD - blank blocking info
Either way, it's off limits to you.
How should I know? I don't work for them.
And now that they've solved their little pirate problem, they're busier than ever.
Unfortunately, thanks to some problems they've been having, it hasn't seen much use lately.
This is the East Empire Company's central warehouse. All of their shipments go through here.
If you want to help, I suppose you could head to Windhelm and talk to Orthus Endario. He's in charge over there.
Even the Dragonborn betrays Skyrim.
What? And you call yourself a son of Skyrim?
What? And you call yourself a daughter of Skyrim?
Fine, I'll show you, you big bully.
Get away from me, you Skyrim trash.
Ugh. Speak to my husband if you must.
Go ahead and play your little joke.
I could learn a lot from the people in this room.
Isn't this something? Elenwen really knows how to host a party!
Have you tried the wine?  It's better than anything in the Blue Palace.
When I married Torygg, he promised we'd go to lavish parties just like this. I wish he were here now.
Good for him. For the both of them.
Between you and me, she could use a bit of warmth.
Calcelmo? Is he interested in Faleen? That sly old codger. I should have guessed.
Good. One less worry for my people.
How are your chores coming, my son?
But mother says you're a terrible innkeeper!
That's right! Worst innkeeper in all of Skyrim!
Ah, my son, you'll be a fine innkeeper someday, like your father.
Today I've cleaned the linens, washed the floors, and checked in on all our guests.
Never mind your mother, Hreinn. You listen to me, and you'll be a great man one day.
Hrmmm. Pick up your trash, fetcher.
Gah! Quit throwing your garbage everywhere.
There's a place for trash, and that's not it.
In my day, we knew how to dispose of trash properly.
Who does that? Who just leaves their garbage lying about?
Oh, by all means. Just leave your refuse wherever you see fit.
What's this? It thinks it can just throw refuse wherever it likes?
What kind of filthy barbarian just throws their trash on the ground?
And they call me a savage. Least I don't leave my trash lying around...
Really, the nerve of some people, leaving their trash wherever they please.
One person's trash is another's treasure. Don't be surprised if you find that gone...
Look at this one. Spoiled as a child, I'll bet. Allowed to leave trash just lying around...
What's the matter with you? You think you can just go dropping your junk wherever you like?
I never did understand the local custom of simply leaving one's trash wherever is convenient...
I swear, is there no end to these uncouth savages, just throwing their trash wherever they please...
I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers.
I forgive your not knowing my name. Few can hear my whispers anymore.
I tug at the web of connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal.
I can always count on you, can't I?
Good. I can always count on you, can't I?
I could never hope to approach her.
My mouth goes dry, and I start to shake.
The trouble is that I can't seem to speak around her.
I didn't mean... I'm sorry I asked.
Are you still working at the Bannered Mare in the evenings, Olfina?
And why shouldn't I? Just because I'm a Gray-Mane doesn't mean I can't earn my own keep.
I make sure Erikur keeps breathing.
I provide my wisdom and insight to the court.
It does indeed. You know, I hear you had something to do with Sybille Stentor's demise...
That must have been a hard bit of business. I hear Stentor had been alive for a long, long time.
I need you to do me a favor, Dirge.
Sure, Ton. You know I'm good for it.
Gladly. He won't bother you anymore, I promise.
There's a new guard nosing around the meadery. Can you do something about it?
I try to hold us to the right path.
If you seek either, you've found the right place.
Ask any fool around here, and get a different answer.
We bring honor and glory to ourselves and each other.
Are you looking to join? I wouldn't get your hopes up.
We're the best damned fighters in Skyrim. At least, some of us are.
A good bunch of men and women, who make too much a mess, if you ask me.
Why would you even come to Jorrvaskr without knowing what we stand for?
The Companions are my family. We fight so that other people don't have to.
They used to be something. Nowadays they just squabble amongst themselves.
You'll hear some of the brighter faces around here talk about honor and glory.
When we arrive, blood is spilled and our blades sing to the glories of Ysgramor.
Take my advice and keep away. You look too smart to get caught up with this bunch.
I've got nothing against it, but for me, the promise of coin is what feeds my blade.
Only the most famous warrior band in all of Skyrim. Have you been living with the horkers?
The short answer is: we fight. The long answer is... eh, forget it. You're not worth my time.
But he thinks everything used to be better. I, for one, would trust any Companion with my life.
Mercenaries. Warriors of honor. Brothers and sisters of the blade. Drunken rabble. Take your pick.
Wherever someone in Skyrim doesn't feel up to defending their own honor, we'll take up their burden.
To hear Vignar tell it, they're a bunch of layabouts and useless whiners who used to know how to fight.
This is not play-acting, here. We are the true spirit of Skyrim. Honor is in our blood, death in our hearts.
I've been here longer than most of them. Even I don't know sometimes. I just hope they don't kill each other.
The difference between a noble band of warriors and a ragged bunch of assassins is as thin as a blade's edge.
Your question carries more weight than you may know, newcomer. The sort of thing some of us spend our lives pondering.
I will entreat Mara on your behalf.
The village of Ivarstead. The woman, Fastred.
The dawn surely opens upon you, child. You must bear its light that all may see.
This is the prayer heard by the goddess and relayed to her servants. Return when she has seen her path.
Mara has reflected an image to me. At the foot of the throat and young woman... almost a girl... her fickle love must resolve itself.
I will train better for the future.
I am sorry if I disappointed, Harbinger. Still, the battle was won.
I wish you well friend. Be careful.
I work for Eydis. She runs the inn.
Changed the linens myself. They're fresh.
If you drink too much, you're out. No drunks.
You'll be looking to rent Tiber Septim's room I take it?
This is the Old Hroldan Inn. Clean beds and strong drink.
The Old Hroldan Inn is still open, bless poor Eydis's memory.
Old Hroldan is the stone that the Empire's history is built on.
You should head on inside. Eydis or Skuli can take care of you.
Skuli owns the inn with his mother gone, but I handle the rooms.
Skuli's father is off fighting for the Empire. I'm sure he's just fine.
Skuli's father is off fighting for the Stormcloaks. I'm sure he's just fine.
My mother's dead, but I won't close the inn. I've hired Leontius to run things.
Don't underestimate my son, Skuli. He may look young, but he can handle any drunks we get.
I'll bring a blanket and some wine.
Oh, that sounds nice. Yes, I think I'll join you.
I'm thinking of going for a walk up the mountain later. Would you like to come?
I'm afraid I didn't see anything...
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this.
Maybe so, but bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. Tullius needs to know I won't be pushed around.
Maybe so, but bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. We need to show Tullius we won't be pushed around.
I'm running low on Grand Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Petty Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Common Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Lesser Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Greater Soul Gems.
In any case, I have a task for you.
Is there some way I can assist you?
If, however, you seek something more, I will be happy to assist you.
I trust you found your journey to Winterhold not entirely unpleasant.
Welcome to the College of Winterhold. I am Faralda, one of the senior Wizards here.
Now, I must advise you that if your only purpose in being here is to complain, you would be far better off speaking with the Jarl of Winterhold.
It is a fine day to work the mines.
This metal will serve the forge well, my brother.
Just let me know when you're ready.
Sure, I don't mind taking some more of your gold.
I'll fight you again, but not until you have the gold to back up your bet.
Just tell me who needs bludgeoning.
But I'll follow the old man's lead. As ever.
Too confusing for me. Empire, Nords, Talos. Who cares?
There are always good reasons to fight. I just wish this war had them.
None of our business. There's no honor to be had in the squabbling of jarls.
Who cares who worships what dead god? Give me something to make me draw my sword.
Politics are something best avoided. I prefer more personal confrontations, myself.
Kodlak says not to worry about it. I worry that a bunch of snowberries are out there earning glory while we stay out of it.
Killing him was a bit... impulsive.
Actually, I admire how you handled the situation.
You kept your cool and you didn't kill him. That's the mark of a professional thief.
A true professional would have kept his cool and dealt with it a different way, but I'll let it go.
Lad, I know what you've been up to.
Lass, I know what you've been up to.
My honor isn't so cheap, outlander.
Well, for that much, I don't think Malacath would turn his scowl on me. All right, outlander. My axe is yours.
My previous champion displeases me.
It is time he is replaced - in the traditional fashion.
No more than I was already getting.
At least Balgruuf's men bathed regularly. These Stormcloaks always smell of ale and sweat, and their breath reeks.
Four of the guards have already decided they're in love with me. Two of the guards got into a fight over me at the tavern.
Not here. Out in the yard. Come on.
The old man said to have a look at you, so let's do this.
Just have a few swings at me so I can see your form. Don't worry, I can take it.
Not lately. Business has been slow.
He was very nervous, mentioned something about needing help.
Everyone who's anyone. Viarmo bought an apple the other day, said he was looking for a new student.
That I do. I had a messenger from Dragon Bridge stop here on his way to the Blue Palace, not too long ago.
At times. Jaree-Ra stopped by the other day. Told me to keep an eye out for him, see if any new people arrived in the city.
Not so sure of yourself after all?
At the end of the day, every warrior is alone.
Before you can stand next to your shield brother, you need to be able to stand on your own.
Now I've got to clean up this mess.
I love it when a plan comes together.
Good luck. I'll be here if you need me.
Remember to put in a good word with Maven for me.
Remember, you don't get paid until they're all dead.
Remember, Sabjorn will be needing a helping hand. Make it look good.
One more time in case I wasn't clear. You butcher this job and you'll be sorry.
Please hurry. The Captain of the Guard isn't patient when it comes to tasting time.
Now... what did you say you wanted?
Please forgive my earlier rudeness. I am so often interrupted by visitors wandering in, I can occasionally become quite savage.
Oh, for the love of Mara. What now?
Well? Is it done? Have you reported the fool to the guard?
Little fool's going to experience the hard reality of Skyrim justice, eh?
You need to report that crazy jester to the guard. He should be patrolling the road.
I thought we'd talked enough. Unless you've reconsidered my offer? That Cicero needs sortin'...
You can tell Cicero I'll be along presently. I just need to do a couple things here first, and gather my tools.
Ha! That'll teach the little jester to go bothering the decent, hardworking folk of Skyrim. Fool never should have come here.
Just need to gather my tools and finish up a couple of things. No worries - I'll see to Cicero, make sure that wagon gets fixed.
Only one more door left.  Hurry up.
I don't have time to talk. Keep moving!
Probably not, but it's worth a try!
And what, you think that'll solve all your problems?
We need coin, Ranmir, and you're not bringing home any.
Don't just walk away from me! Where do you think you're going?
And you'd have me do what, join the College and prance about casting spells all day?
To the Inn for a drink, of course! Where else could I even go in this gods-forsaken town?
Shor's bones, I might just have to!
I don't see these troubles as business. This is a labor of honor.
To bring Ulfric his rightful glory, I would hammer a thousand shields.
Skjor was looking for you, earlier.
So much wasted breath in that crew.
Heard you had a bit of trouble near Solitude last week.
We all have different means to glory, Stonearm. Well done.
Just those same ruffians I was bringing in for the Shatter-Shields.
I'm imagining you just standing your ground and letting them tire themselves out.
I'm telling you, it works. Let them ring their own ears on my shield, then scoop them up off the ground.
So. You're one of Ulfric's spies...
So. You're an Imperial spy... Interesting...
I can't deny the man is right about a few things...
My first and only loyalties are to my nephew, and to this city.
Perhaps we can find a way for both of us to prosper from this unfortunate discovery?
This war of yours makes it difficult for a resourceful woman to advance her interests.
I have no strong love for the Stormcloaks but I can't say I'm all that fond of the Empire, either.
But I've seen first hand what Ulfric is capable of, given the chance. Suffice it to say, he is no friend to Markarth, and no friend of mine.
Sorry, love, but I'm not a charity.
Stand back and behold my handiwork.
Is that all? My friend, you've come to the right person. You could say that causing a scene is somewhat of a specialty of mine.
Taking me up on my offer, eh? Good.
So, you've come to see me to sell or to buy? Hm?
Brought me more than some Firebrand Wine I trust?
What have you got for me today? Nothing illegal I hope!
I've got plenty of good merchandise for you. Take a look.
If you've got the time to sell, I've got the time to buy.
What brings you to Whiterun? Got some juicy goods to sell?
I promise you, I buy much more than simple silver trinkets.
So, did Delvin send you again or you here on your own this time?
Now I know you've come by for more than just a visit. What did you bring?
I'm assuming you're here for more than a social call. Down to business, eh?
Ah, you're back. I'm hearing good things about the Guild through the grapevine.
Been a while since I've seen you at the meadery. Bring me anything interesting?
I've been forbidden to deal with you until amends are made with the Guild. Sorry.
Come to sell me something special, or did you just want to look through my merchandise?
Crossing the Guild was a bad idea. I'll buy goods from you after you settle your accounts.
Let's see what you have for me today. Something simple to turn around for a profit I trust.
I've made a lot of new contacts thanks to you, and more contacts means more coin for everyone.
Ah, you're just in time. I got in a shipment of fine wares courtesy of the East Empire Company.
I've got all sorts of interesting things for you to buy, and I assure you they're of the finest quality.
I heard about what you did at the Guild all the way out here. Sorry, can't buy or sell anything from you.
In trouble with the Guild, eh? Well, looks like we won't be trading merchandise until you smooth it over.
Rumor has it you couldn't follow the Guild's rules, so we can't do any business until it's been worked out.
I'm always on the lookout for all sorts of goods. Bring me whatever you... well, [QUOTE]find[QUOTE] and I'll see what I can do.
Glad your here, I've been looking for some more merchandise to buy. Have lots of orders to fill and my clients don't like to wait.
Thank the Divines we survived that.
Those Forsworn were fierce fighters. Fiercer than I could have imagined.
Thank you Klimmek. That's too kind.
I thought you played wonderfully last night.
Perhaps when you're finished here this evening, we could...
You're sweet. I'm just not ready for that sort of thing right now. I'm sorry.
That I am. You know how to use one?
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Those eyes. All right, killer, go on through. But don't try anything. Madanach knows more than you think.
The gods will be the judge of that.
Then you are worth more to me dead!
Then you know what a beauty she is.
Then you're stupider than you look.
You better watch your ass around here.
Then we're speakin' the same language. Good.
They will sing stories of this day.
Get over to Windhelm. Tell Ulfric of our victory here.
Ulfric Stormcloak's head on a pike.
He's nothing more than a barbarian renegade, whose lust for power has cost the lives of countless innocents.
Do you think Ulfric really cares about Skyrim's independence, or the welfare or its people? I promise you, he doesn't.
We've received a desperate missive.
Well, I suppose he wouldn't mind...
Well, it's been described as an accident. I can't imagine it was intentional.
It was all before my time, you understand. I've heard the stories, the same as anyone else.
Do you remember what I first told you, about how not being able to control magic could destroy you?
He was a brilliant student, an accomplished wizard. Delved into magic in a way none had seen before.
I didn't simply mean it could kill you. The Augur's accident is another very real type of a life destroyed.
But, I think, he became too focused on just how much power he could acquire. That's what led to the accident.
I've never felt it appropriate to ask him about it, about how that must feel. Or, I suppose, if he can feel at all.
Something must've gone wrong, and he ended up in the state he's in now, fused to the energies that flow through the College.
What about being loyal to his wife?
I know, dear. He's a busy man, though, and loyal to the Stormcloaks.
I... I'm sorry, dear, I've got some other customers. I'll be back around in a minute.
I just don't know what to do anymore. He's hardly ever in the temple. I see him at breakfast, and that's it.
What did you do in Wolfskull cave?!
What weapon do you like, Harbinger?
Big swords should always beat little swords.
Brave hearts beat lesser ones. That's the decider.
When I was young, I favored huge swords, much like you. Hard to lift these days, but I still enjoy the heft of a good hammer.
What? No. No don't kill me. Please!
What? Who... what do you want then?
What? Why would he do such a thing?
Where am I? You! Out with it, then.
Why don't you go... sell something.
Can't. Got at least two rounds to go.
Please, come home. Just... Just come home.
Ha! Drink ain't gonna kill me. Not today, anyway.
Why? Because I'd rather be here trying to keep my only brother from drinking himself to death.
Why don't you just kill me already.
Yeah... That's not going to happen.
No need to get so... hostile. Just take it. Sounds like you need it more than I do.
Yes, but it needs to be kept quiet.
But he won't deal with me. Talk to him; see what it'll take to get my amulet back.
I may have entered into an... agreement with Enthir. He had something I needed, so I traded him something of mine.
It was a mistake, and now I want back what I gave him. It's an amulet that belonged to my family, and I never should've given it to Enthir.
Yes, can I help you with something?
You fool. You don't stand a chance.
You going to be at the inn tonight?
What's your wife think of your trips?
Not sure. Feeling like taking another trip.
They're none of her business, and none of yours either.
You're right. Sorry to bring it up.
Do you ever think about them, Esbern? The others?
The other Blades? No. Best not to think what the Thalmor do to their victims, my dear.
Your payment for services rendered.
Don't worry, my friend, I'll spare you the facetious quip about killing a defenseless old woman.
Infiltrating an occupied fort and making it out in one piece is nothing to joke about. Well done.
Your payment, my friend. Well done.
Ah, so the hunter came to know the fear of the hunted, hmm?
A little girl is dead because of me.
It's all on account of this blasted ring.
I tried to tell them, but none of them believe me.
Believe me, it wasn't anything I ever intended to do. I just... lost control.
Ah, so it's gold you're after, then?
You need only ask about. Plenty o' folk in Whiterun with too much fat and gold to be bothered doing anything for themselves.
And so slain the beast inside of me.
And lead the Companions to further glory.
I thank you for this gift. The other Harbingers remain trapped by Hircine, though.
And perhaps some day, you'll join us in that battle. But for today, return to Jorrvaskr. Triumph in your victory.
Perhaps from Sovngarde, the heroes of old can join me in their rescue. The Harrowing of the Hunting Grounds. It would be a battle of such triumph.
And you're worried about your shoes?
I hate it here. Those were my favorite shoes, ruined and for what? We never even made it to the wedding.
Wha... Your shoes? We get robbed by bandits, my clothes torn to shreds by some giant cat, our bodyguard eaten by a dragon...
When we get back to Cyrodiil, I swear I will hire an army of battlemages to come up here and set fire to the whole damned province.
Argonian Ale! I can almost taste it!
Because I have no wish to be harmed.
But before I fought, I had to train.
Easy for you to say. You get to fight.
Enough with the training. I want to go fight something.
No fighting just yet. Not till Skjor says so. We train now.
You'll do all right some day. Today you need to keep training, though.
But I'll see for myself soon enough.
This is no time to play the reluctant hero. You either are or aren't Dragonborn.
But now Skyrim is at Ulfric's mercy.
Well... By rights, she had a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim.
That remains to be seen. By rights, she has a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim.
The moot will meet and choose Ulfric as High King. With his troops in most of the cities, they have little choice.
That's the real question, isn't it? No one can deny Elisif has a legitimate claim to become High Queen of Skyrim...
By Sithis, now I am truly impressed!
To kill a pirate captain, on her own ship no less? Simply masterful!
But I'm sure you've got plenty to keep you busy right about now, hmm?
I'm afraid that concludes our business. You have exhausted all available additional contracts.
You've not only earned your payment, but my respect as well. And believe me, friend - that does not come easily.
Come on now, fight your own battles.
Not bad. Next time won't be so easy.
Now that's impressive. You're mightier than you look.
What do you think this is? We don't do battle with magic around here, new blood. Now come at me.
Deliver your report to Legate Rikke.
Are you prepared to make that commitment?
Changed your mind? Decided you want to soldier for the Empire after all?
I believe the Legate gave you an order. I expect you to follow it. Dismissed.
In joining the Legion, you'll be taking an oath binding you to the service of the Emperor and thus to every citizen of the Empire.
Did you hear all that noise outside?
It's just the market rabble. We should get back to work.
You there. If you're here to trade, step up to the counter.
Did you raise your prices, Carlotta?
I had to. The farmers are charging me double for the produce I sell.
Maybe, but they wouldn't taste as good as a loaf of fresh-baked pumpernickel.
Let me guess, they're saying it's because of this trouble with the Stormcloaks?
Exactly. Road patrols were cut in half because the Jarl needed soldiers. Now the bandits are bolder than ever.
They've been raiding the farms for food, and supplies are scarcer than ever. Maybe I should sell swords and armor, instead.
Easy, easy. Don't get up so quickly.
Faith? I don't have faith in anyone.
All I care about is cause and effect. Did the job get done and was it done correctly. There's no gray area.
Fine. I'm not dying without a fight!
Forgive me, I didn't mean to assume.
I've just been asked enough questions. I'm here to learn, not to explain myself over and over.
Glory only awaits those who triumph.
Ha. Another milk drinker crying about his effort.
And as Companions, our glory must always be hard-fought.
Good. Glad we straightened that out.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Better to stay out of sight and ply my trade with the Thieves Guild than risk a contract on my head.
If the Dark Brotherhood discovered I had been a Morang Tong, they would come after me with a vengeance.
He what? What are you talking about?
Why that jealous idiot. Thought he could just manipulate me into never seeing Sven again?
Thank you for telling me the truth. You should speak to Sven. I'm sure he'll want to thank you, too, for defending his name.
He'll answer any questions you have.
She'll answer any questions you have.
Try not to disappoint. Or to get her killed.
Try not to disappoint. Or to get him killed.
How could you possibly know about...
Please. My family means too much to me. Don't hurt them.
How goes the begging today, Brenuin?
The gods smile on them who show charity. Best you remember that.
Make it quick, then. I don't want your stink driving my customers away.
That's right, mock the town beggar like everyone else. But I've got a right to browse, don't I? I ain't hurtin' anyone.
I don't think that was a compliment.
I like you Una. You've got presence.
You like everyone Jorn. You'll make a good court bard some day.
I owe you a great deal, Nightingale.
Then... it's over and my death wasn't in vain.
I'll make sure it's sent right away.
I'm sure my mother can compensate you for it.
I'll draft a letter to Rythe. If you could have it sent to Cheydinhal for me, that would make up for your blunder.
Ingun, you clumsy fool! You've tainted our entire supply of Painted Troll Fat. You have no idea how hard that was to get.
I'm not sure what this is all about.
I'm so angry, I can hardly stand it!
Father promised me a new dress days ago, now where is it?
It takes a while to make a dress, Dagny. You have to be patient.
I'm going to tell father you said that. He'll tan your hide for sure!
All you ever do is complain about what you want. You're a spoiled baby.
But I don't want to be patient! I want my dress right now! Father promised!
Is there... something else you need?
Rexus will now give you two items which must be passed along to your superior.
By the almighty Divines. You've come. You've actually come. This dreadful Black Sacrament thing... it worked.
It's Karliah... her name is Karliah.
No, please! There's no need for that! I'll tell you everything.
Items? What items? Let me see those.
Well, at least allow me to reward you for your uncanny foresight.
Hmm. I'm not sure how you managed it, but these are exactly what I need to start my next set of experiments. Wonderful!
Just head north - you can't miss it.
Cross the river and then head north. You'll see it, just past the falls.
It's the capital of Whiterun Hold, the biggest and the best of the nine holds of Skyrim. But don't take my word for it.
Just follow the road north. When you get to Honningbrew Meadery, turn left and the road will take you to the city gates.
It's not far. We used to go to the market there every month or so, until the roads got so dangerous with the war and all.
When you get to Whiterun just keep going up. When you get to the top of the hill, you're at Dragonsreach, the Jarl's palace.
Let's just hope that doesn't happen.
Do you think the Forsworn will come here? I mean, if they attacked Kolskeggr....
Look, I'll make this simple for you.
When you make up your mind, come find me there and we'll talk about your future.
Mama, why are you and papa fighting?
You're closing the stall, and that's final.
What am I supposed to do? Never leave the house? You want that, Endon?
You want to give up now? Out of fear? Is that what we're teaching our daughter?
We're not fighting we're just.... Why don't I get you something to eat? Mama and papa will talk later.
No, and at this rate, I never shall!
I am close, so close! You must force him to see reason!
Enthir is once again holding out on me. He refuses to deliver yet another item absolutely essential to my work!
No? I daresay we don't have all day.
Still? If I have to wait much longer, you may need to just bury me here.
Nobody pilfers property on my watch.
My thanks for bringing this to my attention, citizen. Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
Nothing, until you choose to use it.
Then, well... you got a taste. Stronger, faster.
It doesn't last long, though. The blood of your foes can sustain you. If you're willing to feed.
Now, let's see what there is to see.
Mine? Oh no, the stone is yours. I simply need to borrow it a moment...
Sounds good. May I owe you for them?
Say, how are you going to sell all those fish before they spoil?
I have two more bushels for you, Marise. That should keep you well-stocked.
You know I can't tell you that. As soon as I do, and you have a few meads in you, everyone will know.
Steward Falk, I have a task for you.
I will make the arrangements, my Jarl.
There's no need for an apology, and you're right about the war.
Perhaps this is a matter best discussed with with the general in person.
A wise course of action, my Jarl. However, we have little food or water to spare.
My apologies, Jarl Elisif. I was thinking only of the importance of the war effort.
General Tullius does not run this city, Thane Erikur. Or have you forgotten your oaths of fealty?
General Tullius will never allow that. He's ordered all surplus food to be given over for the war effort.
I want to begin stockpiling food and water in the event we come under siege, and I would like you to oversee this work personally.
Submit and pay bloodprice, criminal.
We haven't forgotten your crimes, outlander.
Stop, outlander! You must pay bloodprice for your crimes.
There are no jails in an Orc Stronghold, criminal. You must pay in gold or blood.
Your crimes offend the Code of Malacath and we demand payment. Choose. Gold or blood.
By the Code of Malacath, you must pay bloodprice for your crimes. Which will it be, blood or gold?
Thank you. I'd almost given up hope.
That should do. Now - Inhale deeply.
Yes, yes. This will create a fine fume.
That's right. Turn around and leave.
This is not about your desires, lad.
This is not about your desires, lass.
This new armor fits me like a glove.
It pleases me to see you again, my patron.
Didn't think I'd be seeing you again so soon.
You're back! Great! Are we going on another adventure?
My patron appears once more. Have you need of my blade?
You're looking hale and healthy. It's good to see you again.
If you need some skulls crushed, I'm still available for hire.
If you've got the gold to pay my fee, then my sword-arm is yours.
I knew you couldn't stay away. Admit it, you were lost without me.
Well, look who it is. Been keeping out of trouble much? I hope not!
It's great to see you again! It's been too quiet without you around.
It's good to see you. If you need my help again, it's the same fee as always.
My skill in battle is unmatched. Fortunately for you, that skill can be bought.
Good to see you again! How would you like to hire a brave, if untested, mercenary?
Why hire a common soldier to protect you when you can have a master of the arcane?
If you're looking to hire the strongest mercenary in Skyrim, I'd wager your search is over.
Some call me a mercenary, but I like to think of myself as a freelance adventurer for hire.
Well, look what the horker dragged in. Still wandering all over Skyrim and causing trouble?
The only thing better than a powerful mage fighting at your side is... well, nothing, really.
By blade or by spell, if you want it dead, I'll make it dead. All you need to do is pay my fee.
It just feels right somehow, having this new life as an adventurer. It's what I was meant to do.
Sell-swords are common in Skyrim, but you'll find precious few as stout and as a strong as I am.
Well met, friend. It's good to see you're still in one piece, with all the trouble you get into.
I'm what you'd call of soldier of fortune. Make me an offer, and I just might fight at your side.
I know nothing of fear, and nothing of remorse. Pay my fee, and together we will vanquish any foe.
At first I thought I'd miss farming. I guess I've had my fill of it, because I don't miss it at all.
For a modest fee, I'll bring my formidable arcane powers to bear against your foes. What do you say?
Blade and shadow, silence and death - these are my arts. For a modest fee, I'll make great art for you.
Can't be too careful these days, with the war and other dangers. For a fair price, I'll watch your back.
If I can make enough money here in Skyrim, I think I'll travel to Hammerfell and see what work I can get there.
If it's a mercenary you're looking for, you've found him. There's no stronger sword-arm for hire in all Skyrim.
Sure, you can hire a swordsman or a spellcaster to fight at your side, but why not get both for the price of one?
I am a lethal instrument, yours to command for a modest sum. I suggest you hire me before one of your enemies does.
I fight with both blade and spell. You might say I'm equipped to handle nearly any threat. So, shall we talk price?
Versatility is the key to survival. Hire me, and you'll be well -prepared to face threats both magical and mundane.
Death is my art, and like all artists, I seek a patron. For a mere handful of gold, I will follow you into any danger.
I've fought in more battles than I've got years of life in me. Pay my fee and I'll put that experience to work for you, friend.
Trust like that is not freely given.
Gladly. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Sister to the Orcs.
Gladly. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Brother to the Orcs.
Wait... the Listener is serious? Oh.
Ha! Surely you're pulling Cicero's leg!
The Night Mother is part of you now! You get to hear voices inside your head! The rest of us should be so lucky.
Well of course the Night Mother will speak to you again! She might speak now, or later, or... I don't know! But speak she will!
We'll see about that. Won't we boys?
We're close now. I can see the camp.
It's just across the bridge and up that hill.
Well, now. This I hadn't considered.
If that's taken into account, these results make more sense.
Well, we have to cut down something!
I'll let you explain that one to the Nords.
They have to be reasonable about it at some point.
Well that's just it. Some of them might not be sacred.
Maybe we should just admit that this is a horrible place for a mill.
Wait, so you think we'll be able to harvest some of the sacred trees up there?
There is some good news though. I think the borders of the shrine may be smaller than we think.
Gemma. This town is called [QUOTE]Kynesgrove.[QUOTE] That stand of trees is Kyne's Grove. You don't honestly think you can just cut some down.
What news? Why isn't Fjola with you?
Until you can find out whether Fjola is here there's nothing I care to to discuss.
Why are you here? Did you follow me?
What I am doing is none of your business!
I demand that you leave at once and never speak of this again.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Yeah, sure it is. You don't fool me.
You are? Very good.... may I see it?
You have done admirably, little one.
They will become stronger for it. And you... You have proven your strength.
You have earned my favor for now, mortal, and so I give you a little gift. Use it well.
You have helped rid the Orcs of Yamarz in a way that avoids the destruction of their tribe.
You ready to pay the toll? One shiv.
You want to talk to the King in Rags? Fine. But first you got to pay the toll.
How about you get me a shiv? Not that I need one, but it's nice to have in case I need to do some [QUOTE]shaving.[QUOTE] Ha ha.
You tell J'zargo when you are ready.
J'zargo will give you scrolls, you will use them and report the results. This is a good plan, no?
J'zargo has worked hard on learning new spells, trying new things. This will make J'zargo stand out as a mage.
But J'zargo works so hard, there is no time to test these new spells. If you help with the testing, this will make learning easier.
You there. I have questions for you.
You were in Saarthal, yes? It has come to my attention that something was found there.
You used to love finding new places.
I still do. I just like to have food waiting for me when I come home.
And I found a new deposit of amber. Would have been nice to have some help pulling it out.
Verner, you should have come out with me yesterday. I found the most amazing tree growing right out of a cave.
You were born into the pack, sister.
You were born into the pack, brother.
You're interrupting the performance.
*Gasp* Finally, someone came!... I...
*coughs* The cat... *gasp* Ra'jiir... ambushed me. He's trying to take the sword back! I... can't... *gasp*
A rubbing, eh? Odd. I expected notes.
I suppose it would be inappropriate of me to ask how you obtained this, so I simply won't.
Adrianne. At her forge, just outside.
Tried making some myself, but I'm no good with the forge and anvil.
Anyway, our wares are strong and the prices fair. What else matters?
Since Adrianne's death, I've had to buy them from the Khajiit caravans.
Place is named after her. [QUOTE]Warmaiden's.[QUOTE] It's a childhood nickname, given by her father. What I hear, she was playing with swords even back then.
Ah, but there is a slight... problem.
Half of Skyrim knows. Old hag gets butchered in her own orphanage? Things like that tend to get around.
Oh, but don't misunderstand. I'm not criticizing. It was a good kill. Old crone had it coming. And you saved a group of urchins, to boot.
Ah, of course! How much have you got?
Alva? Didn't think she had it in her.
So Alva did it to get Hroggar for herself? I should have suspected her.
Because you are such a very nice Orc?
Before the Blades wiped them all out.
Oh, this was back in the days of Olaf One-Eye, thousands of years ago.
In those days, dragons could still be found among the remote mountain peaks.
Beware, beware, the Dragonborn comes.
Believe, believe, the Dragonborn comes.
I tell you, I tell you, the Dragonborn comes.
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart.
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes.
You'll know, You'll know the Dragonborn's come.
With a Voice wielding power of the ancient Nord art.
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows.
This is an ode to Skyrim's staunch protectors... the Imperials.
This one's a favorite of mine. A legend we all know and love...
This next song goes out to the Dragonborn. The savior of Skyrim.
This is an ode to Skyrim's truest sons and daughters... the Stormcloaks.
Dragonborn, Dragonborn, by his honor is sworn, To keep evil forever at bay!
Who was kin to both wyrm, and the races of man, with a power to rival the sun!
Paaz Keizaal fen kos stin nol bein Alduin jot, Dovahkiin kos fin saviik do muz!
Alduin, feyn do jun, kruziik vokun staadnau, voth aan bahlok wah diivon fin lein!
Fair Skyrim will be free from foul Alduin's maw, Dragonborn be the savior of men!
Alduin, Bane of Kings, ancient shadow unbound, with a hunger to swallow the world!
Nuz aan sul, fent alok, fod fin vul dovah nok, fen kos nahlot mahfaeraak ahrk ruz!
Sahrot Thu'um, med aan tuz, vey zeim hokoron pah, ol fin Dovahkiin komeyt ok rein!
Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, naal ok zin los vahriin, wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal!
This is a local favorite and one of the first songs I ever learned. Ragnar the Red.
All hail to Ulfric! You are the High King! In your great honor we drink and we sing.
Ahrk fin zul, rok drey kod, nau tol morokei frod, rul lot Taazokaan motaad voth kein!
Hearken now, sons of snow, to an age, long ago, and the tale, boldly told, of the one!
Huzrah nu, kul do od, wah aan bok lingrah vod, Aahrk fin tey, boziik fun, do fin gein!
Ahrk fin norok paal graan fod nust hon zindro zaan, Dovahkiin, fah hin kogaan mu draal!
But a day, shall arise, when the dark dragon's lies, will be silenced forever and then!
Mighty Thu'um, like a blade, cut through enemies all, as the Dragonborn issued his roar!
Wo lost fron wah ney dov, ahrk fin reyliik do jul, voth aan suleyk wah ronit faal krein!
Ahrk fin Kel lost prodah, do ved viing ko fin krah, tol fod zeymah win kein meyz fundein!
And all heard the music of Alduin's doom. The sweet song of Skyrim, sky-shattering Thu'um.
Down with Ulfric the killer of kings. On the day of your death we'll drink and we'll sing.
And the Voice, he did wield, on that glorious field, when great Tamriel shuddered with war!
But then came the Tongues on that terrible day. Steadfast as winter, they entered the fray.
We drink to our youth, to days come and gone. For the age of aggression is just about done.
We need saviors to free us from Alduin's rage. Heroes on the field of this new war to wage.
If Alduin is eternal, then eternity's done. For his story is over and the dragons are... gone.
We drink to our youth, and to days come and gone. For the age of oppression is now nearly done.
Alduin's wings, they did darken the sky. His roar fury's fire, and his scales sharpened scythes.
And if Alduin wins, man is gone from this world. Lost in the shadow of the black wings unfurled.
And so the Tongues freed us from Alduin's rage. Gave the gift of the Voice, ushered in a new Age.
And the fiercest foes rout when they hear triumph's shout, Dragonborn, for your blessing we pray!
And the Scrolls have foretold, of black wings in the cold, that when brothers wage war come unfurled!
We're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives. And when Sovngarde beckons, every one of us dies!
But this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean. Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams.
Men ran and they cowered, and they fought and they died. They burned and they bled as they issued their cries.
We'll drive out the Empire from this land that we own. With our blood and our steel we will take back our home.
We'll drive out the Stormcloaks and restore what we own. With our blood and our steel we'll take back our home.
By the gods! I assume you have proof.
I assume you have proof? Can't go making accusations like that without proof.
By the gods! What are you doing here?
The power of Mzinchaleft is mine! Begone from here!
Do I trust him? Not in the slightest.
Well, he's quite obviously mad. Whether or not that makes him dangerous is another question entirely.
Do you wish to aid in this cleansing?
These energies, on occasion, become... polluted. Effort must be made to see that they are kept pure, clean.
As you may be aware, the College has gone to great lengths to purify and enhance the natural energies of the world.
This both enhances our connection to the realm of magic, and eliminates possible interference from outside sources.
Don't be daft. Proventus is my eyes.
Just give me the letter. I presume once I have it, I can do as I please with it? Good.
Er, rather, have a nice day, citizen.
The, um, Emperor thanks you... Now shove off!
Finally, reinforcements have arrived.
I was expecting more though, you'd better be good.
Get it back, for the honor of us all.
Grelka, do you fancy a walk tomorrow?
And why not? I'm handsome, strong and smart. What else could you possibly need?
Odfel, I've told you time and time again. I'm not interested in a relationship with you.
I need someone that cares about me more than they care about themselves. That person isn't you.
Hah! I wish that I had your optimism.
I feel the same. I do not think Khajiit were made for the cold.
It has been a profitable journey, and yet I long for the warm sands of Elsweyr more and more each day.
Not only that, but these Nords have no love for us. They look upon us and see only thieves and smugglers.
It is a pity, but it cannot be helped. Perhaps if we continue to show that we can be trusted, they will open their cities to our caravans.
Have I told you about Valen, my dear?
He killed six Imperial Guards before they dragged him into the prisons.
I love when you spin that yarn. Gets better every time you add something new.
Was this before or after the Mythic Dawn attacked the Emperor and Valen single-handedly fought them off? Just shut up and drink, Romlyn.
Hm. I had not thought of it that way.
I wonder if we should offer discounts to the soldiers.
The soldiers? From which side, the Stormcloaks, or the Imperials?
Both. One or the other is bound to win the war eventually. Why not curry favor now, so that the victor will look upon us kindly?
Hah, you have the foresight of a Khajiit in a sandstorm. If we offer a discount to both sides, the winners will persecute us for helping the losers.
I did. Your time, it seems, has come.
Yes, and we have something special for you this time.
I doubt he'll be free, but all right.
I guess I expected too much from you.
Looks like I chose the right person for the job.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Nothing around here has been going well lately.
Just how long did you expect me to keep those people distracted? I had to let the whole plan fall through.
