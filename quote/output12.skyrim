I can't believe Gulum-Ei's mixed up in all this; that Argonian couldn't find his tail with both hands.
Have you ever heard of the expression, [QUOTE]the scale of the Argonian that bit you?[QUOTE]
No, I guess not. Well, the principle applies here. It's a potion, made from those dragon parts. Give it a try.
Here, I want you to have this. It was my father's but I'm certain you'll put it to good use.
I think things are going to be a lot different around here from now on and I have you to thank for it.
Oh I know. Isn't it wonderful? I bet she squirmed like a skeever when you pulled them out of your pocket.
Hrongar became the Jarl when his brother Balgruuf, who had the job before him, was murdered.
That'll be the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater. He's an honorable enough man. Never done wrong by me or my kin.
Balgruuf was an even-tempered man, but his brother's a hot-blooded war-monger who wants to settle everything with a blade.
Things are tough for him now, I'd wager. What with the fighting, and the dragons. But Balgruuf's a tough old Nord. He can handle it.
If you've got some business with Hrongar, mind you stay on his good side. The palace dungeon's filled with folk who roused his temper.
Is Vignar too old to be Jarl? It's a fair question. If he's grown infirm and is losing his wits, where does that leave the people of Whiterun?
Vignar the Revered is the Jarl in Whiterun. I guess he was a great hero once, because the Companions all call him [QUOTE]Vignar the Revered.[QUOTE]
I appreciate your help. Please, take this. Some gold I've saved up from working at the mill.
I can't imagine what that might be, but if it's safe, you might see if they were successful.
You could get some useful information about whatever they were up to. Sounds like it won't be of use to them now, anyway.
I don't know who told you that, but I'll do what I can. What we do have are plenty of books.
I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great import to Jarl Hrongar of Whiterun.
I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great import to Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun.
I need to get back to Markarth. Here, take this. It's the least I can do for saving my life.
I owe a great deal of money to someone and I think they cheated me. I don't know what to do.
I sent a blessing to Mundus, a wasting plague that infected a scattering of Breton villages.
I will not stand for betrayal. I want you to go to Bthardamz and kill Orchendor, in my name.
One of my monks, the elf Orchendor, was sent to gather these Afflicted. He shepherded them into Bthardamz for me, but has since lost his way.
If we could get into the Thalmor Embassy... it's the center of their operations in Skyrim...
Problem is, that place is locked up tighter than a miser's purse. They could teach me a few things about paranoia...
If you find anyone you think would make a good recruit, I can certainly take a look at them.
Remember, though, being a Blade is a lifelong commitment. Their loyalty has to be with us once they're in.
If you're not sure maybe you don't belong here. I'll ask again, are we clear on all of this?
It is the Champion of Namira! I was just about to eat. Here, you should have the first bite.
Jarl Brina Merilis is in charge, thanks to the Empire. Best hide any Talos amulets you have.
That would be Jarl Skald the Elder. He's over in the White Hall, probably talking about Ulfric like he's the second coming of Talos.
Listen, Roggvir and I grew up together. It was us, a few others and Vivienne. Vivienne Onis.
From that point forward, every time Vivienne and I were anywhere close to each other, he made sure to humiliate me.
He'd beat me up, dump mead on my head, anything he could get away with. Once he even slipped a beehive into my bed.
I have no idea why, but one day, I told Roggvir I liked her. It was a stupid thing to do... He mocked me incessantly after that.
We were children, sure. But Roggvir never outgrew that immaturity, or his cruelty. So any talk about him being an [QUOTE]honorable[QUOTE] Nord? Pure folly.
Look, I'm done here. Mop the floor with these idiots for all I care. Just get out of my way.
*Sigh* I was part of the gang in the ruins here. Friend of mine went crazy and stole the boss' sword. They blamed me for it.
Maybe a little influence from your old uncle Sanguine could help adjust your course a bit...
Let's be honest, here. I don't always think my decisions through.  But you... you're going places.
Mmmm, careful with that, Nenya, our merchants could be selling weapons to an invading force.
The trade routes are affected as well. Procuring supplies is a guessing game. Weapons sell well though.
Preparing the defenses is almost impossible lately, every time we get a new war report our needs change.
More importanly, he's pledged the full support of the Battle-Born clan to the Thieves Guild.
Olfrid sent ahead his compliments. Looks like his friend Arn is soon to be released thanks to his brand new identity.
No. I was too afraid to look. I don't know what we're going to do now. We have nothing left.
No. That was an ugly affair. High King Torygg's death has turned the whole town on its head.
And between you and me? He wasn't even that good a king. All of those rambling speeches about the Empire this, and the Empire that...
Not a student of history I see. It's for the best. They're a group that should be forgotten.
The only thing you need to know is that they almost destroyed the world, and they were stopped. A long time ago.
Not to mention the benefit of wards! How can they continually overlook wards! It's baffling!
It's quite simple really. There are some who shall not be dignified by being named, who have implied that it is not.
That is to say, it's been suggested that resources used for my study of Restoration could be put to better use. Any other use, in fact.
It's not just healing cuts and bruises, you know. The undead are a very real, very dangerous threat and Restoration magics can keep them at bay.
Oh, and one last thing. Here, I want you to take this. It's sort of a tradition around here.
After we're done here, head over to Tonilia and she'll set you up with your Guild Master Armor.
Well, that's it. Sorry if it isn't the ceremony you were hoping for, but we're not exactly known for throwing our coin around.
Oh... thank you. I don't understand what's happening. I can't stay here. What will I do now?
Present Ri'saad with this satchel of Moon Sugar, and I bet my last septim he'll make a deal.
Actually, I want you to bring him something. You see, the caravans are notorious for transporting illegal substances.
Sharp, aren't they? This was the last thing many saw before they were sacrificed in my name.
But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate it. So long since it's tasted blood. Until you came.
She's the Master-Wizard here. Arch-Mage Aren may be in charge, but Mirabelle runs the place.
So be it. If he believes it is necessary for you to learn this... we will bow to his wisdom.
Some old priest buried here long ago.  I've been searching for his tomb for a few years now.
That's a real shame. Gonna make it hard for you to pay a healer after we cave your skull in.
The circles at the base of the Ebonmere imbue you with powers befitting a Nightingale Agent.
The crescent moon represents the Agent of Shadow, the half moon for the Agent of Subterfuge and the full moon for the Agent of Strife.
The Jarl has put out a bounty on some bandits. Here, take a look at this decree for details.
The Jarl has put out a bounty to slay a giant. Here, take a look at this decree for details.
Then you're either a Stormcloak sympathizer or a fool. Either way, you're no friend of mine.
Things just go from bad to worse. First the war, now dragons... what's this world coming to?
I don't know why... but I actually believe you. You've got the look of someone who's just seen a dragon.
This is... lovely. Calcelmo wrote this... about me? I never knew he had such feeling in him.
Trouble is, my legs aren't what they used to be and climbing the 7,000 Steps takes its toll.
Well, it's kind of an understanding between us. I mean, it just wouldn't feel right to charge them for a bit of preserved food.
Very honorable, I'm sure, but you should not put your own honor above the freedom of Skyrim.
Very well. Here. Take this back to Brynjolf and tell him he'll have no more trouble from me.
Yes, because a worthless City Orc is just what we've been waiting for. Finally, we're saved!
Oh, of course! Because Malacath would take pity on us if only a useless outsider would lend a hand.
You do that, and I'll see what I can do about recruiting some new additions to our Family...
Now, might I offer some advice? You should go to Riften and find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before?
Mallory is an expert [QUOTE]obtainer of goods.[QUOTE] We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, hmm?
You said a whole lot of nonsense about selling Gleda to hire a priestess for some big event.
There was a bit of talk about some staff you had in safe keeping. Never said where, but you sure didn't have it with you!
You see, Riften is my great beast to be slain and my fortune comes from gratitude and trust.
You and I are alike. We seek challenge and great fortune. But for me, that's where the similarities end.
Many years ago I lost my blade, [QUOTE]Grimsever,[QUOTE] within a Dwemer ruin. I took it as a sign that I was wasting my days in search of wealth.
You there. Are you here to kill me? Slay the mighty Logrolf while he sits tied and helpless?
You're asking me? She promised that she was sending someone who knew what they were doing...
If you actually want to get out alive, I'd bring whatever you need to move quietly, and kill quickly.
And guess who owns the Silver-Blood Inn? Not that we named it that, the people just insisted.
My dear vagrant, we're the only family worth knowing in Markarth. We own everything in this city, even the jail.
As you can see, Eldergleam's roots are large and stretch far, blocking any path to her trunk.
Though, believe it or not, there are rumors of a weapon that even Eldergleam herself would lift her roots for, more out of fear than respect.
But I digress. Here, let me give you these. They are to be delivered to your, um... superior.
It's a shocking request, I know. But it is inside the purview of what you Dark Brotherhood types do. Isn't it? If history is to be believed?
You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now you're here, as if the very stars have finally aligned.
Calcelmo. He's the Jarl's magical advisor, but he spends most of his time studying the ruins.
If you want in, Calcelmo has to give his say-so. He's usually in front of Nchuand-Zel. Just down the tunnel.
Carry the blessings of Mara with you, so the rest of the province may shine with her glories.
Your efforts have helped illuminate the entire province. I trust by now you've achieved a higher comprehension of love.
Do... do you want something? Look, if you ain't gonna talk, or spare no coin, just go away...
Fantastic. I was concerned I had asked for too many, but I'm glad to see you proved me wrong.
Good question. I've only set foot inside a few times myself and that was in Mercer's company.
If you can get past his trained watchdog, I think your best bet might be the ramp to the second floor balcony in his backyard.
Ha! My opponent is so paralyzed with terror, no words will come. Let's be done with it, then!
Has he? I suppose he doesn't want to miss a chance to bluster about the Empire's many crimes.
Hmm. You may have a point. I'm always surprised by how seriously the Nords take these things.
He's probably hoping I'll refuse so he can blame the Empire for being unreasonable. I think I'll have to disappoint him yet again.
He even stole that locket right off that poor murdered girl's body... or what was left of it.
No! Linwe prefers stealing from the deceased. Digs up the corpses, breaks into the Hall of the Dead...
His shrine lies northwest of Largashbur. I am unsure that he will listen, but it cannot hurt.
I assume you saw the Gildergreen? Big tree, all burnt up, in the middle of the Wind District.
It's part of the Temple of Kynareth. People want Danica to do something about it, but I don't know what they expect.
I know how to mix a few basic potions, but I'm nowhere near as skilled as a master alchemist.
I've picked up a few tricks by reading the tomes scattered all over the shop, but I don't have the knack to pull half of the formulas off.
I might be old, but I haven't forgotten that a Jarl's first duty is to look after his people.
For one thing, I won't empty Falkreath's coffers to buy myself fine clothes an' expensive mead.
For another, I won't get mixed up with criminals and other sorts who take advantage of the honest folk for profit.
I oppose tyranny. I oppose those who tell me how to live, what to think, and what to believe.
I'm a man. Skyrim is man's homeland. That's a fact. A fact I'm proud of. There's no shame in that. Read your history.
I suggest you learn more on your own. Come back once you've attained some measure of success.
Just that, I'm afraid. You lack the ability, in any school of magic, to contribute meaningfully to the College's research.
I thank you. Here, please accept this as a token of my appreciation for your selfless action.
We've made peace with one another without even uttering a single word and I'm content for the first time in my life.
I felt a caress on my cheek some time ago... I thought it to be a trick of the wind, but I think it was a message from my father.
I'm told they're the ravings of a madman... a wizard named Arondil and his peculiar cravings.
It's said to be spread across four volumes and very hard to come by. My client is offering quite a reward for them, which I'd split with you.
If the stones were remounted on the crown, it would be of great benefit to the Thieves Guild.
When I told you the set had to be complete, I left out a small detail... I honestly didn't think you'd ever get this far.
No doubt he thought it was the only way to make his point. And also because he knew he could.
No. I can't risk weakening the city while we are under the threat of enemy attack. I'm sorry.
Oh, my! You? It is an honor! Your food has opened my eyes to the wonders this world can hold.
I've cooked every dish in your book, and I must say your brilliance is inspiring. My technique surely doesn't even approach yours... but whose would?
Oh, this was thousands of years ago, before the Akaviri crusaders cleansed Skyrim of dragons.
Skyrim's mountains were still infested with dragons. One of the early Nord kings caught a dragon and kept it in Dragonsreach.
Perhaps that is what you are meant to believe. To better serve your role as Azura's champion.
Do not fight it. Azura's prophecies always come to pass. To deny them is to go headlong into the darkness with no light to guide you.
She's an absolute pleasure to work for! In fact, I almost feel guilty accepting pay from her.
Why, just this last week I was commenting to my fellow meadery workers just how lucky we are to be working for such a charitable family.
Smithing isn't the most exciting thing for me, but we all have to lend a hand as best we can.
If a Stormcloak uses one of my swords to strike down an Imperial soldier, then I've done my part to free our land.
Tell you what. Keep to your word, and I'll line your pockets with as much as I can scrape up.
That's right. An Orc stronghold. Kept to ourselves. Lived as our ancestors would have wanted.
Wasn't enough for me, though. I left. Didn't want to end up as the third wife of some lowly chieftain.
Then I say well met, friend. I could tell you were a sharp one the moment I laid eyes on you.
Then it appears the shadows shroud more than your presence... they blind your wisdom as well.
Our actions have always been one in the same; both of us lie, cheat and steal to further our own end.
There's a whole college up in Solitude where they teach the arts. Song. Lute-playing. Poetry.
I studied there myself. Had to leave over a misunderstanding with a headmistress. Well, more a misunderstanding with her husband.
They don't make finer steel anywhere else. If this doesn't keep you from dying, nothing will.
They're able to grind it down so fine that it can be infused into the lattice of packed snow.
The ivory produced by those beasts is as hard as iron. But the giants have found ways to make it yield.
The finished material has the delicate nature of fresh powder snow, but the strength of the hardest steel.
This is the resting place of Ysgramor. And his most trusted generals. You should be cautious.
Turns out you're a screw up like the rest. But I still need you. So I'll overlook it for now.
I'm disappointed in your failure. But the Empire still needs you. I'll have to over look it for now.
Very well. It's not something often discussed, as it might be... misunderstood by the locals.
The Augur is down in the Midden, below the College. I don't recommend going down there unless it's absolutely necessary.
Well, my friend... the time's come to make it official. It's time to become our Guild Master.
Don't worry, I promise this will be short and sweet. If you'll just meet us in the center of the cistern room, we can begin.
What you have already learned in a few days took even the most gifted of us years to achieve.
A few mortals are born with similar abilities -- whether a gift or a curse has been a matter of debate down through the centuries.
Dragons have the inborn ability to learn and project their Voice. Dragons also are able to absorb the power of their slain brethren.
Some believe that Dragonborn are sent into the world by the gods, at times of great need. We will speak more of that later, when you are ready.
What? That little tease! Leading me on and turning cold at the last minute. I don't think so.
Why did you... nevermind, it's a sign. I'll return to temple. Here's something for your help.
Yes... quite. But if that power could be harnessed. Controlled. The possibilities would be...
But... who exactly are you? And why are you in here? I think it best you leave Mzinchaleft. These ruins can be quite... dangerous.
You look like someone who can hold their liquor. How about a friendly contest to win a staff?
And everything is made of stone. Even the beds. We'll have no trouble from dragon's fire here.
Yes, I know. We have some advantages if they come here. The city is built into the mountainside, so it's hard to reach into even from the skies.
Are you kidding me? Vex lost them in seconds... once she steps into the shadows, she vanishes.
Me? I ran... and I ran... straight through the gates of Windhelm and all the way back to Riften.
Arnleif and Sons Trading Company. I'm a porter. Just some muscle hired to move heavy packages.
But we don't get any shipments in. Forsworn attack every caravan. So all I do is sit here and drink.
But I never knew if nights-end brought victory - a swift-flying arrow to Sovngarde carried me.
Near Giants' Gap, in the gloom before dawn, we marched, unsuspecting into the Imperials' trap.
Then we stood and fought, our shield-wall defending until by dawn's light the Legion's ranks wavered.
Did you find the Elder Scroll? What happened when you took it back to the Throat of the World?
Don't have to tell me twice. But then, I'm not the one that buried iron under these mountains.
Here. Take a look for yourself. But give it back soon. It's almost time for milady's medicine.
I suppose so. But believe me. Only us servants have a key like that, and its a very expensive looking lock. Really, I wouldn't worry about it.
I don't believe it. I made that bow myself. Been through some messes with it, let me tell you.
You know what? I want you to keep it. My great hunts are behind me, but yours are yet to come.
I don't dare show my face, lest they recognize me, so you'll have to find out where they are.
They're mercenaries, only in it for the money. They're led by a man named Kematu. Get rid of him, and the rest will scatter.
I swear, you people are an odd bunch. Please, just step aside, that I may return to my duties!
I'll carry on his tradition as best I can. I could spend a lifetime just going over his notes.
I'm sorry to hear that. If you change your mind, speak with Galmar. What does bring you to me?
If you'd allow me to indulge myself for a moment, I thought I might make a few observations...
I just can't seem to tear myself away. Whatever this is, its beauty is like nothing I've ever seen before.
Is that a threat? Back off, or by the Eight I'll cleave that arrogant head from its shoulders.
It does. The College has caused enough problems; don't need you or anyone else adding to them.
If you're not here for the College, then you've little other reason to be in Winterhold at all.
It was the Kel - the Elder Scroll. They used it to... cast him adrift on the currents of Time.
The Nords of those days used the Dragonrend Shout to cripple Alduin. But this was not enough. Ok mulaag unslaad.
Yes and no. Viik nuz ni kron. Alduin was not truly defeated, either. If he was, you would not be here today, seeking to... defeat him.
Just do whatever the contact wishes. Be professional, represent us well, and get the job done.
Since it's your first contract, I'll let you keep whatever Muiri pays. She'll be generous, I'm sure. They always are.
Look, I'm getting out of here. Normally, spiders make my skin crawl, but magic spiders? Blech.
My choice, hmm? All right, then - tomatoes. Simple, yet infinitely flavorful. Don't you agree?
Well, I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?
My Saffir doesn't like that I've been spending so much time looking for my father's old sword.
We have not faired well outside our native Black Marsh, but we're determined to make the best of things.
He fed his entire family with the gold he made using that weapon. I'm not about to let it gather dust in some thief's trophy room.
I began praying to Zenithar, the god of wealth, to bring us some fortune, but thieves made off with my sacred amulet almost as soon as I bought it.
No. I was just buying jewelry for my sister in Cyrodiil. I've never even seen that man before.
No. I was just getting some fresh air. Had one too many pints of mead at the Silver-Blood Inn.
Now he's in the Emperor's pocket like the rest of 'em, with no regard for honor an' tradition.
Aye, they're an old clan like ours, but they cast their lot with the Empire when the uprising began.
Olfrid Battle-Born made his money from farming, an' got himself some new friends among the Empire's nobles.
Oh yes, many times. But mighty Talos was my keeper, my shield against the heresy of the south!
If not for Talos, and a few modest bribes paid to the right jailors, why, I would not be standing before you today, resplendent in my faith!
Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend. Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have nothing more to discuss. I encourage you to take your time and enjoy yourself. You look like you could use the rest.
Oh... yes... um... thank you. Here you go. Some gold for your assistance and your, discretion.
Old fort. Abandoned for years. They're like jackals, making their home anywhere they can find.
The Silver Hand have taken over the old fort at Gallows Rock. They always make such easy prey.
Thank you. I can't stand the thought of being trapped in this village for the rest of my days.
That's about the truth of it. Write tales about the sights I've seen. The battles I've fought.
Earned quite a name for myself when I was younger. The Bards College still teaches some of my work to their students.
That's when the fun starts. You'll have to slip away from the party without raising the alarm.
Then you'll need to find Elenwen's office and search her files. Malborn should be able to point you in the right direction.
The dwarves were very clever, tapping into and drawing power from the Heart of Lorkhan itself.
Without boring you with the, ahh, details, I am attempting to re-create the circumstances of the event.
Lacking the heart of a dead god myself, I was attempting to substitute a rather specific soul gem. The ahh, the one you helped me acquire.
They grabbed me in the Ratway. The nerve of these bastards... they need to be taught a lesson.
Hey, haven't I seen you around the Flagon? I never expected to see another Guild brother down here.
They grabbed me in Riften. They seem to think I know something. They just kept asking me the same damn questions.
Vex just tells me to run, so I did. Half of them went after me, the other half went after her.
Well it was, up until the point where we set foot outside. The house was surrounded by town guard... the client had ratted us out.
We should be careful. There's no telling what traps and wards the ancient Blades may have set.
The Akaviri blood seal can only be opened with the right kind of blood. Your blood, Dragonborn.
The entrance must be past the Forsworn camp. Look for a canyon or cave entrance into the Karthspire.
Ah, yes. The entrance seems to be near what's now known as the Karthspire. We'll have to see what we find when we arrive.
We should tread carefully. I wouldn't be surprised if he's left behind a few surprises for us.
Welcome, sister! I'm glad that your eyes have finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.
Welcome, brother! I'm glad that your eyes have finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.
Were the Greybeards any help? Did they know this anything about the Shout used against Alduin?
Yes, my friend. Though no one has been able to get close to her for as long as I can remember.
Yes, well. After the unfortunate incident that occurred, I think it's best if we just move on.
You know, I'm almost beginning to like you, but you haven't earned your place out of here yet.
You will find him holed up at Knifepoint Ridge, where he plays king to bandits and highwaymen.
You've disgraced yourself and our cause. You are no longer fit to be known as a son of Skyrim.
You've disgraced yourself and our cause. You are no longer fit to be known as a daughter of Skyrim.
About the same as everyone else. They're the cat-folk of Elsweyr. Great warriors, good traders.
Way I hear it, Elsweyr ain't nothing like Skyrim. It's got tropical forests and dusty badlands. It sounds awful!
Ah, the immortal plane. It is said to be the source of all magic. This is a noble goal, indeed.
And why would you be looking for me, hmm? I'm not sure I appreciate your presence here. Friend.
Any resident of Solitude can tell you, she was the deadliest person ever to come out of Skyrim.
She was always so close to being Empress, but despite her machinations, it was never to be hers.
Ironically, if she were alive today, she'd be the only living member of the Septim bloodline. By all rights, she would now be Empress.
A curious figure. Unrepentantly evil and nasty, of course, but also astonishingly brilliant, and obviously quite a necromancer at her end.
After twenty years of fighting, she had raised armies of the dead, led by vampire generals. If she returns to power, nobody could stop her.
Queen of Solitude, granddaughter of Emperor Uriel Septim II, five hundred years ago. Her fight for succession nearly tore the empire apart.
But there's a Khajiit hanging around the main gate. I didn't like the way he was looking at me.
Thank you! Here... I stole a lot from the Thalmor over the years. You may as well have some of it.
That's... great news. I'd... I'd better go. Right now. Before they find me again. This is my chance.
I'm sure he's Thalmor. Just waiting for me to leave so he can follow me and kill me in a lonely place.
I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere,that is.
I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere, that is.
Come see me in Solitude when this is all done. The Emperor can always use another good soldier.
Drop it off and he'll trade you something for the delivery. Keep it as payment for the legwork.
I need someone to take this small keg of Black-Briar Mead to Wilhelm at the Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead.
Oh, and if you bump into Indaryn from the meadery, keep your mouth shut. He'd rat us out in a second.
Every day is a struggle, but a Nord doesn't back down from a fight when the cause is honorable.
Unfortunately, a sword can't repair damaged buildings, feed hungry people or undo years of prejudice.
I just wish things were simpler. In my days as a soldier, I knew who the enemy was, and how to defeat him.
Every year, I sell more Honningbrew and Maven loses customers. Know why? My mead tastes better.
Maven Black-Briar's gone out of her way to try and have me shut down, but fortunately I have a good relationship with Whiterun's Jarl.
Go and slay one of the beasts. It should let them know that Dawnstar is not to be trifled with.
Giants are a common problem in the Pale. The Empire always demanded I leave them be, but the Empire isn't here now.
Hard to say. It's ancient, that much we know for sure. It was here long before the town itself.
Could be if one side wants to keep the other from coming across, they might try to knock it down.
I just hope the bridge survives the war. It's the only place you can cross the Karth river for a long way in either direction.
Have you seen Astrid? She needs to speak with you. It seemed urgent. Come talk to me afterward.
He now serves us honorably as Thane, and to the great benefit of the hold, I now serve as Jarl.
My uncle Dengeir was Jarl until a short time ago. His old age and failing health caught up with him, and he stepped down.
Hjerim? Well, I'm not sure what you think you'll find there, but you're welcome to have a look.
I don't know how, but he lives. I get his messages, and I hand out his orders without question.
Because my king told me to. Madanach. When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines.
I saw you working the forge today, wife. Your muscles have grown strong from the metal shaping!
No more talk of Shel. As chief, I will do what I please, so point your fiery gaze to our enemies.
Do they, my chief? Am I now favored enough to replace Shel by your side at the feast? Back your words with action!
I see. Then there's nothing further to discuss. If you change your mind, speak with the Legate.
I will do nothing of the sort. You have no business here. I'm sorry, but you really must leave.
I'll admit, I'm having trouble coming to terms with all of this. I'll just follow Nazir's lead.
I'm not Madanach. I was never a leader of the Forsworn. The only anger I can justify is my own.
But every family in the Reach has a story like mine. There are no innocent onlookers in this struggle. Just the guilty, and the dead.
I'm sure you can figure it out on your own. If you can't, perhaps Urag has a book you can read.
If I were you, I'd pack up and get out of here before you end up in one of those burial cairns.
Are you serious? The war is tearing the land apart, the dragons have returned seeking who knows what... Skyrim is going nowhere fast.
If you've got an axe, you can always make gold chopping wood. Just bring me everything you cut.
Ingun, how much longer do you intend to waste your life concocting your foolish little potions?
I've told you, my interest in the family business is quite low. I wish to be much more than just a merchant.
Your interests lay where I wish them to lay otherwise my favorite daughter may end up homeless and without a septim to her name. Is that clear?
It's quiet for now, Dragonborn. Perhaps later we'll find where one of those serpents is hiding.
Just ask whenever you're ready to take on a dragon. We will send the Blades to help you fulfill your destiny.
Only you can truly defeat these monsters, Dragonborn, but you do not have to do so alone. The Blades can help you.
I am. The Blades of the 2nd Era hunted down many dragons in their day, and they have records of where the beasts lived.
Jarl is who you want to talk to. Always coin to be made killing off some Forsworn in the hills.
As long as you don't mind going axe-to-axe with a bunch of Daedra-worshipping savages who practice the dark arts.
Join the forces mustering outside of [CAPITAL]. (Infos conditioned on Capital location go here)
Let him know that we've unearthed something... Well, I'm not sure. Something unique, let's say.
It's clearly magical in nature, but like nothing I've ever seen before. He should be most interested.
Listen, when you're ready to do something useful, find me outside Haemar's Shame, in Falkreath.
My name is Eorlund Gray-Mane. I work the Skyforge. Best steel in all of Skyrim. All of Tamriel.
Not actually a Companion myself, but none of them know how to work a forge properly, and I'm honored to serve them.
No, not that kind of spell. Believe me when I say I wouldn't be asking if it weren't necessary.
No. She said my part was over. That my fate had moved beyond the Twilight, and I was on my own.
I will tend Azura's shrine when you do not need me. I still have my duties, but for the first time I feel... alone.
Nobody trusts those mages, way up north in their college. Gods only know what they do up there.
Now, of course I must ask... Killing the Emperor... How much did Motierre pay for such a thing?
Could you have brought us more wondrous news? Recent events notwithstanding, this is a happy day for us, my friend.
Despite your misfortunes, you stayed true to the Dark Brotherhood. You've saved us all, and for this you have my eternal thanks.
Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend.  Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?
You are in Eldergleam Sanctuary - just a small glimpse of what beauty Kynareth has to offer. Wonderful place, isn't it?
Oh, really? You're just like my brother. Fine, but if you change your mind, I'll be right here.
Other than that, watch your footing. In these wintry conditions, the stairs can be treacherous.
Well, there's the occasional wolf pack or stray, but that's all I've ever had to deal with. Shouldn't be a problem for the likes of you.
Save him. Let him perform his rite one more time. And when he does, we will be waiting for him.
Revenge? No. I want submission. I want the priest who did this to bend his knee and give me his soul.
He comes by to perform Boethiah's insulting rites at my altar, but he's been missing. Captured and bound. Left to rot.
Sorry, Marise. I just can't sit back and watch them treat us like a resource. This is our home!
I can't stand them, they represent everything I hate about Skyrim. They're tearing the place apart!
Dravin! One of the soldiers I spoke to on the way home said you threatened them. What's come over you?
I don't care! Just stay away from the soldiers and keep to your business. It's the only way we'll make it through this.
All you'll accomplish by threatening them is ending up in the Riften dungeon. You're lucky they didn't take you seriously.
That is where your job ends and mine begins. The work of the mind, sadly undervalued in Skyrim.
The Augur was a brilliant mage. Truly inspired. Mastered spells others could barely comprehend.
He was especially gifted when it came to Restoration. He's... Well, he's very particular about who shares the knowledge.
So you'll need his approval first. Go on, go talk to him. I'm sure he's been paying attention, and will be expecting you.
Then I'm afraid your suspension will stand for now. I'm sorry, but that's the way it has to be.
Then you've found your home, friend. Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth. Welcome.
Think he worked down at the smelter. Lot of the laborers there are sympathetic to the Forsworn.
They promise people they'll kill off all the Nords that rule over the Reach. Nothing but murderers and saboteurs.
This is all just too much, too fast. Go get some work from Nazir. I need time to... to think...
Trust me, there's no place better to forge relationships with the movers and shakers of Skyrim.
The Empire is fortunate to have the support of the Thalmor during this difficult time, don't you think?
I don't understand why General Tullius hasn't been recalled. The man is clearly incompetent. I have half a mind to tell him so myself.
Mark my words, the war will be over in a matter of months. Once Ulfric sees the full might of the Empire, I'm sure he'll come to his senses.
Trying to stay ahead of the Thalmor assassins. I'm not a hero like you. I don't stand a chance.
Used to have their own kingdom, till the Nords came, now they're at the bottom of the hay pile.
They just call themselves the people of the Reach. Lot of common blood with the Bretons, by the looks of them.
Welcome to the family, lad. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me.
Welcome to the family, lass. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me.
Well, look at the evidence. Nords generally don't trust magic, so it's not off to a good start.
And finally take the fact that the College is the only thing left standing after most of Winterhold was destroyed. It's all fairly damning.
Throw in the Oblivion Crisis, which was caused by magic-users, and the troubles now with the Aldmeri Dominion, who are elves and magic users.
Well, maybe that's not entirely true, but our clan's got a long an' proud history in this hold.
We've got an old saying -- the Gray-Manes have lived in Whiterun since the first snows fell in Skyrim.
We respect the old ways, the Nord ways, an' a Gray-Mane has worked the Skyforge since before the time of my grandfather's father.
Winterhold has lost much of its history, and with that much of its power. I aim to change that.
I've heard rumors of the resting place of the Helm of Winterhold, the very same helm that Jarl Hanse wore in the First Era.
Hanse was in line to be High King of Skyrim, you know. Having that might get the ear of the other Holds and give me some authority.
Yes, but I need a show of loyalty from you. I don't need a shiv in the back while we break out.
You're a traveler, right? I have this letter for him. Let him know how much of a failure he is.
That's right. Old inn to the south. The oaf doesn't even bother to visit these days. What am I supposed to do if the dragons burn down the farm?
Your superior and I were simply having a... discussion about my level of access to the College.
After all, repentance is something you deny to Paarthurnax by meting out your so-called justice.
The same could be said for any of us, could it not? Are you so guiltless as to stand in judgment upon Paarthurnax?
Listen to your inner Voice before acting. Do not allow the Blades to bully you into doing something you will later regret.
After you're done with all this, come back anytime, and I'll make good on my end of the bargain.
Linwe is holed up at a place called Uttering Hills Cave. He's got his entire Guild there, so be careful.
All I need is a messenger to bring Her words to these poor souls by distributing these missives.
Riften is drowning in a sea of sin and wickedness and it's my personal mission to let everyone know that the warmth of Mara can see them through.
Are you a fool? Look at the bodies around you. Even if you're blind, surely you smell the blood.
Best of all, he's also pledged to open doors for us in Solitude and to get things rollin' again.
Erikur assures me that Captain Volf will spend pretty much the rest of his life clapped in irons.
But there must be more to it than that. Did something... strange... happen when the dragon died?
There's no question about that. It was a mighty deed. You've earned a place of honor among the heroes of Whiterun.
But you can bet he'll be trying to figure it out. This could shift the whole balance of the war.
If you want to help stop that dragon, your best bet is to go to Solitude and join up with the Legion.
No. Not yet. After all, a dragon... something out of old tales and legends... no one could have expected that.
But you can hear me, obviously. Something still isn't quite right. At least I'm making progress.
Dear sister. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated.
Dear brother. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated.
Easy, huh? So, should I just hand you purses of coin or are you going to work to earn your keep?
If something's being handed to you on a silver platter, then there's a catch... steal the platter instead. You get it?
Let me give you a small bit of advice. Nothing in this line of work is easy. If it was, every dreg in the Ratway would be robbing Riften blind.
Everything that represents Nocturnal's influence is contained within the walls of the Sepulcher.
Now it seems Mercer's broken his oath with Nocturnal and defiled the very thing he swore to protect.
I have a family heirloom you can have. Supposed to be sort of valuable. I hope that's all right.
I'd be glad to help a friend of Hadvar. But you didn't answer my question - how do you know him?
I'd like to know why you're wasting time asking about it when you should already be on your way.
I wouldn't bother smacking at those hives with a weapon. Set 'em on fire and they'll go up like kindling.
Watch yourself out there. The mercenaries Aringoth hired are trained killers. Just ask our poor little Vex.
The honey they collect on that hunk of rock goes into making Black-Briar Mead; just about the best tasting mead in all of Skyrim.
I'll give you a few more minutes. I can't wait here all day. It's my neck on the line, remember.
I'll go back to the Orphanage in a while. I'll give them time to, you know... clean up the mess.
When I grow up, I'm going to be an assassin. That way I can help lots of children, just like you.
I'm sorry to hear that. I thought your eyes had finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.
I'm sorry, but you've been suspended from the College. I can't be seen talking to you right now.
You've been suspended from the College for what you did. You'd better talk to Tolfdir if you want to get it sorted out.
If Nocturnal was truly displeased with me... with any of us, she wouldn't have answered my call.
I have no doubt that we still hold her favor and I believe it gives us enough of an edge to defeat Mercer Frey.
If you do good works for the people and purchase a home from my steward, I'll name you my Thane.
I'd like to offer you a place in my court, as a Thane. It's mainly an honorary title, but there are a few perks.
Now, by law and tradition, I can only grant the title to one who is known throughout Eastmarch, and who owns property in Windhelm.
If you're looking for a good attitude go see the Bards. They'll fake it for you if nothing else.
In fact, if you could retrieve a few things for me, I could start on my next set of experiments.
Well, at any rate, organization is not my strong suit. Not at all. I need as much help as I can get.
Yes, I could use some help with that. An assistant perhaps? No, no, no. Maybe a familiar. No, too messy.
It's called [QUOTE]Nettlebane.[QUOTE] The hags terrify me, or I would have gone after it myself.
You'll have to deal with the Hagravens. I've heard about a weapon they've made for sacrificing Spriggans.
It's Nilsine Shatter-Shield, in Windhelm. If Nilsine dies, too... I'll make it worth your while.
If you can... I want you to kill someone else, as well. You don't have to - not as part of our deal. But if you do... I'll pay you even more.
Just keep on Gulum-Ei's tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.
I'm glad to see you're embracing our methods. It would be a waste to lose a contact at the East Empire Company before we had the entire story.
Karliah didn't even want it, she wanted to keep the sale a secret. I can see how well that went.
Consider it a gift to ensure your silence. That thing seems to be bringing me nothing but trouble anyway.
My business is falling apart, my apprentice never listens to me and now there's talk of dragons.
If I hadn't sunk every bit of gold I had into my mill, I would have picked up and left Ivarstead long ago.
My family has owned Karthwasten for generations. Rare for anyone in the Reach that isn't a Nord.
Not that it does me any good. Nords think I'm working for the Forsworn. Forsworn think I'm working for the Nords.
My master and I had a bit of a falling out. We got into an argument and it got rather... heated.
He's kicked me out until I find someone who can settle our disagreement. That's where you come in.
No, I openly welcome the presence of armed strangers who have no reason to care about any of us.
Of course it bothers me! I'm sure it's only a matter of time until they seize our mill in the name of their war effort.
Next thing you know, there'll be more guards, and then we'll lose our homes as well. This is just the start of it, mark my words.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to figure out how we're going to fill our recently emptied mine.
And you've proven that was the best move I could have made. Don't give me that look. You're free to go.
Here, how about a little token for your efforts? My family's ring and all the things the guards confiscated from you when you were jailed.
Of course. My fellow Harbingers and I have been warming ourselves here. Trying to evade Hircine.
Ogmund the skald. He's old, respected, and I know for a fact that he worships Talos in his home.
But the Jarl has been hesitant to call for his arrest. I want you to break in to his home and find evidence.
Oh and you'll need the hip bone... it's very important. No entering Pelagius' Wing without that.
No, he went into the forbidden wing of the palace, to speak with an old friend. Said it had been ages since they had last had tea.
Last I saw him, he was visiting a friend in the Blue Palace. But no one as mundane as the Jarl. No, no... such people are below him.
Oh that's very sweet of you. Anything you can find out from Captain Aldis would be welcome news.
Oh, wipe that frown off your face Rogatus. You've been wearing that frown for over 50 years now.
You don't invite monsters into your home to have supper! I won't have them here, and I'm certainly not smiling for them!
Oh, stop being such a grouch! Not every visitor to the farm wants to burn it down! Maybe they just want to have a nice supper with us, hmm?
You want me to smile? What's there to smile about? Soldiers and dragons are going to be trampling all over the crops this year. I just know it.
On the other hand, the Thalmor have considerable funds and are looking to expand their shipping.
A delicate question, to be sure. I'm the Emperor's cousin, and the Empire has little love for the Thalmor.
I haven't signed any deals yet, but I'm sure my cousin will want a cut if I do. What better way to soothe his wounded pride?
Or else what? You think you can stand against the entire Whiterun city guard? The gate's closed.
Our own security forces are limited, and all the mercenaries are tied up in this ridiculous war.
We don't even know their base of operations, and attacking single ships won't really solve the problem.
Pfft. I'm the oldest woman in Dawnstar. Was here when the Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger.
He's a fool, if you haven't met him already. Thinks Ulfric Stormcloak is invincible and spits dragon fire.
The people here look to Brina Merilis when they need things settled. Real firebrand going up. Wasn't surprised when she joined the Legion.
Seems Brina Merilis and the Legion came and now she's Jarl. That's a relief. I don't like the fighting, but Brina is the woman for the job.
Phinis is one of the best Conjurers in all of Skyrim, and can help with spells from that school.
Precisely. There are a few who still call Nocturnal [QUOTE]Lady Luck[QUOTE] and for good reason.
Shutting this place down would dishonor my family's heritage, but what other choice will I have?
That means he has the pick of the litter from some of the finest goods to grace Skyrim's shores.
He isn't exactly in the Guild, but he pays us a cut of all the stuff he lifts from the warehouse.
Gulum-Ei works in the East Empire Company Warehouse. He helps maintain all of the shipments of goods that goes in and out of Solitude.
The Dragonborn is an exception to all the rules - the Dragon Blood itself is a gift of the gods.
We therefore seek to guide you on the proper use of your gift, which transcends the restrictions which bind other mortals.
If we accept one gift, how can we deny the other? As Dragonborn, you have received the ability to Shout directly from Akatosh.
The Jarl's palace in Whiterun? Ah, yes... the old story about King Olaf's pet dragon. Ingenious!
Yes, yes. We must think. He must have some means of travelling to and from Sovngarde. But no tale tells where that might be.
There's a smart lad. Take the map. The loot's hidden there. It'll show itself when you get near.
There's a smart lass. Check the map. The loot's hidden there. It'll show itself when you get near.
This giant... It's not the only thing in Fallowstone Cave. Getting to it isn't going to be easy.
You're going to clear a path to the giant, so I can conserve my strength. I'll make sure you're paid for it.
So you meet me at Fallowstone Cave, and we'll get this over with. I can have my tribe back, and you can... You can leave us alone.
This is a private home, and the master of the house is a very old man. He's not to be disturbed.
This isn't a command. Just decency. Help out an old blacksmith. I've got to get back to my work.
What are you doing here? The excavation site is closed. I don't need any more workers or guards.
Wise decision. The vaults in the Hall of the Vigilant will guard this against future temptation.
You must also pledge unswerving loyalty to your fellow Stormcloaks, to Skyrim and to her people.
Before you're one of us, you must swear fealty to Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, future High King of Skyrim.
You're gouging me for what little coin I make and you can't even protect yourselves? Ridiculous!
But I have many more rooms to clean. Fort Greymoor is quite large, and rather filthy if I do say.
By doing this, he's compromised our ties to Nocturnal and in essence, caused our luck to run dry.
Mercer was able to unlock the Guild's vault without two keys because of what he stole from the Twilight Sepulcher... the Skeleton Key.
Consider this an extremely risky job but with a massive potential for profit, and you'll do fine.
This isn't about religion or destiny. This is nothing more than a business transaction between yourself and Nocturnal.
Eehh.. Calixto and his books are often confused about such matters. It happens to the best of us.
Farewell, mortal. Know that Azura will be guarding over the threads of your fate in the Twilight.
Find Arniel Gane. He's somewhere in the northern section of the ruins. He'll show you what to do.
I expect he'd appreciate some help in locating any additional magical artifacts here in the ruins.
Any enchanted items will do; the usefulness of the enchantment is irrelevant. If you find anything, the class can look it over.
Ah, yes. Hmm. Well, why don't you see if you can assist Arniel Gane? He's one of our scholars, here working on cataloging our finds.
Ha ha! That's funny. Ya' think you can take me on? Try it anytime. I've been itching for a fight.
Having Goldenglow kept in line by the Thieves Guild has kept the honey flowing with minimal cost.
Now, mysteriously, some sort of anonymous adversary shows up and takes the Estate out of my hands.
He's been digging around the records the Blades left here, too. But we can talk about that later.
Esbern should be able to help. He's spent his whole life poring over every old book he could find about dragons and that prophecy.
He's gone in to defile our family tomb by using our ancestors for his filthy dark elf necromancy.
Vals Veran. My family has never really seen eye to eye with him and he has finally gone off the deep end.
His cause may be true, but the man is a lie... all he holds in his heart his lust for the throne.
He's begun a rebellion against those that wish to eradicate the worship of Talos and uses it as his rallying cry.
Ulfric only cares about one thing... Ulfric. He's ordained himself the future High King of Skyrim and steps on anyone that gets in his way.
Hopefully they made it to safety before the attack.  I'll begin the search after a quick restock.
How wonderful. Like the sea, their love roils and swells, but brings life and nourishment to all.
I don't know about such things, but I heard the Greybeards summon you. That's good enough for me.
I haven't heard from her lately. I've tried talking to Captain Aldis but he hasn't been any help.
My daughter, Fura, was assigned to Whiterun after she joined the Imperial Army.  I was hoping you might have met her.
I see. That power certainly exists, I assure you. Wield it faithfully, and few can withstand you.
I used some contacts in the Legion, asked some questions. Was told I should mind my own business.
I was hoping you'd offer. I didn't think it was my place to ask such a favor of you. I thank you.
If the Companions would hunt in the name of their lord, Hircine, we would be granted great power.
One of my predecessors was a good, but short-sighted man. He made a bargain with the witches of Glenmoril Coven.
The Companions are nearly five thousand years old. This matter of beastblood has only troubled us for a few hundred.
Just remember, if she tells you to do somethin'... you damn well better do exactly what she says.
She's also got ties to the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild, so basically no one can touch her.
Well, you got Maven, she pretty much runs the whole operation. She's got friends in high places if you know what I mean.
Last week a scholar came to us. He said he knew where we could find another fragment of Wuuthrad.
He seemed a fool to me, but if he's right, the honor of the Companions demands that we seek it out.
My king. Madanach. When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines.
My sister passed away some years ago, so I settled down here and opened the House of Curiosities.
I think she would be happy to know that our collection has brought smiles to faces both young and old.
My sister and I inherited a modest sum of money. We decided to travel and seek out whatever adventures we could find.
As we journeyed across Tamriel, we encountered tales of exotic and wondrous artifacts. We decided to collect as many as we could.
Not long, in truth. I came to Skyrim after I found myself unwelcome in both Elsweyr and Cyrodiil.
I seem to have an unfortunate talent for getting myself involved in misunderstandings with the law.
Ri'saad was able to look past that, and it was he who helped to set me up with a trade caravan. Now I work for him.
Now that's what I like to hear. Good work. I think you deserve some gold from my tips at the inn.
Now, we'll take our friend here back to Hammerfell, where she will pay the price for her treason.
Pick up your mess, then apologize, and if we think you're sincere we'll consider lending you aid.
Dibella teaches love and compassion, but that doesn't mean we're just going to tell you what you want to know and let you walk away from this.
Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to get even more interesting.
Our Family, my dearest. Our Family. Together, united as one, the Dark Brotherhood can accomplish anything.
Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in all your... endeavors.
But you must be anxious to get to work. I'm arranging a job, but need a bit more time. For now, go see Nazir. He's got several smaller contracts.
The Goldenglow Estate job has undoubtedly interrupted the supply of honey I need to make my mead.
Sabjorn could use this interruption to his advantage and collect a larger share of the market. I can't have that.
This is the most sacred mountain in Skyrim. Zok revak strunmah. The great mountain of the world.
Here the ancient Tongues, the first mortal masters of the Voice, brought Alduin to battle and defeated him.
Trouble? He's one of the most stubborn lizards I've ever met! You have your work cut out for you.
Underneath the College. It's not the nicest place, so if you go down there, please do be careful.
Well I'll be damned. We heard you were dead. Motierre's in the back room, if you've got business.
Well. Must preserve some professional secrets, mustn't we? I have my sources... reliable sources.
When you showed up here, I knew you were the one the Greybeards sent, and not some Thalmor plant.
I knew the Greybeards would send you there if they thought you were Dragonborn. They're nothing if not predictable.
Wonderful. You've just made an important contribution to the advancement of a Dwemer scholarship.
You and I have a date with destiny, it would seem. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm?
You hard of hearing? I run this smelter. And I'm late meeting our silver quota. What do you want?
A few days ago, we were ambushed. A nuisance, really, but many of the marauders had quick fingers.
One of them stole my Moon Amulet, given to me by my mother when I was just a cub. It is my only memory of home in this cold land.
Aduri is what some would call a free spirit. She likes to wander the fall forest for hours on end.
But around here, there's a tremendous amount of work to get done, not to mention the dangers she's not ready to face.
If we were still living at my alchemy shop in Vivec City, it wouldn't be so bad, she could wander the canals all day.
All right, if you insist. But we'll come running if it sounds like things have gotten out of hand.
And once you've had your fill of mead, do us all a favor and go home. Markarth has enough trouble.
That's about the only harmless thing you can do in this city. Silver-Blood Inn is the place to go.
Another Overseer will replace Orchendor, when the time comes. For now all is cleansed and ordered.
Did you leave any alive? The Afflicted are mere vessels for my Blessing. It will spread to others through their touch and my own.
Are you finished ogling the grotesque? I suppose I should be grateful you didn't simply attack me.
But my agents report that Galmar is pretty damned convinced Korvanjund is the tomb of King Borgas.
Well, to be frank, we don't. Its location was lost with King Borgas, when the Great Hunt killed him while off on his Alessian campaigns.
Supposedly, his body was brought back to Skyrim and secretly buried with the crown. Knowledge of that location was lost, in the Wars of Succession.
I know Galmar. We fought in many wars together. He's not a sentimental man taken to fancy. If he believes the crown is there... he's likely found it.
But you have indulged my weakness for speech long enough. Krosis. Now I will answer your question.
Can't fault anyone for that! As long as you hate the Empire as much as I do, that I can work with.
Do you think me a fool? Do you think I'm too stupid to make the connection? You've ruined my work!
You show up here just as our work nears completion, and now I can't get any results from this because of something at your College.
Fool. I should thank you. I knew the girl wouldn't be strong enough to help me kill Gathrik alone.
I already have the gold band, but all I need are three flawless amethysts to complete the setting.
In Black Marsh, tradition dictates we present a potential mate a unique wedding ring to represent our future bond.
I met her when I wandered into Riften a few years ago. Been smitten with her ever since. In fact, I'm thinking of asking her to marry me.
I am so very sorry. I went over this again and again, and I was sure it would have better results.
I killed a lot of High Elves in the Great War, and I didn't die. I guess that makes me a war hero.
Did we really save the Empire? Or did we just plant the seeds for Ulfric's uprising, and another war?
The [QUOTE]Great War[QUOTE]... there was nothing great about it. Thousands died on both sides, and where did it get us?
I know there's a cult that worships him at Haemar's Shame. We should be able to talk to him there.
If this works out, I'll make sure you're rewarded. Just don't trust any offer he makes you... okay?
Thank you. Now, since he banished me, Vile's been rather weak. He can't manifest very far from one of his shrines.
I was working with Vex and we got inside with no trouble. We found the loot, and made our way out.
It was on a job a few years back... it was supposed to be a simple burglary on a house in Windhelm.
I'm not stealing anything. Besides, some jail time isn't going to make me roll over and play dead.
I'm not sure how many men they have inside, but I trust that won't be an issue for you. Good luck.
Yes, indeed. The only thing I can tell you is that the mold was taken to the bandit's hideout... a small cottage called Pinewatch.
It is. These aren't particularly glamorous assassinations, I'll be honest. Don't pay much, either.
But they'll keep you busy. Just do them as you're able. There's no real time limit - the targets aren't going anywhere.
You can turn each one in as it's completed, or wait and turn in the whole group when all the targets have been eliminated. Whichever works for you.
It's immoral to worship a man. And it's also illegal. A faithful Imperial citizen would know that.
Look, you want it, I got it. You know the price, so talk to me when you want to cough up the gold.
I'm sorry you feel my illegal contraband is overpriced, perhaps you should bring it up at the next merchant guild meeting.
Mmm, sorry. I really can't risk it. I'm sure you can find someone else with a little less dignity.
No, I'm sorry. You must have me mistaken for someone else. I've never even heard that name before.
No? Well, then she hasn't gotten to you yet. But she will. And you don't you believe a word of it.
Now if there are no more questions, how about following me and I'll show you what we're all about.
Now it's up to me to save him one more time... this time from the executioner's block in Solitude.
A close friend of mine. We fought together on the battlefield for many years until old age got the better of us.
Oh, and if you meet Maven Black-Briar, stay on her good side. This is her city, and nobody else's.
You can get a room at the Bee and Barb, but mind your coin purse -- it's no secret the Thieves' Guild makes its home here.
One of their ceremonies involved the Pilgrim's Path, a so called [QUOTE]test of worthiness.[QUOTE]
These priests weren't threat to the Skeleton Key or the conduit to Nocturnal's realm, so they were tolerated.
If a pilgrim was able to complete the path, it was said that they would become one with the shadows. What that means is anyone's guess.
Quite amazing, yes. Alchemy and the blessings of a Divine distilled down into a ingestible liquid.
She's already come down hard on us for missing shipments. Likely to do it again, since we're late.
I'm just protecting Bryling's investment. She's the owner, even though we're the ones here doing all the work.
So you're telling me you and Sam just sent me in there to die, then? I want my money, you bastard.
If there's one thing I hate more than a mean-spirited drunk, it's one who can't settle their debts.
So, if you've got the nerve, I've got plenty of extra jobs to help get the Guild back on its feet.
See, that kind of attitude comes from someone who wants to get rich and stay alive long enough to enjoy it. We're goin' to get along nicely.
Some of us refused to bow. We knew the old ways would lead us back to having a kingdom of our own.
This was our land. We were here first. Then the Nords came and put chains on us. Forbid us from worshipping our gods.
That is who we are. The Forsworn. Criminals in our own lands. And we will cut a bloody hole into the Reach until we are free.
Sometimes they even look up. What do they see then? What if they dive in? Then the madness begins.
But the Elder Scrolls... they look left and right in the stream of time. The future and past are as one.
You look to your left, you see one way. You look to your right, you see another. But neither is any harder than the opposite.
Thank you. Your Shield-Siblings have withdrawn to the Underforge. I think they're waiting for you.
The choice was clear. And now, Ulfric threatens the thinly veiled peace we sacrificed so much for.
The White-Gold Concordat. Our treaty with the Elves after the Great War forbids free worship of Talos.
So when they did find out, it was either we arrest Ulfric and the militia, or enter into yet another war with the Aldmeri Dominion.
But that's what we promised Ulfric and his men. It seems foolish looking back, but at the time we were hoping the Elves wouldn't find out.
The Flagon was once a city beneath a city. We had our own smith, our own alchemist... you name it.
Best of all, we'd have enough gold to throw around so we can start living in the lap of luxury again.
If we can make a name for ourselves in Skyrim once again, I can almost promise you those merchants would return.
This Elder Scroll might be able to show you the past in some way, then... yes, yes, it could work.
Fascinating! So the ancients were more daring... or foolhardy... similar to the Dragon Break itself, although less far-reaching...
This has been going on for years. And all I've been able to find is murder and blood. I need help.
Please. You find out why that woman was attacked, who's behind Weylin and the Forsworn, and I'll pay you for any information you bring me.
Vomindok. I do not know. Perhaps in the very doing they erased the knowing of it from Time itself.
I warned them against such a rash action. Even I could not foresee its consequences. Nust ni hon. They would not listen.
The dov are children of Akatosh. Thus we are specially... attuned to the flow of Time. Perhaps also uniquely vulnerable.
Well then, look. Look all you want. And when you're done looking, maybe we can get some work done.
Why, because I'm a proud citizen of the Empire? Because the Stormcloaks only want Nords in Skyrim?
The Stormcloaks can rot in Oblivion for all I care. I've lived in this city for twenty years. Twenty!
Yes. You're right. If they needed to die so that Dawnstar could live, then it was worth the price.
You don't have to say anything. There's no need. You're here, so I know you'll accept my contract.
You're here! And not a moment too soon. If anything should happen to Arn, there'll be hell to pay.
A couple of years? I wasn't a Forsworn when I came, but I joined up when I got in. Easier that way.
A great many things obscured to you are quite clear to us. We have long believed you would prevail.
Ah Potema. Former queen of Solitude and one of the most dangerous necromancers in recorded history.
She was responsible for the Empire's near collapse almost five hundred years ago. I believe I have a book about her...
Ah, an excellent question. Mehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Lord of Change, Destruction, and Ambition.
Dagon's Mythic Dawn cult killed the Septim Dynasty and opened the Oblivion Gates into Tamriel. They called it the Oblivion Crisis.
Do you think you're strong enough for Kyne's blessing? I would be glad to pass this tradition down.
Finally, the Nords took over around Tiber Septim's time. That bent a few folks' arms the wrong way.
It's an old city. Legends say Dwarves built it first. Then after they vanished, the natives moved in.
He's an accomplished wizard. And, locating him may be challenging, as he travels with the caravans.
Here you go. Tell Hafjorg that she can chip off whatever she thinks is a fair trade for their time.
It's about time; I sent them a letter weeks ago. That Elgrim... he'd forget his own pants if his wife didn't help him dress.
Hmph. Look at you. So calm. So confident. I do believe you were born for this task. So let's begin.
I am the spirit of the hunt, just one glimpse of the glorious stalker that your kind calls Hircine.
I should say so. I'd be careful in the future before you confront someone without all of the facts!
I try to do my little part. Besides, just between you and me, it's making me pots of money, hahaha.
You must be new to Skyrim, or you'd already know who I am. I have a stake in most anything of importance in Solitude.
I feel that it's time to put aside the grievances of the past, and let peace and prosperity flourish between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion.
It... It's very valuable. Critical to my work, and one-of-a-kind. That's all I care to say for now.
No but my husband Torygg would want a proper burial and this is the way Nords are buried in Skyrim.
No objections, then? Good. Go now. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.
Now, while I'm certain this is all terribly interesting to you, I have important matters to attend.
I'm originally from Cyrodiil, sent here at the request of the Emperor himself. I'm often ordered to places with problems that need fixing.
Oh really? Well you can tell them that I will be putting in a request for a few dresses quite soon.
Oh, no need to be shy! My day is your day! Please - eat, drink, make merry! We're all friends here!
Oh, no. But being surrounded by good music, good drink and good friends is all I've ever asked for.
Petty thieving, huh? Just like poor Grisvar. Hopefully you'll learn your lesson faster than he has.
Please. You're in the presence of a born huntsman. I can hear the sweat sliding down your forehead.
See if you can find some, and I'll try to find some more interesting work by the time you get back.
So I've let him run his little Forsworn rebellion from inside Cidhna Mine. Now he's out of control.
When their uprising was crushed, I had Madanach brought to me. He was a wild animal, but a useful one.
I offered him a stay from execution if he used his influence to deal with any annoyances that came up. Competitors, agents, idiots.
That may be true, but I ordered Irileth to bring back proof. You'd best report back to her at once.
That sounds good. I'm not sure the court will believe that Olaf had wizard powers but we shall see.
That's the trouble. I know Faleen from the Keep, but I have no idea what sorts of things she likes.
It's not a simple matter. I could offend her fairly easily by bringing up the wrong subject. I've seen it happen before.
This one time only, I'll grant you special immunity for any past transgressions, real or perceived.
But going forward, I'm sure you realize that your fate is in your own hands. And the law can not be bent for personal friendships.
Hmm... Yes, I've heard about all that fuss. I myself know it's all a terrible, terrible misunderstanding. I'm quite sure you're innocent in all this.
Three in fact. They're my own recipe. Brought them over here from my days as a bartender in Gideon.
Second, we have the [QUOTE]White-Gold Tower[QUOTE] which is heavy cream with a layer of blended mead, lavender and dragon's tongue on top.
Last, and only for the bravest of souls, we have the [QUOTE]Cliff Racer[QUOTE] which is Firebrand Wine, Cyrodiilic Brandy, Flin and Sujamma.
First is the [QUOTE]Velvet Lechance[QUOTE] which is a mixture of blackberry, honey, spiced wine and a touch of nightshade... perfectly safe, I assure you.
Well, we have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation, so don't get sentimental on me now.
When I heard Cicero screaming, I knew you'd been discovered. I feared the worst. Are you all right?
You can tell Jarl Igmund that the Silver-Blood family won't tolerate his cowardice for much longer.
You sure about that? You want to let that dragon loose after all the trouble to catch him in there?
You've never had a taste of sweet Honningbrew? Why, it's only the finest mead outside of Sovngarde!
But I forget myself. Krosis. So los mid fahdon. Melancholy is an easy trap for a dovah to fall into.
Savor your triumph, Dovahkiin. This is not the last of what you will write upon the currents of Time.
You have won a mighty victory. Sahrot krongrah - one that will echo through all the ages of this world for those who have eyes to see.
Comes down to trust, I expect. After Dengeir gave up his seat to his nephew, he didn't trust anyone.
Everywhere he looks, he sees assassins, spies an' plots against him. I'm the only one he confides in.
So, when he was made Jarl again, he didn't wait a moment to name me his Steward. He said I was the only choice.
Dragging people off in the middle of the night... one of the main causes of this war, if you ask me.
We didn't pay much attention to it when I was a boy - everyone still had their little shrine to Talos.
Even I'll admit it hasn't been the Empire's finest hour. But it wasn't like the Emperor had any choice, did he?
If he hadn't signed the peace treaty with the Thalmor, they would have destroyed the Empire - then where would Skyrim be?
It's from that treaty that ended the Great War, remember, when the Emperor was forced by the Thalmor to outlaw Talos worship.
But then Ulfric and his [QUOTE]Sons of Skyrim[QUOTE] started agitating about it, and sure enough the Emperor had to crack down.
I guess that wasn't such a big deal elsewhere in the Empire, but here it's caused a lot of resentment. Native son and all that.
That's the part that Ulfric's supporters always conveniently forget about. Unless the Empire stands together, the Thalmor will destroy us all.
Excellent. Looks like you've really driven them into hiding. Keep this up. We'll wipe them out, yet.
Go now. I have seen the threads of your fate in the Twilight, and you still have much to accomplish.
Oblivion has been watching you since the day you were conceived, mortal. Do not think that your life has been served by your will alone.
He's a hapless beggar living in some ruins just outside the village of Ivarstead. Easy even for you.
How did... no, forget it. I don't care to know. I'm free of the little man, and that's what matters.
I don't deal in land or property. Now, if you're looking for goods, you've come to the right person.
I give you my ring. Wear it, and when you feast on the flesh of the dead, I will grant you my power.
Mortal. I am Namira, the Lady of Decay. Your consumption of the blood and bile of Arkay's own is pleasing to me.
I just hate to see what's happened to him. He hasn't always been like this, you know. Drunk, I mean.
Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with him being here all the time. He mostly keeps to himself, and so far he's been able to pay.
I never asked you to help in the first place. Why would I? Everyone in Skyrim only helps themselves.
I wish I could help you, but I've been a prisoner in this very chamber for the last quarter century.
The only possible help I've come across are the remains of some poor fellow who was trying to follow in your footsteps. Perhaps his journal can help?
I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there are several Khajiit Caravans that travel across the realm.
They're shrewd traders and don't mind getting their hands dirty. I've bartered with their leader, Ri'saad, on more than one occasion.
If you really are Dragonborn, then Skyrim needs you. Go to High Hrothgar and talk to the Greybeards.
It's an entirely different situation. I don't expect you to comprehend the nuances of these matters.
Regardless, I'm making you a very simple offer. You get me the staff, and I give you Onmund's precious amulet. Do we have a deal?
It's full of spiders, that's what's wrong with it! Almost killed Grogmar and me when they showed up.
I'm worried that they'll come out of the mine looking for food soon... then we're in even bigger trouble.
Just head right back to the Guild and get the information to Mercer. Nothing else is more important.
If you discover Gulum-Ei's holding out on us and has more loot stashed away than he claims, we'd find that information quite valuable as well.
Just what we need. City folk barging in, probably looking for an offering to their precious Divines.
Well, look at this. Another city rat crawled outside the walls. I don't suppose you've come up here to tell old Froki about your supposed Divines?
Just... Just bring me some Dwemer cogs. I need to examine them for the methods used in forging them.
Ten of them should be enough for me to get a better understanding of how they were crafted. That's all I need, all right?
Nivenor is my wife. How I was ever able to meet such a gorgeous creature is one of life's mysteries.
We're... at odds about my charity. She thinks the people in this town have become lazy and expecting a handout.
I try to include her in my lessons from Maramal over at the Temple of Mara, but she prefers to shop instead. Different strokes, eh?
None of that matters to me. Until someone takes a Dunmer, I let Windhelm deal with its own problems.
Now, I have a soul in Oblivion that needs claiming. Take care of the house while I'm gone. Ha ha ha!
Of course, it would be much easier to check with an alchemist. They occasionally have them for sale.
A flame atronach's body might provide fire salt. They're dangerous creatures that can be summoned by wizards.
One of the guards dropped this key while I hid. I wager it will come in handy for you. Please hurry!
Only inside the gates. Much of Falkreath hold is wilderness and there's plenty of trouble to be had.
Rusted. Dry. There was a time when this mace dripped with the blood of the feeble and the worthless.
But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate it. Left it here to decay. Until you came.
So I grew up with a miserable trade. This is all I know how to do... prepare and inter the deceased.
I never had any friends; who'd want to spend time with [QUOTE]the little weird girl who hangs around dead people?[QUOTE]
My father was a Priest of Arkay. All my life was spent around the dead, being forced to learn the proper burial rituals and prayers.
Stay close and in plain view. No funny business unless you want a few inches of steel in your belly.
The Dwemer found a loophole, as they always do. To focus the knowledge away and inside without harm.
To glimpse the world inside an Elder Scroll can damage the eyes. Or the mind, as it has to Septimus.
Place the lexicon into their contraption and focus the knowings into it. When it brims with glow, bring it back and Septimus can read once more.
The energy coming from it has prevented us from reaching you with the visions you have already seen.
I've given us a chance to speak privately, but I'm afraid I can't do this for long. We must be brief.
The situation here at your College is of dire importance, and attempts to contact you as we have previously have failed.
I believe it is due to the very source of our concern. This object... The Eye of Magnus as your people have taken to calling it.
The longer it remains here, the more dangerous the situation becomes. And so I have come here personally to tell you it must be dealt with.
The Thalmor happened. They've been hunting down every Blade they can find for the past thirty years.
Thanks to the White-Gold Concordat, they've been able to operate throughout the Empire with impunity.
Then you've seen them, too. We lost our home, our livestock... We barely have enough gold to get by.
There were just too many obstacles blocking the way. The plans were shelved and the rest is history.
Not just ordinary gems. They're said to be flawlessly cut and as big as a man's head. Can you imagine how much they're worth?
Gallus and Mercer spent the better part of a month infiltrating Irkngthand, but the dwarves had protected the place far too well.
They were a secret cabal of the three top rogues in the Thieves Guild. No one knew their identities.
It wasn't until recently that I heard Mercer Frey and this Dark Elf named Karliah were a part of that group.
Some people say they watched over the group, others say they were reserved for the most elite jobs. I don't really know.
We were doing well, plenty of coin, a huge mansion and I was even betrothed to a lovely young woman.
I used to live in Valenwood working at my father's winery... we made the finest wine to ever cross your lips I promise you.
We were supposed to find a sacrifice. Human sacrifice. I told her I couldn't do it and she attacked.
I've done horrible things living here, but never taken an innocent life. I couldn't just find some person for them to kill.
Well all right. Here, I scribbled down the last place I'd heard about. Check it out, but be careful.
Who are you? You... you're with the Dark Brotherhood, ain'tcha? I knew it. I knew you'd come for me!
Year seven, I think? Surprised I haven't cut my own throat out by now, but something keeps me going.
You can stick a sword through an Imperial any day you want. But that doesn't make you a Stormcloak.
We're not just fighting Imperials. We're fighting to restore Skyrim to her glory and give her the king she deserves.
You need something talk to my husband. Vantus Loreius. Or just Loreius, if it's all the same to you.
You were given this gift by the gods for a reason. It is up to you to figure out how best to use it.
Your blood should be good enough. This will go easier for us both if you don't bother fighting back.
There's just one more thing I need from you. To fully absorb Gathrik's power I require a blood sacrifice.
Actually, there is, but I don't think I could get away with doing it. She'd kill me if she found out.
If you confront her with three of the Marks, she'd be so embarrassed... well, I don't know what she'd do!
You see, I happen to know after she makes love, she gives her partner a token of her affection called a Mark of Dibella.
After we discovered what she'd done, we spent months trying to track her down, but she just vanished.
Karliah destroyed everything this Guild stood for. She murdered my predecessor in cold blood and betrayed the Guild.
And you have companionship. A child of night, and a stalker of the sands. Together, you are a family.
It is the last resting place of an assassin of old. A Dark Brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you.
Your destiny is dark. Oh yes, so dark. But much of it has been fulfilled. You have found sanctuary, and the comforting words of a mother's love.
There's a cave. No, not a cave. A... home? A place you feel secure. You will find safety there... sanctuary. I see snow, lit by the star of dawn.
And you are not alone. There are others. A child of night... a stalker of the sands? Oh, but before you are family, there will be blood. Such blood.
Wait! There's something else... A potential for adventure, and wealth. It is a ruin, ripe for the plunder. Deepwood Redoubt. Far to the northwest...
Through there is... Hag's End. The last resting place of an assassin of old. A Dark Brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you.
Don't mention the Guild. In fact, it's better if you don't speak to me at all. This is not the place.
Drem. Patience. There are formalities which must be observed, at the first meeting of two of the dov.
For twenty-five years I ran, never sleeping in the same place twice and carefully covering my tracks.
Mercer lied to the Guild, branded me a murderer and slandered my name across his network of contacts.
Mercer doesn't need to die... he needs to feel the cold sting of fate as his life crumbles in front of him and he's hunted by the Guild.
I believe the Legate gave you an order. Why are you standing around here flapping your jaw? Move out!
I could soul trap you. Place you inside the Star. Then bring you back once Malyn has been dealt with.
I don't care what you promise. If I tell you the buyer's name and word gets around, it could ruin me!
All right. Had I known the deal would bring me this much trouble, I never would have accepted the gold.
I suppose that makes sense. You didn't mention a Sam and nothing you said about the staff made sense.
You didn't seem to need either to sell Gleda to the Giant in the first place. I think you'll figure it out.
You left a note but it was mostly gibberish, the only bit I could make out was [QUOTE]after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.[QUOTE]
I'd always intended Mercer's fate to ultimately be decided by the Guild, and it seems they've spoken.
From the moment you were struck with my poisoned arrow at Snow Veil Sanctum, my path changed its course.
Perhaps I couldn't bring Mercer back alive, but together, we were able to clear my name and to put Gallus's memory to rest.
I've found the final resting place of the Jagged Crown. Can you believe it? Well, I'm almost certain.
Your fellow Stormcloaks are already assembling outside the tomb. I'll meet you there as soon as I'm finished up here.
We're headed to Korvanjund. But, if old King Borgas is indeed buried there, we're bound to run into trouble of some kind.
It's a small town, with one rather unique feature - it houses Skyrim's only Penitus Oculatus outpost.
It was established by Commander Maro when he first arrived in Skyrim, several months ago. When he began preparing for the Emperor's initial visit.
It's believed that they are literally what guides our uncanny luck... by placing their hands in ours.
That's why the Ebonmere needed to be reopened. Without it, there's no way Nocturnal was able to allow them through.
Absolutely. When we say [QUOTE]walk with the shadows,[QUOTE] we are asking those Nightingales who have passed on to protect us.
Like I told you, last time I saw her she was headed for Hobs Fall Cave. No idea what happened to her.
My travels have taken me from High Rock to Valenwood, Elsweyr to Morrowind and all points in between.
I've been adventuring across Tamriel since I was a fresh-faced young woman barely able to swing a blade.
No one in the Jarl's court is above the charge of conspiring against the city. You're coming with us.
No. I don't have any idea. I was just shopping for a pendant for my sister back in the Imperial City.
Nobody knows his true identity. Well, nobody except Gaius Maro, and you've already taken care of him.
In any event, our anonymous chef shares a passion for food with all of Tamriel. And that anonymity will prove the Emperor's undoing.
I do know the Gourmet was classically trained in traditional Breton cuisine in High Rock. So that's where he must have met Anton Virane.
Nothing raises my ire more than having an agreement broken. It's bad for business and it wastes time.
Captain Volf of the Dainty Sload has decided to test my patience on this matter by neglecting to honor a trade agreement we had established.
Of course, they'd never come into direct contact with Nocturnal but they insisted they had her favor.
As part of their [QUOTE]duties,[QUOTE] the priests created all sorts of baseless rituals and ceremonies all on Nocturnal's behalf.
Even though Nocturnal doesn't desire worship in the traditional sense, the Twilight Sepulcher propagated a small group of priests.
Petra! Evil Petra put me here, stole my tower. Hate her, chew her bones! Let me out, kind, kind meat.
Ponder the meaning of spirit. Unslaad zii. Where mortal flesh may wither and die, the spirit endures.
That is [QUOTE]Feim.[QUOTE] Let that meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You will find that your spirit will give you more strength.
[QUOTE]Fade[QUOTE] in your tongue. Mortals have greater affinity for this Word than the dov. Everything mortal fades away in time, but the spirit remains.
She was... he ripped her apart. Like a sabre cat tears a deer. We barely found enough of her to bury.
Sleep? I can't sleep now! There's too much to be done. And what's this Void you're rambling on about?
Thank you so much. I swear it's a fight with them every shipment. Here's something for your troubles.
That's right. Welcome to Markarth, traveler. Thank the Divines you can choose to live somewhere else.
That's the only time when we get food, too. And if there's not enough ore mined up, we don't get any.
They come in here once a week to clean out the bodies, grab any ore we've mined, and beat down the troublemakers.
The answer is simple. Orcs. There is a stronghold nearby whose hunters can butcher a deer in seconds.
Ah, now that is a good question. Where does Hogni get the finest, freshest meat from all over the Reach?
Let me show you where they are. Maybe they welcome you. Maybe they put an arrow in your face. Who knows?
Now having an Orc for a wife would be something, yes. Strong and bulky. Too bad they don't let people go beyond the walls.
The Forsworn? Strange. Well, I hope the Eight give you more peace in the future, for what it's worth.
Then... there is hope after all. For so long, all I could do was watch our doom approach, helplessly.
They say that something happened in the Hall of the Dead. Brother Verulus has the whole place closed.
Did you hear? The Hall of the Dead is closed. Brother Verulus isn't the most popular man in town right now.
We've been contracted to make sure Brand-Shei remembers not to meddle in affairs that aren't his own.
Now, since we're not the Dark Brotherhood, we're not going to kill him, we're just going to make sure he sits in the prisons for a few days.
Would you be interested in gathering some materials for me? I'd certainly be happy to compensate you.
I do. Sadly, I'm one of the few traditional Saxhleel Jewelers that remains in Tamriel; it's becoming a lost art.
Only trouble is gathering materials has become hazardous. The roads to the mines and to the other cities are thick with bandits... and worse.
You can pretend not to hear me all you want... but you better stay out of the Black-Briars' business.
You have quite the bounty on your head in The Pale. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared.
You have quite the bounty on your head in The Rift. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared.
You have quite the bounty on your head in Whiterun. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared.
You'd better get to Riften. Talk to Brynjolf. He's... well-connected. A good starting point at least.
You'd better get to Riften. Ask around the Ragged Flagon, in the Ratway. It's at least a good starting point.
Ah, let's see, what else... The Bards College is here, and the main office of the East Empire Company.
If you need it, you can get a room for a fair price at the Winking Skeever, just inside the main gate.
Solitude's been the capital of Skyrim as long as I can remember. Most of the High Kings of Skyrim were Jarls of Solitude first.
All right, you convinced me. Doubt I'd be much good to you, anyway. The little fop cut me pretty deep.
But I slashed him good. Pretty sure I severed an artery. Don't know what you're going to find in there... but you can probably just follow the blood.
By Azura, it gets hot in there. I use Frost Salts for a potion to keep the heat bearable, but I'm out.
Nosy one, huh? I was a mage back in Morrowind. I lend my talents to the mines here, helping them keep the tunnels safe.
Come back in a few nights when the wedding reception is over and we'll start the ceremony when you do.
We would but there's a big wedding taking place at Castle Dour. We'll have to wait until after the wedding.
Cut out the middleman, eh? Shrewd, very shrewd. You sure you don't have some Black-Briar blood in you?
Did he, now? That doesn't sound like my nephew at all. I doubt he'd be mixed up with the likes of you.
Have you? All good, I trust. But you have me at a disadvantage. I'm afraid I know nothing about you...
I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time and I'll see what I can do.
If trying to rid yourself of stolen goods becomes a burden, and you find yourself in Winterhold, visit me at the College.
If you ever manage to gain entry to the College, and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen goods becoming a burden, come visit me.
If it's true that the dragons have returned, what will it mean for all of us? Is this how it all ends?
If Maven Black-Briar keeps raising prices on mead, I'll have to resort to watering it down just to make ends meet.
Sibbi Black-Briar is furious that his ex-lover tried to murder him. He's leaving no stone unturned searching for her.
Crime is at an all-time high in this city thanks to the Thieves Guild. Don't we have enough problems with the war going on?
The Thieves Guild has been pushing hard to regain a foothold in this city. Rumor has it they're falling apart from the inside.
Riften's biggest exports used to be fishing and honey, until the Black-Briar family moved in. Now the meadery is the biggest game in town.
Mjoll the Lioness used to adventure across Skyrim before she settled down in Riften. I hear it all ended when she lost her enchanted blade.
The city guard has been tearing Riften apart looking for the source of our skooma problem. I'd hate to be in their shoes if they get discovered.
If you wish to learn more about them, you're welcome to my tome on the subject. Should be on my table.
In the middle of it all, the College was practically untouched. Many of the survivors were suspicious.
Some believed the mages were behind the whole thing, and others felt they could have at least prevented it.
Arch-Mage Aren assures me that his people had nothing to do with it, and I believe him. But Winterhold never recovered.
Just about eighty years ago, there was a terrible disaster. The cliffs overlooking the Sea of Ghosts collapsed, taking most of Winterhold with them.
Jarl Elisif the Fair. Poor woman. Losing her husband and king like that. It was a dark day for us all.
Damn, that reminds me, I have a delivery to make to her steward, Falk Firebeard. He ordered a special bottle of Stros M'Kai Rum.
Just a prank? Just a prank? The Daedric Lord of Debauchery does not deal in mere [QUOTE]pranks.[QUOTE]
This may have begun as a minor amusement, but it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff.
Just be careful where you do it. Some cowards in this land can't stand the sight of glory before them.
You have the blood of the wolf in you. You'll need to build up your strength before you can call on it again, though.
Just like Talos himself at the Battle of Old Hroldan, reclaiming the Reach from those heathen natives.
He used the Thu'um. Shouted those Forsworn from the walls. Then he led a band of Nord warriors in to take the city.
Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul darkness has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy.
Masters of the Way of the Voice. They live in seclusion high on the slopes of the Throat of the World.
My pleasure. But I think it's time for you to go. No fun keeping you locked up in here with the staff.
Nepos the Nose? He's been in Markarth forever. And he's well-respected among the natives of the Reach.
Good work. Here's your gold. I have a feeling Nepos gets his own orders, though. If you find out, I'll have more for you.
Now - hear his name. Odahviing. Taste it on the wind. Od-ah-viing. Know it in your su'um. Od-ah-viing!
Oh, thank goodness! I've been wandering alone for so long, I thought I'd never see another soul again.
Once you get to the tower, head north. Bleak Falls Barrow should be just around the corner further up.
Well, it's a winding road up the mountain just ahead. You'll know you're in the right place once you spot the old watchtower.
Perfect. Hopefully this will let us know more about their movement. I think we've got them on the run!
She... she said that? She said those words... to you?  [QUOTE]Darkness rises when silence dies[QUOTE]?
Then... it is true! She is back! Our Lady is back! She has chosen a Listener! She has chosen you! Ha ha ha! All hail the Listener!
But those are the words. The Binding Words. Written in the Keeping Tomes. The signal so I would know. Mother's only way of talking to sweet Cicero...
The Jarl will definitely want to talk to you. You'll find him in Dragonsreach, at the top of the hill.
Riverwood's in danger, too? You'd better go on in. You'll find the Jarl in Dragonsreach, at the top of the hill.
The name's Maul; I watch the streets for the Black-Briars. If you need dirt on anything, I'm your guy.
We have felt the whisper of a Word. Give me your map, and I will show you where its echo can be found.
Well, I was right, wasn't I? Focused completely wrong by the time we got here! The cold had warped it!
Gavros had to cart it all the way back to Cyrodiil. Left the rest of us here to fend off the damnable Falmer.
It didn't work the first time. I tried to tell Gavros, but he wouldn't listen. [QUOTE]No, it won't be too cold[QUOTE] he said.
Word on the street says that the Thieves Guild is coming back into its own in Markarth so I figured...
Look, I talked to the Jarl, the Steward, the Housecarl... everyone. They all told me their resources were spread too thin right now.
You assassins and your riddles. It really does get very annoying, you know. Now if you'll excuse me...
You have quite the bounty on your head in Eastmarch. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared.
You have quite the bounty on your head in Falkreath. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared.
You have quite the bounty on your head in Haafingar. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared.
You have quite the bounty on your head in The Reach. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared.
You should think harder on your commitment to Skyrim's freedom next time you're deciding what's right.
I'm sure that will be a great comfort to the families of your comrades who died to free the land you just gave back to the Empire.
You think some Emperor sitting on a gilded throne in Cyrodiil is going to know what's best for Skyrim?
I'm no man's fool. I know Ulfric Stormcloak's selfish and power-hungry, but he's the devil I know. Does that put it plain enough for you?
The Imperial City's so far from here, it might as well be on one of the moons. And yet the Empire thinks it can tell us what to do an' how to live.
You, too, huh? I'd take a straight fight with the whole Legion over creeping around a place like this.
Ah, well. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.
Ah, you're back. I hope you've made some progress on tracking down this Shout we need to defeat Alduin?
And here you are. Good. Come in, browse the display, and let's talk. I have a job you look perfect for.
Been here ever since I left the Bards College. Turns out a few muscles earn more gold than a damn lute.
The Silver-Bloods pay me, let me crack a few skulls, and keep the guards off my back. That's all I need.
No. I live in a nice house in Solitude where the air isn't filled with smoke from the silver smelters and golden-haired girls shine my shield.
Both the Imperials and Stormcloaks have sent riders this way, scouting the bridge and the lands nearby.
They stayed at the inn, but didn't pay. They said soldiers don't need to pay because they're risking their lives to protect us.
And that's not all. They took a heap of our lumber, and one tried to have his way with my daughter. They think they can do whatever they want.
Don't worry, I'm mad at her, too. And at myself for ever agreeing to get involved in her insane scheme.
Drowning your troubles in mead? A lot of folks are doing that these days. You'll want the Windpeak Inn.
As for work, you could try to catch Skald in a good mood, but your best bet would be working in the mines. They're on opposite ends of town.
Either leave Valenwood, or he'd have me thrown into jail. Gave me a day to say my goodbyes to everyone.
Well, after a while my father caught on to what I was doing. He confronted me one night and gave me a choice.
Hjalti? I've never heard of anyone named Hjalti. Tiber Septim had many names. Maybe that's one of them?
I am under no obligation to tell you anything. Now, leave me at once and never mention that you saw me.
I don't know. When I asked her where she was going she just muttered [QUOTE]Where the end began.[QUOTE]
Here, take the Goldenglow Estate Deed as proof. And when you speak to Mercer, tell him I'm worth more to him alive.
I had Vald meet the caravan from Winterhold on the western end of the lake so he could avoid the roads.
The idiot got lost in the mist and ran his boat right over some rocks, sending it straight to the bottom.
He's too stupid to remember where he was, and any attempt I've made to find it in the past has been unsuccessful.
I think it only fitting that the Arch-Mage personally receive a large portion of the reward. Well done.
I'll make sure the Emperor himself hears of all you've accomplished. You've made Skyrim a better place.
I'm setting him up with a new identity. It's the only way to throw the guard permanently off his trail.
Hold a moment. This is more than a simple prison break. I want to have Arn's name stricken from the record books permanently.
If he were to be crowned High King, I'm not so certain it would be the golden age his followers expect.
Many have died taking up arms for this cause. I fear that the land will be stained with blood for years to come.
Between you and I, I think his motivations are a bit more self-serving. He uses this holy war as leverage in order to pursue the throne.
With the Stormcloaks at his back, Ulfric's poised to rid Skyrim of the Empire's forces and invalidate our involvement with the White-Gold Concordat.
If you were willing to retrieve him for me I'd give you some fresh meat to attract him out on the road.
If you would have asked me that yesterday, I'd have said no. But now I think our chances have improved.
Look, call me crazy if you like, but I trust Karliah. I don't think she'd lead us down a suicidal path.
Besides, I'd rather die with some of Mercer's blood on my blade than spend the rest of my life regretting that I ran the other way.
Indeed. Orin brit ro. I cannot leave here until you defeat Alduin, which you cannot do without my help.
It's appreciated. The captains around here will have one less thing to worry about. Here's your reward.
Look, I can't make the coin appear out of thin air. Please, be reasonable. I'll... I'll pay next month.
Lot krongrah. You truly have the Voice of a dovah. Alduin's allies will think twice after this victory.
Luckily they don't know who he really is, or he wouldn't be serving drinks at the Ambassador's parties.
Don't worry about Malborn. He's not a dangerous character like you, but he hates the Thalmor at least as much as I do.
He's a wood elf - the Thalmor wiped out his family back in Valenwood during one of their purges that we never hear about.
Now that it's upon us, I'm rather looking forward to the challenge. I'll be famouser than Olaf One-Eye!
Oh, very brisk. When the snow sets in, even the hardiest Nord needs some spiced wine to warm the blood.
They're... adequate. Honestly, I rely on the business brought in by the Burning of King Olaf, and that's not likely to happen this year.
Splendid! If you'll just follow me, I'll tell you tales and show you wonders such as you've never seen.
Suit yourself, but you better decide what you want to do about this arrest. No one walks away for free.
Tell Delvin that if he still desires to have my support for the Thieves Guild in Windhelm, he's got it.
It pains me to see this locket... to be reminded of  Fjotli once more, but I'm glad it's back where it belongs.
That's all right. I can teach you a very basic ward, one that's enough for the purposes of this lesson.
That's right, at least according to them scholars. Stonework's clearly not Nord, that much is for sure.
Old Elven fella named Calcelmo is up in Understone Keep's the one you want to talk to for more about that. Wrote all those books.
That's right. Whole group of the natives called the Forsworn rose up against the Nords. Drove them out.
Then Ulfric Stormcloak came with his militia. That must have been a sight to see, him shouting folks to death.
You'd think that'd be the end of it, but those Forsworn are still in the hills, and they're as wild as wolves.
The wizards called it the Quill of Gemination and demanded a tremendous amount of gold to have it made.
If you can locate the quill and return it to me, something Vald was too stupid to do himself, I'll consider the debt satisfied.
This is only a taste of the benefits that accrue to those that align themselves with Thalmor interests.
Of course not. One does not gather the most important men and women of Skyrim and then serve them cheap ale and stale bread.
Those Battle-Born... they're in with the Imperials. They know it too, and yet they lie to my very face!
All I can think about is my son, my Thorald... they say that he was killed, but I know better. I know my son is alive!
Until then, let me offer you a warning. Beware the Forsworn. No place in the Reach is safe from us now.
Now? I announce to all of Markarth that I have returned. Don't worry about your name. They'll know who to blame and fear after today.
It'll take years, but I'll organize the Forsworn again. We'll reclaim our land, and then, when power is ours, we'll have peace. A kingdom.
We can't afford to give Paarthurnax the opportunity to betray us in turn, and return to his old master.
Whether or not he has truly repented, or merely acted to save himself, justice demands that he pay with his life.
True, he turned traitor to Alduin and helped overthrow the Dragon Cult, but that does not excuse or expiate his previous deeds.
Paarthurnax was the author of many atrocities during the Dragon War - crimes great enough to be remembered for thousands of years.
Here's the big picture. He helped Alduin enslave our ancestors. He may have betrayed Alduin in the end, but that makes him worse, not better.
We're stretched thin in Solitude, and I don't expect these bandits to be much challenge. Are you ready?
What've you been staring at your feet this whole time? You see that big city up ahead of you? Markarth?
Head over there, unless you feel like helping my wife pick crops. And then 50 years later you'll wake up and still be here.
Why don't you come in? You can browse the displays, and we can talk. I have a job you look perfect for.
I have a collection of artifacts from the group that toppled an Empire. Their importance to history cannot be forgotten.
Never mind that. Madena is a good woman, but I have my own reasons for opening this museum, and I'm not changing my mind.
Why? There's nothing to discuss as long as that traitor Ulfric is in arms against his rightful Emperor.
Yes, actually. How about you smith me an iron dagger? Here's everything you need to make one. Go ahead.
You don't remember me, Hjalti? Two campaigns we served together. You saved my life time and time again.
You have quite the bounty on your head in Hjaalmarch. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared.
You have quite the bounty on your head in Winterhold. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared.
You mean... there's still a chance? But how? Our plan has gone to ruin, everyone is dead, the Family...
You might just make it. But for now, you're still a whelp to us, new blood. So you do what we tell you.
Here's my sword. Go take it up to Eorlund to have it sharpened. And be careful, it's probably worth more than you are.
You'll just have to wait until after the captain's finished. I suppose you can wait around if you must.
Your destiny requires you to use your Voice - why else would Akatosh have bestowed this power upon you?
If you remember to use your Voice in service to the purpose of Akatosh, you will remain true to the Way.
That is commendable. But remember, the Dragon Blood is itself a gift of Akatosh. Do not try to deny that gift.
A mage is only as good as what he knows. I try and make sure as much knowledge is available as possible.
We've been keeping this collection since the Second Era. Books have come and gone during that time, but it's mostly intact.
Be wary what you say around here, friend. You'll find not all take kindly to [QUOTE]insurrection.[QUOTE]
I dared speak of the Empire and the lies that have been spread by Ulfric, the leader of the Stormcloaks.
Because I did something not a soul in this bloodstained house of war has the backbone to do... dared to speak my mind.
Now my mother's stripped me of my heritage and incarcerated me here like a common criminal and my brother has all but disowned me.
But you probably wanted to know about the fancy carvings and stonework, didn't you? Travelers always do.
My family came here centuries ago. We've made a good living smithing the silver that flows through the city.
Here, I have a delivery I need to make to Calcelmo. Why don't you take it to him? He knows the history of Markarth better than anyone.
Excellent work, soldier. I have to admit, I had my doubts it even existed. Did you run into any trouble?
Excellent! Sorry it didn't work out with you and your lady. I know how excited you were for the wedding.
You kept saying it would be a huge ceremony at Morvunskar. You said you even had some magic staff there that would handle all the guests.
Excellent! These things do have a way of working out when people take action. I'll sanctify the remains.
Head to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun and look for Mallus Maccius. He'll fill you in on all the details.
I don't care who you're with. After what you did, you're lucky I'm not cutting you down where you stand!
I don't know much about Morvunskar but it sounded like a lovely place for the ceremony. Congratulations.
I think I would prefer my ring back. I put a lot of time into making it and you just gave is away as a joke.
Decided to go through with it then? I knew you couldn't have forgotten about your fiance. You spoke of her so glowingly.
I don't know, but this place is full of them. Every one I've encountered has been enchanted or the like.
I know the High King invited them here, but he didn't ask me or anyone else first. Maybe he should have.
They're parasites. They're living in our city, under our protection, but what do they do for us? Nothing!
I need you to take a case of mead to the Frozen Hearth in Winterhold. The delivery fee is yours to keep.
Candlehearth Hall is running low on our famous mead. Can you drop off this case? The gold is yours, as always.
Another case of mead needs to find its way to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. The delivery fee is yours to keep.
I suppose that risk always coexisted with his line of work, I just never thought his luck would run out.
He was a dear friend of mine and a surprisingly astute pupil of academia... I was devastated when he was killed.
I think you may have joined the wrong side. You showed yourself to be a true friend to the Empire today.
Ulfric showed his true colors today, eh? Don't worry. You aren't the first to be taken in by his self-serving lies.
I've had this bow almost my entire life, and it's never let me down. I hope it brings you the same luck.
Take this with you. I'm not certain if it will help within the walls of the Sepulcher, but I certainly don't need it as much as you.
If they choose to fear me in their ignorance, that is their choice. But it will not change what is true.
The people of Morthal would much rather weave their own horrid tales about my life than simply ask me for the truth.
If you could give me a healing potion, I could cleanse this poison from my body and get back to my life.
I don't mean to do this to myself, but I can't help it. I tried some skooma a year ago, and ever since then, I can't stop!
My job at the Riften Fishery is in danger. The owner, Bolli, said that if I show up for work in this condition one more time, then I'm out.
Isn't it obvious? As the Night Mother's Keeper, he believes he's entitled to the rule of this Sanctuary.
Ironically, the Night Mother could prove to be just as much a victim. The queen in a fool's twisted game of chess.
Cicero will cite our independence as the need to revert to the Old Ways. He'll claim we're undisciplined, unruly. Heretical, even.
It is called [QUOTE]Force[QUOTE] in your tongue. But as you push the world, so does the world push back.
Think of the way force may be applied effortlessly. Imagine but a whisper pushing aside all in its path.
That is [QUOTE]Fus.[QUOTE] Let its meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You will push the world harder than it pushes back.
Not within society, no. Many who practice within the school of Conjuration do so on their own, secretly.
Falion is the only one I know who is public about what he does. He was once my teacher here, but left the College years ago.
Oh... Oh no... Please, please... I ain't never harmed no one... Old Narfi just wants to be left alone...
Okay. I'll get this inside the Embassy for you. I've got to go. I'll find you at the party, don't worry.
One block lifts the other. Septimus will give what you want, but you must bring him something in return.
Pfft. You'd think an emperor would fetch at least twice that. Damn that motherless cheapskate, Motierre.
In any event, here's my advice. Go to Riften's Ratway, find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before, no?
Mallory is an expert [QUOTE]obtainer of goods.[QUOTE] We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, eh?
So says you. I think I've hit my limit on these things. Tell you what, one more and you win the contest.
So, it is done. Alduin dilon. The Eldest is no more, he who came before all others, and has always been.
Some think it's superstition, but I believe it works. I've yet to have a giant kill any of my livestock.
The cow, of course. Others do it differently, but I've found that an annual offering usually keeps the giants away from our livestock.
The attack will be launched imminently. Gather your weaponry and get to the front lines... Now, soldier!
We're there for information, remember? Trust me, I've been doing this for a long time. My way is better.
So that's your plan, huh? Even if you could survive, by the time you got inside, whatever documents they had would be long gone.
What of it, he says. Your Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos.
What of it, she says. Your Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos.
When my daughter Lash chose to leave the stronghold, I forged a sword to channel all my shame and grief.
Honor me with a task, outlander. Bring the sword to my daughter, if you see her. It'll be all she needs to know.
Occasionally. But an Orc blade is a very personal thing. Anger, regret, pride. All these things are put into our steel.
Why are you still here? You're supposed to be at Korvanjund, proving Galmar right, or proving him wrong.
You will release me - ro laan - if in return I promise to take you to Skuldafn and stop helping Alduin?
Ysmir's beard, you're right! No fish was ever caught by staying away from the shore. I'm off to see her!
But the Moot has not yet met to name her High Queen. And they won't. Not as long as I have any say in it.
Indeed, Elisif has become Jarl of Solitude, historically and conveniently home of the High King, backed by Imperial interests.
Come see me in Windhelm when this is all done. There's always work for those willing to fight for Skyrim.
Don't play dumb with me. Pay up, and you walk right through. Refuse, and you'll never see the other side.
Genius! And I'm sure you've completely worked out how to counteract complete dimensional collapse, right?
Hold on, you've given me a brilliant idea. Just as calipers hold materials in place, a soul siphon can hold magic fields in place.
Calipers? That's utterly ridiculous. Maybe long ago, you could just find calipers in every household across Tamriel, but not anymore.
Good thing she makes so much money. Makes it easier for merchandise like this to fall through the cracks.
Sure. How do you think I get my hands on the good stuff and offer it so cheap? You think old Maven is just giving it away to anyone?
Hardly! In fact, I don't know how I get anything done with all of the distractions I have to put up with.
Then there's Ingun Black-Briar. Bright young thing and a worthy apprentice, when she isn't wasting my rare ingredients.
My wife Hafjorg, well, she's a necessary evil I suppose. Not a lick of talent when it comes to alchemy, but she keeps me fed.
I don't know, Babette. Looks like he may have suffered a head wound. Best not let him out of our sight...
I don't know, Babette. Looks like she may have suffered a head wound. Best not let her out of our sight...
I hear you're in for life. Sad. I'd get a shiv if I was you, or maybe some Skooma to drown your troubles.
My advice? Serve your time at the pickaxe and get out. You don't want to end up getting a shiv in the guts over a bottle of Skooma.
I mean, it don't cost me anything to let you have one and the dead won't notice their stuff missing. heh.
Yeah, if your interested then I'll give you the book for free. If you like it you can come back later and I'll have other stuff.
I thought I was a goner just now. Thanks for the help, and if you need any supplies I have a few to sell.
If you deal with Nimhe, I'll let you into both the excavation site and my Dwemer Museum. What do you say?
I'll let you in if you agree to something for me. There's a giant spider in Nchuand-Zel. My workers call her [QUOTE]Nimhe,[QUOTE] the poisoned one.
Just one bottle per customer. Except for the man who saved the festival. Here's a couple bottles for you.
Many of the Empire's troops were Nords at that point. Some of them could even have been from around here.
I dream about those days still. Except I'm not me. I can see myself there and I try to stop what I know is going to happen but...
Mara's domain encompasses the emotions we strive the most to embrace; love, compassion and understanding.
It's difficult to appreciate her gifts in these dark times, but you should consider her light a beacon in the storm.
My knowledge of Skyrim's history is far from complete, but I did some research and discovered two things.
As I've said, I made some progress using the essence of dragon scales. But they're just not quite potent enough.
First you'll need to retrieve the dagger, then use it to carve a few scales off a dragon. Presumably a deceased one.
Second, there are stories of a dagger called Kahvozein's Fang, said to be sharp enough to carve individual scales off a dragon.
First, there are ancient references to dragon [QUOTE]heartscales[QUOTE]. What little I could learn suggests they may be what I need.
No, I need a name that will put some fear in the hearts of my enemies. When I have some enemies, that is.
Father says I should pick a name that describes what I really am,  but nobody's going to hire Erik Greenthumb or Erik Hoe-pusher.
No, she certainly wouldn't. And... for whatever reason, she chose to relay Motierre's information to you.
I don't know exactly what's going on here, if you're the Listener, or this is some fluke, or what. But what we now have before us...
Not enough to outweigh the loss of Riften. The whole south of Eastmarch would be open to Imperial attack.
Not exactly. The crown is what the Guild calls a paragon; an object that enhances our thieving abilities.
At least, that's what I'm told it does... there hasn't been a paragon in this Guild for hundreds of years.
Oh, you prefer to listen, eh? Of course, of course! The Listener listens! A joke! A funny joke! I get it.
Return to the pretender, tell her I'm dead! Tell her you strangled me with my own intestines! Ha ha! But lie! Yes, lie! Lie, and let me live!
Then listen to this - don't kill me. Let poor Cicero live! I attacked the strumpet Astrid, I did! And I'd do it again! Anything for our mother!
So now I'm stuck living here while those pigs she calls customers grope me and say the most awful things.
Ever since my parents died and Haelga took me in, it's been a nightmare. How was I to know she was such a wretched woman?
Work? I suppose you can call it that. I call it slavery. I work my fingers to the bone keeping this disgusting place clean.
So the Jarl thinks you can be of use to me? Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons.
So, my fellow beast, what do you want? Answers about the Forsworn? Revenge for trying to have you killed?
Sure, I understand. It's not easy to go from being executed by the Legion one day to joining up the next.
But I think you'll see that the Legion is Skyrim's only hope for real peace right now. I know you'll make the right choice in the end.
That remains to be seen. But if it is so, and if Boethiah appears, then we will welcome you as one of us.
The best tales are those of adventure. Who could truly write such a tale without first experiencing such?
I'm looking for a place called Bard's Leap. They say the echo of a song sung from there can be heard all the way in Solitude.
Why to perform for my common man, of course! Why should only the courts and inns of wealthy towns be given the gift of music?
Observing and capturing the epic struggle for Skyrim! When brothers clash with bitter blades, surely there is a song to be found.
Some may find their inspiration tucked away in tomes, or by carousing in the cities, but I find it here in the vast expanses of Skyrim.
The secret is my forge. It consumes fire salts, a strange mineral that burns as hot as Red Mountain lava.
Smithing's been in my blood for generations. I owe my success to my forefathers and their recipe for flame.
The what? Why how dare you! I will not be intimidated in my own orphanage! Get out! Get out this instant!
Very true. In our line of work, it's quite rare we set out to return a stolen item to its rightful owner.
Well, you see, the palace - Dragonsreach - was originally built to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name.
What? You want it for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers - don't you? I won't let her have you!
Yes, well. Perhaps someone else in the village can assist you? Please, you're starting to... frighten me.
Yes, well. Perhaps the proprietor of this establishment can assist you. Please, you're starting to... frighten me.
Yes. It all started when I was a boy. My father owned one of the mines. Rare for anyone who isn't a Nord.
He was killed. Guards said it was just a madman, but everyone knew the murderer was a member of the Forsworn.
I've been trying to find out why ever since. Gotten nowhere so far, and then I got married. Have a child of my own on the way.
I swore I was going to just give up, for my child's sake, but it's like my father's ghost is haunting me. Asking me [QUOTE]Why?[QUOTE]
You weren't nearly as successful as you think, fool. According to my scrying the Wolf Queen has returned.
You! You've got a lot of nerve showing yourself in this town again. What do you have to say for yourself?
A true killer, like me. The gods put us here to fill their halls with souls. You'll fit in fine down here.
But even the Blades didn't see the Great War coming. We underestimated the Thalmor, and they destroyed us.
They're the rulers of the Aldmeri Dominion - what used to be the Imperial provinces of Summerset Isle and Valenwood.
The Thalmor take the arrogance of high elves to the extreme - they believe they are the rightful rulers of all of Tamriel.
For a century or more, the Thalmor had been picking away at the Empire. Valenwood was the first, then the province of Elsweyr.
Every Argonian wedding proposal band is supposed to have three flawless amethysts as part of their design.
The amethyst in the center represents The Hist, the entity that all Argonians consider a sacred part of our lives.
Two of the gems, the ones on the outside, represent the couple to be married... one for the husband, one for the wife.
Fine. Don't tell me. But I know that look in your eyes. Someone who's faced death at the hands of the law.
Got a problem with a prisoner? Get a shiv. Hear Grisvar has a spare, if you could get him to part with it.
Small blade. Easy to hide. I mean, sure, you could just swing a pickaxe into someone's face, but people tend to see that coming.
I am one of the Afflicted. I'd have been dead from this plague a year ago if not for Peryite's protection.
I damn near met my end in that war. An Aldmeri soldier ran me through with his blade and left me for dead.
A healer named Jouane saved my life. He's been my closest friend ever since. I tell you, that man is a miracle worker.
Aye, that I did. I commanded a force of several dozen men, most of them levies from villages in this part of the hold.
I don't care what you think. The Empire put Maven on the throne for a reason. That's all you need to know.
I have. One of the old Akaviri records names a dragon living nearby. Shall we send the Blades to help you?
I owe you a debt, and I aim to repay it. We'll see each other again someday. For now, goodbye, and thanks.
I will make sure this gets back to the Jarl. Minus my cut, of course. Consider your name cleared, for now.
I'm sorry, Aduri, not this year. Perhaps next year after the harvest, I don't know. There's so much to do.
Painting won't put food on the table, but our crops will. Be patient Aduri... it will happen someday, I promise.
It's not going to be next year, nor the year after that! You just care about this farm more than you care about me!
Have you decided if I can head up to Solitude yet? I hear it's the best place to meet someone who may be willing to teach me to paint.
I've heard of him. My father had suspicions about his connection to the Mythic Dawn. Guess they were true.
I don't need this. My family wasted 8 generations keeping that Razor safe from a dead cult. As far as I care, it can stay locked in my house.
In return, you'll be required to defend the Twilight Sepulcher and everything within when the need arises.
More importantly, upon your death, your spirit will be bound to the Twilight Sepulcher as one of its guardians.
It was my pleasure, friend. In a way, I envy you getting to carry such a direct sign of Kynareth's graces.
It's about time they turned their gaze from the heavens, back to our bleeding homeland. What do they want?
Mercer must be brought before the Guild to answer for what he's done. He needs to pay for Gallus's murder.
No. No! Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but you take your orders from me. Are we clear on that?
The Night Mother may have spoken to you, but I am still the leader of this Family. I will not have my authority so easily dismissed.
I... I need time to think about all this. Go see Nazir - do some work for him. I'll find you when I'm ready to discuss the matter further.
Orchendor? Kesh knew him. He's an Overseer. Shepherd. Gathers the Afflicted, contains the festering wound.
Orchendor and his Afflicted are meant to stand ready, awaiting Peryite's command to cover the world with his Blessing.
Personally? No, not I. One of their number used to advise the Arch-Mage when I was but an Apprentice here.
But that was a great many years ago, before all the members of the order were called back to the Isle of Artaeum, and it disappeared entirely.
Summoned in spirit form is not raised from the dead. She'll need help before she can return to the living.
For the moment, the Wolf Queen has retreated to a place filled with dead eager to serve her. She has gone to her old Catacombs.
A few days ago, one of her servants busted through a wall into the Temple of Divines. We'll need you to go into the Catacombs themselves.
Technically, that is true. But I still report to the Aldmeri Dominion, and I cannot ignore this situation.
Don't worry, you can return to your petty squabbles and meaningless 'research' as soon as this matter is resolved.
Thanks. You and Sam drink too hard for me. Think I'll take my gold and go buy something for this headache.
Thanks. You and Sam drink too hard for me. Think I'll take my gold and go buy a nice bit of swamp in Black Marsh.
There are those in the Empire who would wish to evade their obligations to help root out the Talos heresy.
Fortunately, those most opposed to the Emperor's wise policy have now branded themselves traitors as well as heretics.
I am here to remind the ruling classes of Skyrim that their loyalty to the Emperor requires cooperation with the Thalmor.
There is indeed much that we know that you do not. That does not mean that you are ready to understand it.
Do not let your easy mastery of the Voice tempt you into the arrogance of power that has been the downfall of many Dragonborn before you.
This, as you can see, is our Sanctuary. You won't find a safer place in all of Skyrim. So get comfortable.
Well, what happens now is you start your new life in the Dark Brotherhood. You're part of the Family, after all.
We don't need your charity, Breton. If my girls deserve something nice, it'll be their father who buys it.
Good day, Lemkil. I saw some nice dresses for your little girls while I was in Whiterun. I'd be happy to purchase them, if you like.
We have lived in Skyrim since before the Nords came. Our way is simple, all work to make the tribe strong.
Only the bravest are allowed to lead, and to marry. A great chief is able to attract many wives and raise bold children.
Wise women like myself are mothers of chieftains. We guide the tribe and advice our kin on what is most pleasing to Malacath.
We left to help with the war and these filth bags swooped in and seized the place.  My family is in there.
What's the matter, friend? Khajiit got your tongue? Maybe you need a little ditty to loosen your gob, hmm?
There once was a stranger, with eyes full of danger, he spoke not a word, but his meaning was heard... Sing on, sweet Lurbuk, sing on!
Yes. Ever since mother died a few winters ago. I play songs and help with the drinks when I have the time.
You will? Thank you! Ten pinches of fire salts should give me all I need to bring this forge back to life.
Zok brit uth! I warn you, once you've flown the skies of Keizaal, your envy of the dov will only increase.
Ah, yes. You. I remember you. You're going to help? That's fine. Just... Just don't make a mess of my work.
Although it would benefit the Guild more than you can imagine, in the end, it would do more harm than good.
Ha! I do love it when the mortals know they're being manipulated. Makes things infinitely more interesting.
I do. A personal matter. My father died trying to negotiate with the Forsworn, back when that was possible.
They took his shield to those Hagraven beasts they consort with. I need you to bring it home where it belongs.
I warn you, it's dangerous work. No man of mine has ever faced a Hagraven and lived. I'll understand if you decline.
I think you've been taking things that don't belong to you. Pay your debts, and we'll forget this happened.
I... I am unsure. He is somewhere within the College. Surely one of your colleagues must know his location.
I am sorry I cannot provide you with further help, but this conversation requires a great deal of effort on my part.
If it looks to you like an impoverished slum, that's because it is. Ulfric prefers that we live in squalor.
Windhelm is divided into four quarters. The Gray Quarter is the one that's home to all the city's Dark Elves.
He has nothing but disdain for anyone who isn't a Nord. He tolerates us, but that's the extent of his hospitality.
Indeed. My reverence for Vaermina's machinations should not take precedence over our mission. My apologies.
The inner sanctum lies ahead. We must reach the Skull and put an end to Dawnstar's troubles. Lead on, my friend.
No, it can't be... oh my... and all this time, I was thinking he'd been unfaithful to me. I feel so stupid.
No, not until the Moot meets to choose another. And it won't meet until one side or the other wins the war.
Don't worry, though. Ulfric is our rightful High King. He'll drive out the Empire and Skyrim will have peace at last.
No, so your best plan is to follow him after he leaves Dragon Bridge. However, there is one other option...
We know there's an actual written travel schedule, somewhere in the Penitus Oculatus outpost. Securing that would, obviously, be most beneficial...
Now aren't you a strange one. Well, if you're here to shop, shop. If not, find some other caravan to stalk.
Oh, thank you, but I should be fine now that you've shown me the way. But those bandits have to be stopped!
See, there you go. Getting involved. Don't ask too many questions in Markarth. Safer for everyone that way.
That's what an old man gets for thinking the younger generation might be interested in learning some honor.
The Dark Brotherh... Oh. Oh! I... my goodness, you're really here! The Black Sacrament. It actually worked?
The only name I have is Niranye. Has a house right here in Windhelm. That's where you should begin looking.
The rebels are only inflaming the tension and weakening the Empire by distracting it from its ultimate aim.
I've been a daughter of Skyrim all my life. I love this land and her people. So do all the Nords that serve the Empire.
Ulfric, too, once. He wasn't always a self-serving ego-maniac. He fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion.
But Ulfric and his [QUOTE]Stormcloaks[QUOTE] are deluding themselves. If there's any hope of a long term victory against the Dominion, it's in the Empire.
Unfortunately, sometimes the stone of scholarship is built on the foundation of death. I'll inform the kin.
Oh really? Hmm... this looks like someone from Staubin's little group. A brave scholar, but not very wise....
If you find Staubin, it would be good to see any notes he may have collected. I doubt you'll find him alive, though.
Here, I usually pay researchers for their work when they emerge from the ruins, but they won't be needing it anymore.
Let's see. Ah, so that's what happened to Staubin. Tragic, but I warned him he was leading those people on a fool's errand.
We're expected to fight there tomorrow. Gjukar elected to camp here for the night. I don't like it, though.
Well, that explains why the guards let you in. Come on then, the Jarl will want to speak to you personally.
Well... I suppose in that case, it's okay to let you in. But only briefly. Be careful, and come right back!
I'll make an exception for you, but do not bring anything out when you leave. Too many dark deeds transpired in those halls...
If you really want to... Just be careful of the ghost! He snuck up on me once and scared me sick. It took a week for me to feel better...
What is there to know? It's in the temple, you bring it out. You bring it to me, I pay you. Now get moving.
When I finally became a priest, they gave me the new high priest's dagger, but I already owned my father's.
So you see, I have to return it. It breaks tradition, and I need to tell him that I finally did what he wanted.
I had to for honor's sake, but I had waited too long. My father died before he could see my training to completion.
Why don't you take it? We can always make another for the day when this war ends and Thorald can come home.
I'd had Eorlund forge this for Thorald. It was to be a present for his return. I suppose he can't have it now.
With Eorlund gone, I'm afraid I can't offer you much in the way of thanks. But please, take this. It's the least I can do.
You may have a point. It's getting difficult to even move troops around without attracting a dragon attack.
By all accounts the Stormcloaks are suffering just as badly. Even Ulfric might see the sense of a truce under these conditions.
I'll be the judge of that. Besides, by all reports the Stormcloaks are suffering just as much as we are from these dragon attacks.
A few years before Mercer murdered Gallus, the Guild took in a thief who specialized in dwarven antiquities.
The thief had broken into a nobleman's home somewhere in Windhelm and made off with a small figurine of a snow elf with crystalline eyes.
Ah, now that's a good idea. Head on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach is smarter than you think.
Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! Seems you are a cut above the usual brutes the Jarl sends my way.
Aye. A gift from the Black-Briars after they kicked the previous family out... place called Riftweald Manor.
He never stays there, just pays for the upkeep on it. Hired some lout by the name of Vald to guard the place.
But I swear upon Lady Mara that I will do everything within my power to prevent any harm from befalling you.
I will not lie to you, there is some risk involved. The last time the Torpor was imbibed could have been decades ago.
Exactly. One of the pieces stolen from her was a silver locket, a Cruel-Sea family heirloom. I want it back.
Fortunately, his identity isn't known to the authorities in Whiterun, so there's still a chance to save him.
The city guard in Solitude is seeking Arn for a serious crime. When he fled here, he was arrested for drunken behavior. Can you imagine?
Fralia, do you ever deal with the Khajiit at all? I'm sure they would love to trade in your husband's steel.
Plenty of people here that need Eorlund's craftsmanship, my dear. We've never had any reason to deal with those caravans of theirs.
Good! There's some gold in it for you if you succeed. Here's the meat - check the road just outside of town.
Good. If you see him, tell him Grosta said he can go straight to Oblivion... he's not welcome here any more.
He even has some wolves guarding it. I swear, I should just cut out his tongue. That would be the end of it.
He promised me, swore on his ancestors, that he'd give up the mead. And what do I find out? He's been stashing drink in a cave nearby.
He's been gushing about how talented Ingun is at alchemy. He'd never say it to her face; that's not his way.
I just think Elgrim's taken it upon himself to mentor the young thing so he focuses a lot of attention on her.
Oh! No, I didn't mean it that way. Elgrim can barely put his on his own shoes let alone have the energy to pursue a young girl.
I believe there is a laboratory in the east wing. If we proceed there, we should be able to locate a sample.
I swear, if I wasn't around, Elgrim would forget to eat his meals. How we make any coin at all is beyond me.
In fact, I need to arrange for someone to pick up an ore sample for me in Shor's Stone... goodness knows Elgrim won't lift a finger to do it.
I'm honored to be leading the latest generation of Namira's faithful. Those who have embraced what they are.
No. This coven has existed for thousands of years. Namira is a goddess. She has been worshipped since time began.
I'm sorry I mislead you. Return when this is over, and we'll talk about my involvement in the Thieves Guild.
If you can find him and focus his attention, there's a great deal Drevis can teach you about Illusion magic.
If you still feel like doing some jobs, I'm sure Delvin and Vex have more than their fair share to give out.
Either way, it's been a pleasure, my friend. Here's to the future of the Guild. May it last another thousand years!
I'll be down here, trying to coordinate everything with Delvin and Vex; to make sure the coin keeps flowing... and no one skims!
In your tongue, the Word simply means [QUOTE]Fire.[QUOTE] It is change given form. Power at its most primal.
Think of this as the fire builds in your su'um, in your breath. Su'um ahrk morah. What will you burn? What will you spare?
That is the true meaning of [QUOTE]Yol.[QUOTE] Suleyk. Power. You have it, as do all dov. But power is inert without action and choice.
It doesn't matter what I believe. Nurelion does, and it might be the only thing keeping him alive right now.
Leave, stranger. Evil stirs in this place. I fear for the security of the very land if it should break free.
Me? I'm Maul. I watch the streets for 'em. If you need dirt on anythin', I'm your guy... but it'll cost you.
The Black-Briars have Riften in their pocket and the Thieves Guild watchin' their back, so keep your nose out of their business.
Museums, keeps, estates... you name it. By the time Mercer took over the Guild we must have had a few dozen.
Before Mercer took over, Gallus started collecting every bit of material he could on locations the Guild could heist.
My errant formulas have cost Master Elgrim a fortune in ingredients; some of which are almost irreplaceable.
I'm aspiring to earn that title, yes. However, the road ahead is paved with loose cobbles and deadly pitfalls.
Master Elgrim says I'm a natural; that I have a unique talent. But I fear his approval masks his intolerance for my mistakes.
My only demand is that these vermin are permanently eliminated before my reputation is completely destroyed.
Oh, how reassuring! Most likely you're with the Thalmor and this is just a trick to get me to open the door!
Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend. Besides, who would ever want to harm such... Wait, it can't be.
She still mourns greatly for her husband, High King Torygg. So she leaves many of the courtly details to me.
So you're the newest member of our dwindling, dysfunctional little Family. I've heard quite a bit about you.
Stop. Turn around. And go back the way you came. Astrid is waiting for you. She's down near the entrance. You must have passed right by her.
That's what caused all the trouble. Soul gems are used in enchanting, but they break afterwards. Except one.
The cut they were giving me was good at first, but now it's time to clean things up. Go and take care of it.
You've proven reliable. There's a group of bandits in my Hold that I... may have had a few discreet dealings with.
The Falmer retreated underground and forged an uneasy alliance with the dwarves who ended up betraying them.
This betrayal made them what they are now... horrible blind monstrosities with a burning hatred of any but their own kind.
The Nords went to war with the Falmer in the First Era. Killed them by the thousands to drive them from their snowy homeland.
The first mortals that I taught the Thu'um - the first Tongues. The leaders of the rebellion against Alduin.
They were mighty, in their day. Even to attempt to defeat Alduin...  sahrot hunne. The Nords have had many heroes since, but none greater.
The kind that curse you, haunt you in the dead of night. There is nothing you can do, nothing anyone can do.
Shagrol, once the leader of this tribe, unhappy with his demise, has dealt with Malacath himself to curse me, curse us all.
The Poetic Edda is never truly complete. As a living history of Skyrim we Bards continually add parts to it.
In fact, If you collected parts of the Edda from any Bard you encountered in your travels I would be willing to pay you for them.
The ring itself is worth a few bits. Keep it as thanks for cutting off the last vestige of an unwanted fate.
Take my wedding band. Stuhn only knows why I've kept it this long. He'll recognize it. Tell him whatever you think will convince him to leave.
Their Voices are too powerful for anyone not trained in the Way to withstand. Even a whisper could kill you.
Tsk. How unfortunate. I had hoped you would honor an old man's dying wish. Well, let's be done with it then.
Very well. If you change your mind, you can usually find me here. In the meantime, feel free to look around.
Very well. Perhaps when my research is complete, I'll feel more comfortable discussing my findings with you.
We're looking for a fugitive who comes from Hammerfell. A Redguard woman. She may be somewhere in this city.
Well then, if you don't want the extra gold, you can certainly let Letrush keep it as a gesture of goodwill.
Well, well. Look at you. The Nords have turned you into an animal. A wild beast caged up and left to go mad.
Well, well. Look at you. Your kinsmen have turned you into an animal, Nord. A wild beast caged up and left to go mad.
What are you staring at, you worthless piece of gutter trash? I simply must start locking the doors again...
What I need? What I need is for Alain Dufont to die! I want him hunted down and murdered like the dog he is!
Yes, exactly! Most people don't know that it was originally built to hold a captive dragon - hence its name.
Yes, the Steward is taking visitors. However, I must accompany you at all times while on the royal premises.
You... you're an Argonian! Where did you learn to cook like that? Surely not in Black Marsh. Why even the...
You're probably right. I was hoping to avoid having to involve them in this, but it seems we have no choice.
Afraid not. But if you're serious about sharpening that tongue, you might try the Bard's College in Solitude.
Ah. Well. After a little incident with a roguish lad and the daughter of a prominent Thane... Well, let's just say, best not.
But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate the altar. Until you came.
Yes. It's an altar. Men would come and sacrifice the wretched in my name. The weak would be punished by the strong.
Can't say I've heard of any laws against... whatever that is you're doing. But I'll lock you up if I have to.
Consider it just more of the dirty work. I did my part getting them in there, now you need to clear them out.
Once Sabjorn is out of the way, Maven has plans for this place. One way or another, we don't want the pests coming back.
Course there's the Orc. Long-term tenant, that one. For what he pays, I could afford to shut this place down.
Nah, not so much. The odd traveler on the road. But mostly just old Fultheim, come to drink away a lifetime of bad memories, I'd wager.
Deliver the message to the warring parties. If they will listen, I will do what I can to bring them to terms.
Don't even say such things! I hope that dragon stays away from Riverwood. We don't need that kind of trouble.
Froki won't let me hunt on my own yet, but he never shuts up about killing his first stag when he was eleven.
Here are my notes about them. I'll gladly pay you for getting the pieces any way you can. No questions asked.
At least two of the owners, Ghunzul and Drascua, are dangerous marauders. And the third owner, Jorgen, I only know he lives in Morthal.
Hmm... looks like it's all here. Okay, go on through. But stick to the road, and don't make any sudden moves.
I am concerned about the Jarl's safety. Too many of our guards have been redeployed to fight the Stormcloaks.
What would you have me do? If we do not send men to fight in the war, you'll find yourself guarding one of Ulfric's men.
Nonsense. If Balgruuf falls, someone will take his place, for better or worse. In the meantime, we have a war to win. And win we must.
And if an assassin slips past the night watch, we won't have a Jarl at all. Without Balgruuf's leadership, Whiterun will descend into chaos.
I came here as a hatchling. The only thing colder than Skyrim is the Nords themselves, but we stick together.
I can provide you with help for her minions though.  This should help you deal with the Catacombs themselves.
Yes. I had Falk call you back because you were at the summoning, you have a connection to Potema now. You must deal with her.
I don't care what the Imperials say -- when Ulfric Stormcloak died, one of Skyrim's greatest heroes was lost.
Now at last, the Thalmor will get their way. The worship of Talos will finally be stamped out. Or so they think.
Oblivion take the Thalmor! I'll never give up Talos, not even if it means my life. Let them come and make me a martyr!
Those true sons and daughters of Skyrim will never cease to worship mighty Talos. If we cannot do so in our temples, we will do so in our hearts.
I said move along. The Forsworn are just a bunch of madmen. We have everything under control. Stay out of it.
I was apprenticed to Balimund before he died. He taught me everything I know about forging armor and weapons.
I've spent years watching his techniques and learning his tricks. Sadly, I don't think I'll ever be as talented as he was.
Balimund pulled me out of Grelod's orphanage when I was just a child. I don't know what he saw in me, but I was glad to get out of there.
I'll round up what men I can, and meet you outside Northwatch Keep. We'll get in and out as fast as possible.
I've been doing this a long time, remember? While the Thalmor's been looking for me, I've been watching them.
If the Key isn't returned to its lock in the Twilight Sepulcher, things will never be the same for the Guild.
As time passed, our luck would diminish to the point of non-existence. And whether you know it or not, our uncanny luck defines our trade.
Look, I never needed treasure. My father owns land; our family is wealthy. I just wanted adventure. Not this.
No. We're completely exposed. Bows and arrows are in short supply. Every building is made of thatch and wood.
I've given standing orders to the guards to prepare water bucket runs to the harbor in case of a fire, but that's all we can do.
Oh... what a terrible shame. Well, if you think you know where you left it and can retrieve it, I'll be here.
Should have left when you had the chance, friend. Now we're gonna have to spill your brains on the road here.
There are a few great strongholds worthy to talk about. Dushnikh Yal, Mor Khazgur, Narzulbur, and Largashbur.
There's an axe. An incredibly powerful axe. An axe powerful enough for me to have quite a bit of fun, indeed.
If you bring it to me, I'll grant you my boon. No strings attached. No messy surprises. At least, not for you.
In Rimerock Burrow, there's an artifact called the Rueful Axe. Bring it to me, and I'll take Barbas back. Simple as that.
As I recall, it's resting in Rimerock Burrow. Barbas can lead you right to it. The little mutt might even earn his place back at my side.
This old place? Been here forever. Built by my great grandda. Run by him, then all the way up the line to me.
Yes. Their history and culture is all around us in Markarth. A race of stonecutters, artisans, and engineers.
They invented machines and built elaborate underground cities where they researched powers to rival the gods themselves.
And then, at a time we are still not sure when, they disappeared. The whole people, all at once. Leaving behind only their works.
You should do as he says. Go to Malacath's shrine, northwest of here, and ask for his help. See what happens.
Yes, but he offered it as an idea. Perhaps he hopes it will be helpful, but does not wish to risk personal failure.
You're awfully inquisitive, aren't you? I like that. Perhaps you'd care to solve a little problem I'm having?
The Empire has agreed to accept our beliefs, and its citizens have a responsibility to cease their heretical worship.
It's a religious matter. The Thalmor do not recognize Talos as a god. He was only a man, and does not deserve to a place in our pantheon.
You're right, you're right. I just... I was sure it must have been them. If not the Thalmor, who? Or... what?
At this point they don't care what happens to her and neither do I. Best to just kill her and be done with it.
At this point they don't care what happens to him and neither do I. Best to just kill him and be done with it.
But the leaders of the uprising refused our offers of peace. They fled into the hills and became the Forsworn.
When the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Imperial City, the Legion all but turned a blind eye to the other provinces.
It was little more than a chaotic uprising, but the Reach was removed from Imperial authority for two years before we reclaimed it.
Many of the disgruntled natives of the Reach used the opportunity to depose the Empire, and founded what they called an independent kingdom.
Few outsiders earn the right to enter our strongholds. Speak with more respect, or we might forget your gifts.
Fly, my hunter. There are others who vie for my favor. A bit of competition. Don't dally while the prey flees.
Good. I'll spread the word that you've made reparations. Now let's forget the past and get back to business...
Excellent. Now we can get back to business. I think it's best we just forget this ever happened and move on, hmm?
He has knowledge of a cult of Talos. He will tell us what we need to know, or he will die. The choice is his.
He was told to run the scam on merchants, but he smelled the gold on you and his judgment went out the window.
Aye, that he was. And you sniffed him out because he broke one of the cardinal rules of our business... he got greedy.
Hold it. This here's a toll road, see? Yer gonna have to hand over, say, 200 gold if you want to use our road.
However, I can assure you that I will do everything in my power to keep you safe if you're willing to help me.
Apologies accepted. I understand how this entire story can be mistaken for fiction since the circumstances are so abstract.
I am Larak's daughter. Soon, I'll be of age and will be sent to marry an Orc chief in some distant stronghold.
Until then, I train. My new home will need strength, and my new sisters must know I am not weak when I arrive.
I can't wait around for you to make up your mind. I'll meet you at Kynesgrove. Don't waste time getting there.
I cannot tell you in detail. I never heard it used. Kogaan. It was the first Thu'um created solely by mortals.
It was said to force a dragon to experience the concept of Mortality. A truly vonmindoraan... incomprehensible idea to the immortal dov.
I say this without bitterness, for it was Ri'saad who saved me from a life of servitude aboard a trading ship.
I am grateful to have the life that I do now. It is a far cry from my days as an orphan on the streets of Corinthe.
He hired the others and paid for my goods. I am allowed to run the caravan, but I pay Ri'saad a percentage of my profits.
I was, to my shame. The whole court was in attendance. I've seen much in my time, but that was a gruesome day.
It all started here. This rebellion. When the Empire lost the Reach during the Great War, we became desperate.
We promised a group of Nord militia free worship in exchange for their help retaking the Hold. Then the Elves found out about it.
The rebels called it [QUOTE]The Markarth Incident.[QUOTE] It was the founding day for the Stormcloaks, and where this war really started.
We were forced to arrest all of them. Ulfric Stormcloak, their leader, used the whole thing as proof that the Empire had abandoned Skyrim.
It's also very illegal. Anyone caught with Balmora Blue looks forward to rotting in jail for a very long time.
Used to be a lucrative underworld commodity when Balmora was still standing. Now the stuff is beyond valuable.
Not sure. I know that it starts with Moon Sugar, but all sorts of other ingredients are added to increase its potency.
Malyn's soul is beyond hope because his body is dead. But I'll be keeping you just slightly alive on this end.
But be careful. If you die inside the Star, your soul will be disrupted. There's nothing anyone can do for you if that happens.
Maramal's been helping me through a rough patch. I just wanted to pay him back. It's not like he's keeping it!
Bolli, I was looking at the finances and I noticed you've been donating gold to the Temple of Mara. Are you out of your mind?
Uh huh. I'm sure he runs outside with the coin and throws it up in the air so Mara herself can catch it. Come off of it, Bolli.
You may be my wife, but this is my business, so just do your job. Don't worry, you'll still have plenty of gold left over to waste on trinkets.
Mostly it is the Nords. They do not like outsiders in their land, and so we are forbidden to enter the cities.
When they look upon us, they see only pickpockets and skooma dealers. It is most unfair, but we do our best to ignore them.
Nothing new there. Most of the Nords living in Windhelm don't care much for us, but Rolff is the worst by far.
He likes to get drunk and walk around the Gray Quarter yelling insults at us in the small hours of the morning. A real charmer, that one.
Nothing you need to concern yourself with. I shall be quite capable of observing everything that goes on here.
So, the whore thinks the Black-Briar reach ends at the border of Skyrim, eh? She'll soon discover her mistake.
Then you were well informed. I am at this very moment on the cusp of completing my magnum opus on the subject.
I'm calling it [QUOTE]Calcelmo's Guide to the Falmer Tongue.[QUOTE] It will revolutionize the way we understand those ancient beings.
They always hope to teach the Dragonborn to respect the Way of the Voice as they do. They never fully succeed.
You're Dragonborn. The rules don't apply to you. You can Shout the way dragons do... without training, through inborn instinct.
You'll have to make your own decision. It's a beautiful philosophy, but outside the seclusion of High Hrothgar, I was never able to hold to it.
Ah, a wanderer, yes? No? Pilgrim, perhaps? Have you come to commune with Peryite, Taskmaster and blighted Lord?
All right. But before I can put you to use, I need to know how much you can take. I have a little test for you.
And had they succeeded, Dawnstar's fate would be sealed. You have a unique way of looking at things, my friend.
Bashnag cursed me. I can't cast a spell to save my life right now. I'll have to wait until the way out is safe.
However, since it wouldn't behoove me to make you disappear, I'd rather have you on my side as Thane of Riften.
If you think you can steal my throne by winning the hearts of the people, that's where you're wrong. Keep that in mind.
As the Jarl of Riften, I feel it's my duty to honor your selfless behavior by honoring you with the title Thane of Riften.
Oh don't pretend to be modest. I'm talking about your new role as champion. Apparently, you've taken my people under your wing.
Much like Mjoll, you've become champion of our hold; helping people with their difficulties and providing assistance for their needs.
I found them near the old Dwemer bridge in the far west. I'll mark it down for you on your map for a small fee.
I mentioned how the Star is a soul gem, only it never gets depleted? There's another rule the artifact follows.
You can only store white souls in the Star, belonging to the lesser creatures. Azura's magic won't allow black souls to enter it.
As a mortal, Malyn's soul was black, so part of his work was breaking past Azura's rules. He was close before... well, I already told you.
I set up those targets a long time ago. I shoot at them from time to time. Don't want to get rusty with my bow.
I told you. I'm done with all that. There's enough blood on these hands. I'm interested in creating things now.
I'd also warn you not to cross her. She employs quite a few... troubleshooters  to take care of messy problems.
Lady Maven could buy or sell anyone in Skyrim. I wouldn't be surprised if she's the one pulling the strings around this city.
She's always welcome in Mistveil Keep and between you and me, I'm pretty sure she even has some pretty influential friends within the Empire.
I'm impressed. Forsworn usually make short work of mercenaries, but you took care of them. Here is your reward.
I've been trying to find new areas of business, trying to win the sailors' respect, but I keep having problems.
By inheritance, as my men are fond of saying. Can't blame them, my mother ran the Sea Squall as strictly as she ran the house.
Take the last trade we did. Some Fine-Cut Void Salts from the College of Winterhold. Plenty of coin if you know who to sell it to.
If she's come this far from home, it must be important. Lead on. I just need to report back to camp by sunrise.
Imagine hearing a story like that, over and over. Each time a different family Each time a different injustice.
Your meddling above ground reminded me of how removed I've been from the struggle. My men and I should be in the hills, fighting.
In fact. Keep it. I must have used up the magic in the staff or something. It's just a dumb stick of wood now.
Indeed I did! For a few septims, I'll tell you about some of the most interesting curiosities in my collection.
Look, before I have you help track Mercer down I need to know what you learned from Karliah. I mean everything.
Look, I know the others think I'm a bit daft for sayin' stuff like this, but I'm gonna give it to you straight.
Somethin' out there is piss-drunk mad at us. I don't know who or what it is, but it's beyond just you and me. We've been cursed.
Malyn's soul should be in the Star. Theoretically, purging him will be just like killing a ghost anywhere else.
I'll have a magical tether to your soul while you're inside. Once you're done, it'll be as simple as pulling you back into your body.
Not hate. Distrust and fear. The Blades have always sought to turn the Dragonborn away from the path of wisdom.
Once you get your hands on it, I want you to plant it in Captain Volf's footlocker. I'll take care of the rest.
You'll need to get your hands on some Balmora Blue from Sabine Nyette down by the docks. She's the first mate on another ship, the Red Wave.
Septim would later found the Empire that united Tamriel, but his first known battle and victory was right here.
That's right. In the Second Era, Tiber Septim himself led the army that conquered Old Hroldan from the barbarians of the Reach.
And this inn has the very bed the great general slept in on his first night as Old Hroldan's liberator. As good as it was hundreds of years ago.
Several months ago I ordered a special silver mold from some artisans in Valenwood by way of a Khajiit Caravan.
Well, it never arrived. Later I found out that it was robbed by a group of bandits led by someone named Rigel Strong-Arm.
She... really? That's... I wouldn't have dreamed. Of course, we need her in Markarth, then. I'll come with you.
Sure is. I've got another client -- wants me to do some enchanting. You can do the pick-up for me, if you want.
There's more enchanting to be done. You can acquire whatever it is and bring it back here, and I'll take care of it.
That was over 500 years ago. Nothing much down there now - but everyone's always convinced the cave is haunted.
The cave has a bad history. Long ago, Potema the Wolf Queen used it for necromantic rituals. That's where it got the name.
You mean the Dragon Bridge issue? I'll be honest with you, I was planning to let that go. Varnius is a bit jumpy at the best of times.
The only time I've heard it mentioned was when those Synod characters showed up some months ago looking for it.
Well, it's said to be very powerful. Has the capacity to store an incredible amount of magical power, as the story goes.
But it's more myth than anything at this point. I've no doubt that it actually exists, but no one has seen it in what, decades? Longer? I'm not sure.
To this day I've regretted allowing her to escape, even if it meant I had died trying. I owed Gallus that much.
The last thing I saw was Karliah dumping his body into a opening atop the ruins; an unceremonious end for a remarkable man.
Yes. For Sithis... and the Night Mother. You are the Listener after all, hmm? So let's not waste any more time.
You must be one of the new apprentices, then? Fine, fine. Just... just don't make a mess of my work, all right?
You should probably just take this directly to Faleen. Wouldn't want the old icebrain stumbling over the words.
You should probably just let Faleen read it herself. Don't want you stumbling over the words and ruining my flow.
All right, please stay close to me while we're inside. It should be safe, but it's always better to be cautious.
Am I! Free food and wine, and nobody trying to throw me in the dungeon. I wish they did weddings here every day.
Not really. It's just a bunch of elders standing around, looking important. I wish something exciting would happen.
Oh. Why... why certainly. I keep telling myself I'm not losing a son, I'm gaining an Imperial. Daughter. An Imperial daughter...
I most certainly am not. I've just lost my daughter to a Nord beast, and my nephew Titus is too busy playing Emperor to even show up.
I am, thank you. I do so enjoy singing at weddings. It's just one of the many duties we at the Bards College are called upon to perform.
Oh my, yes. I absolutely love weddings. I haven't found my special someone yet, but there's still hope. Vittoria is, well, getting up in years...
No, I'm not having a good time. My boy just married a gods-forsaken Imperial. Skyrim is full of eager Nord women, and he beds down with the enemy.
So far. I just hope things remain calm. Wine gets drunk, tempers flare. This may be a joyous celebration, but it's shadowed by a lot of animosity.
The best. Vittoria's a good woman. Any man should be so lucky. I know my father's not happy about me marrying an Imperial, but that's his problem.
Oh, yes. Presiding over the union of two lovers is one of my greatest responsibilities. It helps that Asgeir and Vittoria truly care for each other.
Aye, that's what the Falmer were known as long ago... before they became the blind monstrosities they are today.
Didn't take long for Enthir to find a book in the college's library that told of Irkngthand and a great statue with gemmed eyes within.
When Gallus took one look at this statue, he knew it was something special. He took it right up to Enthir at the College of Winterhold.
Because the rituals would last for months or even years, the Miasma was designed to slow down the aging process.
The Miasma was created by the priests of Vaermina for their rituals. It's a gas that places the affected in a deep sleep.
But I'll be ready when a new leader takes up the cause. As sure as ice is cold and stone is hard, I'll be ready.
I make no secret of it. I don't care if the Empire controls the city or not, I won't hide my loyalty to the dream of a free Skyrim.
Ulfric fought for that dream with more courage and honor than any Nord who ever lived. But now he's gone, and the dream is gone with him.
Does it matter? You're warm, dry... and still very much alive. That's more than can be said for old Grelod. Hmm?
Good. Follow me. We have to fight our way up. I don't think anyone else here is about to have a change of heart.
He stays in the Pelagius Wing of the Blue Palace. The doors are locked, and only Falk Firebeard can grant entry.
But I hear the maids, Una and Erdi, know how to enter it for cleaning. Surely they can help for such an important matter?
Hmm. Yes, it is quite sad. A young boy, Aventus Aretino, lost his mother recently, and was sent to an orphanage.
Why a little boy would want to contact a group of murderers is beyond me, but he is inviting evil into this city.
But he has returned home, and people have heard strange chanting. They say it's the Black Sacrament, the ritual to contact the Dark Brotherhood.
I anticipated the problem. While you were arranging this meeting, I was busy in the library of Sky Haven Temple.
I used to look forward to the day when I was of age, to see new places and people, but now it feels like a cage.
No. A chief's daughter marries who her chief wishes. It ensures the stronghold receives a fair trade in goods for my absence.
I was a member of the court during the reign of Torygg's father. It was Torygg who appointed me to the position.
In any case, if I can't get past the creatures in that room, I can't recover the treasure. I need more manpower.
In the end, we took back Markarth, but those damn Forsworn still stalk the hills and roads, looking for revenge.
Through neglect. During the Great War, they let the unwashed natives retake the Reach and declare their own sovereignty.
The Stormcloaks were forced to retake the Reach on our own, but that taste of independence emboldened them. And the Forsworn were born.
Let me at least give you something for your efforts... finding all of these couldn't have been easy... or cheap.
One of my main duties is to foster a better understanding between the Aldmeri Dominion and the people of Skyrim.
I also oversee the activities of the Thalmor Justiciars throughout Skyrim, although this has been unfortunately disrupted by the war.
Tell Delvin that he can count on me to provide the influence around here with the right people when he needs it.
You've more than proven that the Thieves Guild is back on its feet in our city and earned every bit of your reward.
If you're ever looking to sell any illegally obtained merchandise, I'd also provide my services as a fence. It's the least I can do.
Tell you what. Go ahead and deal with your business for now. When you're done, find me and we'll deal with mine.
Your guy's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens and paying us good coin for nobody to know about it. Well, until now that is.
The first time? Thieving. The second time? Thieving. The third time? Thieving. It kind of keeps going like that.
The infighting had taken months to subside which gave her time to go into hiding and carefully cover her tracks.
I spent thousands of septims and used every contact at my disposal, but it was as if she had simply vanished... like I said before, she was the best.
The vessels contain that very blood. Empty them and you remove any chance he has of regaining his former powers.
In life, Hevnoraak drained his own blood from his body. His goal was to transfer his power back into himself after death, becoming a powerful lich.
Then you know the hard looks as judgment gets set upon you. The sneers of people who never had to face sentence.
There's no greater honor than to serve. If you're serious about enlisting, speak to Legate Rikke in Castle Dour.
They're shadows of their former selves. They no longer remember their true purpose or their original identities.
With the Ebonmere closed, and their sudden severance from the realm of Evergloam, I fear they've undergone a drastic change.
Unbelievable! You must be the first person to set eyes on all twenty-four of them in... well, the last two eras.
Wait, where did you get this? This piece was thought to be lost forever, please take this with my utmost thanks!
Well, that's good to know. I suggest you tell your people at the College to keep a tighter leash on their mages.
Well. You surprise me. I was expecting you to favor Ulfric. Maybe this council will achieve something after all.
Well... yes. I mean, all of the gold didn't come from me. I have a silent partner that helped with the finances.
Yeah, walk away like a good doggie. Just stay out of the Black-Briars' business and maybe we'll give you a bone.
Yes. A map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear.
It seems to be spreading from the southeast, starting in the Jeralls near Riften. The one near Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds.
You're right, I saw it. But... how's that possible? Dragons don't exist... they're just stories from long ago...
About 30 years ago, the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Empire. It was a surprise attack, caught everyone off guard.
They ended up sacking the Imperial City. I was there, blasting apart young Elven men and women with Fireballs and Lightning Bolts.
By Akatosh, all the blood. The smell of flesh burned and pulled apart by magic. I never want to do that to another soul ever again.
Ah, there you are. Good, I was done speaking with that muttering fool anyway. We've got some business to discuss.
Anything. Served in the Legion with my sister, Ghorza, for over 10 years. We've seen every piece you can imagine.
Have you met her? She runs the forge near the smelter. Just don't bother talking to her apprentice. Boy has no talent.
But never mind all that. We're the Emperor's soldiers. We'll do our duty no matter what stands in our way, right?
By the Eight... you actually got your hands on it! This alone is worth more than some thieves earn in a lifetime.
Depends on what you mean by [QUOTE]busy.[QUOTE] I'm also the head jailor in the dungeon here. Quiet job, usually.
Do I detect a bit of jealousy in your tone? I would hardly blame you. What calling could be more noble than this?
I see in your eyes that you think I jest. I assure you, I don't. I am proud, and rightfully so, of the work we do here.
Working the soil with your hands, seeing your seeds take root and grow, tending a herd... there is a joy in honest labor you won't find elsewhere.
Good. Here's the outfit. Try to get Elisif's opinion on it and if she likes it mention it's from Radiant Raiment.
He said I was transporting weapons! For the war! In mother's coffin! He made me... open it! Indignity! Sacrilege!
He said I stole something! Me! Poor Cicero. A common thief. The very thought is insulting. One might even say... maddening.
He said I attacked someone! On the road! But it never happened. Never. Sweet mother and I were just waiting. My knife was sheathed!
He's the housecarl of Falkreath. You know what that means? He's the bodyguard to the Jarl himself. So be careful.
I knew he was troubled but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me.
I need you to help me show him the error of his ways by sneaking on board the Sload and planting some contraband.
I've done my part, Dragon Bridge will have extra guards. Falk Firebeard will find a way to take care of the cave.
I've risked life and limb so that you may create another masterpiece. Make sure to think of me when you use them!
Allow me to give you this, the fork I used the first time I tasted one of your dishes. Oh, and these ingredients I've been collecting for you.
I've seen him sneaking over to the Riverwood Trader to speak with her when I'm not around. He's wasting his time.
Camilla Valerius knows I'm the best man in Riverwood. That elf is kidding himself if he thinks she would choose him over me.
It means that the Burning of King Olaf, which the Bards College has held for time immemorial, won't be happening.
If she isn't convinced of the festival's importance then she won't reverse her decision to stop the effigy burning.
It means I can't read it to the court. Without the verse I won't be able to convince Elisif of the importance of The Burning of King Olaf Festival.
It was one of the great houses in Morrowind long ago. Whether that means I was one of them or not, I'm uncertain.
If you come across anything in your travels that might provide me with the answers I'm looking for, I'd be grateful.
Just one. I know when I was found by my Argonian father, I was wrapped in a blanket bearing the symbol of House Telvanni.
It would seem our adversary is attempting to take us apart indirectly by angering Maven Black-Briar. Very clever.
It's exhilarating to observe the effects of my potions on the body. Watching the heart stop... the eyes go blind.
We're made up of thousands of parts with thousands of different functions all working in tandem to keep us alive.
You ask why I'm so fascinated? The irony... the irony that the same world that gave us life provides us the means to die.
Yet if only a single part of our imperfect machine fails, life fails. It makes one realize how fragile... how flawed we are.
It's probably meaningless to you, but according to family legend it links our bloodline back to Ysgramor himself.
Now, if you'll just stand right over there, I'll cast a spell at you, and you block it with the ward. Here we go.
Tell you what, if you find the rest of them, talk to me again. Otherwise, keep it and maybe it'll bring you luck.
Look, I only buy things I can turn around quickly for a profit. And no one wants those stones unless they have the whole set.
The blood of our fallen heroes will make Skyrim free, never doubt it. Also, never doubt me or Galmar. Now then...
The only reason we're having this conversation is due to Brynjolf's assurance you won't botch another assignment.
He claims you possess some sort of uncanny aptitude for your line of work. Quite frankly I find that hard to believe.
The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot and yet I used it on you.
Without the antidote I administered, you'd be as still as a statue. I treated your wounds and didn't leave you defenseless.
They are rare things, I have one I picked up during my research of the Oblivion realms but it is a precious item.
We are special envoys of the Aldmeri Dominion, the rightful rulers of Tamriel. If you'd like I can show you why.
We may be rough, but we don't tolerate thieving around here. If that's your game, go join the lowlives in Riften.
Well, I know the Companions make their home here. Their mead hall, Jorrvaskr, is the oldest building in the city.
Oh, and there's a nasty feud between two families called the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns. You'll want to be careful there.
The rest you can find out by asking the townsfolk. I'd start with the barkeep at the Bannered Mare, or the castle steward.
Well, let's see... travel-stained clothes, worn soles, blank and unintelligent expression... Yes, in fact you do.
Well... I guess you could say I got on his nerves. I tend to be the voice of reason and he finds that... irksome.
He couldn't just kill me, you see. We're technically part of each other. But he was able to banish me from his domain.
Of course, because of our separation, Vile is now much weaker. I guess he figured it was a small price to pay for not having to listen to me anymore.
Wherever I can find them. If you're the type who worries over where something came from, you may want to move on.
Yes. A few months ago I received word from the Night Mother's Keeper that he had arrived in Skyrim from Cyrodiil.
The Night Mother's crypt, in Bravil, was destroyed. A result of the chaos caused by the war with the Thalmor. That forced a relocation.
I don't know where the Keeper has been these past few months, but I recently received another letter. He's bringing the Night Mother here. Soon.
You need to meet with him and give him whatever you think you can't live without while you're inside the embassy.
The Thalmor are paranoid and thorough. You won't get in the front door with anything but the clothes on your back.
You're learning, Dragonborn. Doing nothing can be the wisest choice, although strangely often the most difficult.
I trust that you will make the right choice, in the end. Listen to the Voice that Kynareth has placed within you, and your path will be clear.
Comes with living to a ripe old age, people start thinking there's something magical about you. Then, the insults.
Still, a little knowledge of plants and potions can get you by. Not that anyone likes to admit buying things from you.
See? I even have a little potion for the Steward. Mind handing it over to him? Just say it should solve that problem he has.
Elisif has forbidden the Burning of King Olaf, a Festival put on by the Bards College. We need to change her mind.
To convince her I want to read King Olaf's Verse. A part of the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Unfortunately the verse was lost long ago.
For your help, I'm sending word to the Orc strongholds that you're to be trusted. You should be welcome there now.
Good work. Here's your cut. I guess this finishes up our contract with the Silver-Bloods, so we'll be heading out.
Got a witchhunter in town, from the Priesthood of Stendarr. Keeps asking questions about that old abandoned house.
A witchhunter from the Priesthood of Stendarr is in town. He's asking a lot of questions about that old abandoned house.
Have you seen that Shrine of Azura? They say the dark elves built it after they fled from Morrowind. Sight to see.
He is quick to anger, and slow to forgive. One who wrongs Malacath is one who will endure great torment in return.
He demands loyalty and strength from his orcs. We have tried to please him, but he is now angry with us, and so we suffer.
Hear about the little Imperial boy, Aventus Aretino? The stupid whelp is trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood...
There have been whispers. A boy, up in Windhelm, name of Aventus Aretino. Been trying to contact... the Dark Brotherhood.
I was walking by the old Aretino Residence, heard the little boy, Aventus? He was chanting. It was the Black Sacrament, I tell ya.
Been talk of a little boy in Windhelm, name of Aventus Aretino. Get this - he's been trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. Foolish lad...
Folk been hearing some strange stuff coming from the Aretino place. Chanting. Talk is, little Aventus is trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood...
Have you heard about Aventus Aretino? He's a little boy, lives in Windhelm. They say he's been trying to get in touch with the Dark Brotherhood...
A little boy, Aventus Aretino, got sent to the orphanage. Now there's talk he's trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. No good can come of that...
I heard tell of a lad in Windhelm. Aventus Aretino. They say he's been doing the Black Sacrament, trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. Damn fool.
Here's your pay. It's never enough for what we do, but war gives us warriors its own kind of benefits, doesn't it?
Are you sure? It's rightfully yours, but this money could go to getting better weapons and armor, and making repairs to the settlements we control.
I am well aware. Tolfdir is still in Saarthal, is he? I shall be expecting a full report from him when he returns.
I knew he was troubled, but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me.
I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to cross blades with Vex again, but I certainly wouldn't mind a bit of a scuffle...
Something told me I wouldn't regret it. I had heard the Guild was back on its feet again and most of Skyrim under its belt.
I'm lucky enough that none of my friends have been killed. Of course we have soldiers coming through all the time.
I'm Sybille Stentor, court mage of Solitude, and according to my scrying you've managed to unleash Potema herself!
I've finally found you! I want to join the College of Winterhold. But I need help with my wards. Can you teach me?
If we were to... somehow... send a soul inside the Star. One that was ready to overpower Malyn from the inside....
Precisely. But it's not as simple as enchanting Malyn away. He's put up barriers. Souls are only allowed in, not out.
It didn't matter. The Imperial soldiers cut her down... killed her like a dog and left her body to rot in the mud.
I trained our daughter Lilija as a healer... to one day tend the Shrine of Talos and replace me as a Priestess of Talos.
And that's why I won't rest easy until every single Imperial soldier joins her, and Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim.
Lilija joined the Stormcloaks many years ago, when the first of the skirmishes broke out across Skyrim. I was so proud of her.
She served as a Battle Maiden, using her healing arts to help those that fell on the battlefield. Never even lifted a blade in her life.
When the fighting began over the White-Gold Concordat, she ran off to join the Stormcloaks. She had her father's fire, how could I say no?
She died out there, only having tended to the wounded soldiers for a few months. We never even found her body... the Empire burned all the dead.
Just be yourself. Eliminate the targets any way you see fit. Quiet, loud, quick, slow - whatever you feel is best.
Occasionally I'll give you a contract with certain parameters. Stay within them, and you'll earn yourself a bonus.
Just find a way in, get the information and leave. And you have permission to kill anyone that stands in your way.
Madesi was actually my original Saxhleel name. Unlike others, I decided to embrace tradition and keep it that way.
My daughter Fjotli... she was murdered a few months ago. Left her laying on the ground in a pool of her own blood.
I assume they were after her valuables... she always wore far too much jewelry in public. When I told her it'd be the death of her, I never thought...
Oh, I suppose. But you keep this to yourself; I don't want it being known that I go back on my trades. Understand?
Yes, you see, the thing is... I'm not concerned with [QUOTE]everyone's best interest.[QUOTE] I find I'm only concerned with my own.
She is a Daedra, a powerful being who watches from beyond our mortal plane. She has chosen you to be her champion.
This shrine was built by the Dunmer. As our land was scorched by fire and brimstone, Azura's prophecies led us to safety.
So did I! If the damn Stormcloaks somehow found one, or woke it up... the war might be about to take an ugly turn.
Hard to believe it was just a coincidence, that the first dragon anyone's seen for centuries attacks just as Ulfric was about to be executed.
Tell Erik that I've changed my mind, and we'll visit Whiterun soon to fit him for armor. And please don't hurt me!
Ah, I see. I've just remembered that I saved a few septims in case of an emergency. This is starting to feel like one.
Go ahead, hit me as often as you want. It's not going to change anything, other than to make me and the town guard angry.
Thank you for your help with Vals. Please, take this and leave me to see to Aunt Agna and my other family members.
Thank you. I'm still at the beginning of my lessons. Dean Six Fingers used to say I was quite good with the flute.
Thank you. I'm still at the beginning of my lessons but Inge... Dean Six Fingers... says I'm quite good with the flute.
Use the gloves to clear the focal points. Return to me when you have finished. I thought I made this rather clear.
You know, maybe I was wrong about you after all. Anyone who's smart enough to shut up and listen can't be all bad.
Your free will is an illusion. Whether you acknowledge me or not is your own business. But I will be in your mind.
Who do you think brought Septimus here? Who do you think protected you on your journey to open the box and loose my knowledge on this world?
A joke? Alain Dufont... a joke? I am a king on my throne, and you, my friend... you will die slowly, and painfully.
Falkreath's reputation has faded somewhat, but the graves remain, reminding us of the one inevitable truth of life.
Many battles have been fought here over the centuries. Graves were dug and monuments built, and the town grew around these.
In time, Falkreath came to be known as the heroes' graveyard. Many noble Jarls and renowned warriors asked to be buried here.
Haha. I knew it! No woman yet born has been able to resist my charms for long. Thank you, my friend. I owe you one.
I don't know really.  The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.
I should not have agreed to host this council. The Greybeards have no business involving ourselves in such matters.
I'll take your challenge, but if I win I get to start a new life as an adventurer, and with no objections from you.
I just wanted to try on your old armor, from back when you were a soldier. I thought I might be old enough to wear it.
Strong, yes, but how clever are you? I'll tell you what, if you can open the lock on my chest, you can have everything in it.
I heard you sneaking around downstairs last night. Were you trying to break into my chest again, son? I've told you to leave it alone.
I've told you a hundred times, I lock that chest for a reason. I don't want you getting a head full of ideas about adventure and glory.
I'm old enough to decide how to live my life, and I'd be honored to wear your armor, if you'd just let me. I'm strong enough to handle it.
I've got a shipment of Spices the East Empire Company is holding up. I need someone to convince them to release it.
If it can help us get inside the College, and reach Ancano, we'll have to hope that there's a way to stop all this.
If there's someone in the palace who can speak for you and wouldn't mind walking you around. Great. Lead me to him.
Incorrect. You can worship whatever gods you like. But Talos is a man, and only a heretic would think otherwise...
No. It's too late for the wardstone. Vighar must be destroyed. If this gets out, my family will suffer great shame.
Now that you've transacted the Oath, it's time to reveal the final piece of the puzzle to you; Mercer's true crime.
Only those whose Voice is strong can find the path. Come. We will teach you a Shout to open the way to Paarthurnax.
Oooh... So silent. So menacing. A true assassin of the old way. Cicero likes you. Oh yes, Cicero likes you, indeed.
Otherwise, I am uncertain what will end your Dreamstride. Perhaps when Vaermina's curious appetite has been filled.
I will watch over you as you slumber to ensure your safety. If I deduce anything is amiss, I will use my arts to bring you back.
So I ran away, and came home. And performed the Black Sacrament. Now you're here! And you can kill Grelod the Kind!
My mother, she... she died. I... I'm all alone now. So they sent me to that terrible orphanage in Riften. Honorhall.
The headmistress is an evil, cruel woman. They call her Grelod the Kind. But she's not kind. She's terrible. To all of us.
So, unless you wish a visit from one of their own, I'd suggest you follow your own advice and keep your mouth shut.
I should hope so. The Dark Brotherhood is also known to place contracts on those who associate with the Morang Tong as well.
So, you've done it. The men of violence are gathered here, in these halls whose very stones are dedicated to peace.
The conduit to Nocturnal's realm, the realm of Evergloam, has been in Skyrim... well, longer than recorded history.
The Twilight Sepulcher was constructed around it by man and mer in order to shield it from those who would exploit its power.
It's through this conduit that we're given Nocturnal's greatest gift, our luck. What she gains in return is a complete mystery.
We're stretched thin as it is with the war. Nobody has the time to spend on this. Not pleasant, but it's the truth.
Would you be so kind as to deliver the frost salts for me? I'm sure Arcadia will provide some form of recompense...
Ah, that reminds me. Speaking of alchemists, I have some frost salts for Arcadia. She asked me to obtain them for one of her potions.
I believe I am, yes. Technically speaking, of course. The city is also home to a priest, priestess, an alchemist, and I'm sure others who practice.
Yes, um.... So it would seem. Well, I won't waste your time. I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually.
I daresay, the work I'm offering has more significance than anything your organization has experienced in, well, centuries.
You want Garvey. He handles the keys for the Warrens. About the only thing that disease-riddled native is good for.
You'll have plenty of time to take it up with the King in Rags while you're serving a life sentence in Cidhna Mine.
You think you're the only one who knows that? We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you showed up.
You've done the Guild a great deed. And although they may not show it, I'm certain they appreciate your sacrifices.
You've finally become one of us. Come with me. I think it's time I announced my plans to you and your new brothers.
And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand boy?
And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand girl?
But his soul still resides within, protected by his enchantments. Until he is purged, my artifact is useless to you.
Greetings, mortal. You have followed my guidance through the veils of Twilight and rescued my Star from Malyn Varen.
He's a rogue mage who defected at the beginning of the war.  I turned him in but apparently he escaped and now this.
He's Solitude's priest of Arkay. He's the one who figured out Potema was still around. He'll help as much as he can.
I abide only those whose will is aligned to my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.
I have a purpose for which you might prove useful. But first I must test the deftness of your guile, and the strength of your purpose.
Do this and I shall remember you and bestow an important task upon you. Do this not, and I shall forget you, and your soul will waste in obscurity.
Make a thrall. Lure him to my shrine. Prove your will is stronger. Convince him to embrace the Pillar of Sacrifice, and then slay him without mercy.
I don't know. Rumor has it that she was murdered... butchered by a madman. I really try and stay out of such things.
Torsten might think Linwe or myself are responsible for Fjotli's death, but I can assure you nothing could be further from the truth.
I managed to pick the lock and slip out while the guard slept, but now I'm completely lost. Can you help me, please?
I need you to root them out and drive them away before they find me and drag me back to Hammerfell for an execution.
I am not the person that the people of Whiterun think I am. My real name is Iman. I am a noble of House Suda in Hammerfell.
The men who are looking for me, the Alik'r, they are assassins in the employ of the Aldmeri Dominion. They wish to exchange my blood for gold.
I think I have a few old spell books laying about. If you want more, you'll have to go to the College of Winterhold.
I told you I'm not hiring any more guards. Why do you people always bother me when I'm trying to finish my research?
In the meantime, I wanted you to have this. It belonged to Gallus, but given the circumstances I think he'd approve.
I'll make for Riften and scout the situation; see if I can discover what Mercer's up to. When you're ready, meet me at the Ragged Flagon.
My daughter was sent to the orphanage there when I stood accused of illegal necromancy. I had no choice. Run or die.
I joined with Bashnag then, but I thought of Savela every day. So I snuck off, hoping to find and steal away with her.
Only, she was gone. Shipped away to another orphanage, or adopted, or... I didn't know what else to do, so I came back, hoping nobody noticed I left.
Oh? What is this, some kind of herb? Are you sure? The Potage tastes perfect as it is. Any other ingredient might...
Other people just make things complex. Out here, Hern and I can get everything we need from the occasional traveler.
Please don't tell me that another one of the apprentices has been incinerated. I have enough to deal with right now.
Take for example, Ulfric Stormcloak and his little [QUOTE]rebellion.[QUOTE] But rest assured, his days are numbered.
The Legion's always been here. Without us to keep order, the provinces would fall into barbarism and lawlessness. Especially Skyrim.
The Code of Malacath. It is both tradition and law in the strongholds. Break the code, and you must pay Blood Price.
The code is not written anywhere. It is known and carried on by the Orcs, and all who live in the strongholds follow it.
For an outlander, following it is simple. Do not steal or attack anyone in the stronghold, or be ready to pay in gold or blood.
Yeah, rub it in. Just imagine what I could get done with my full power and none of these pesky [QUOTE]morals.[QUOTE]
Still, I've got this axe, and even if I can't use it, I'm sure someone would make a deal for it. Maybe I'll have a word with Molag Bal...
Yeah. I bet I know your guy. He's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens. Paying us good coin for nobody to know about it.
Yes. Are you enjoying our little walk together? Or perhaps you'd like to come back when the Lady is taking visitors?
I've been instructed to tell all visitors that the Lady Elisif isn't feeling well. She wishes you a good day, and please call again another time.
Your doom already binds you to your dark mistress, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand.
Do not mistake the night-shrouded thief's stealthily-taken spoils, stolen and unearned, for a warrior's plunder, won in honorable battle.
Your freedom? Yes. But even if you were to escape Cidhna Mine, your name would still be stained with all that blood.
A legendary crown, dating back to King Harald's time, or before. A powerful relic of a golden age, long since passed.
Whatever the truth, if Ulfric get's his hands on it, it would be a powerful symbol around which to rally support for his cause.
Legend has it that the crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and is said to increase the power of the wearer.
After that I thought I was turning into a wizard too, because dead things near me would come to life again for while.
I even went to the College of Winterhold. But they just laughed at me. The magic is in the staff, not in me they said.
See, my grandfather was a wizard. My father wouldn't talk about him much. But I found some of his things in the attic. Including this staff.
As you can imagine, I tend to forget things often. Leave things around. I really must learn to put these things away.
What I need is my Dwemer Stirring Spoon, my Orichalcum Ingot and my Grand Soul Gem. In fact, I could use them immediately.
Bring those items back to me and I'll be happy to experiment on you. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you.
But I cannot celebrate his fall. Zu'u tiiraaz ahst ok mah. He was my brother once. This world will never be the same.
But if there isn't going to be a wedding, the least you can do is give the ring back. That was one of my best pieces.
It's not about the money, really. I wouldn't have given you the wedding ring on credit if you weren't so obviously in love.
But then during their war with the elves, we had our moment. We drove the Nords out of the Reach in a great uprising.
Markarth and the Reach are our lands. That is why we are the Forsworn. We cannot claim the home that is rightly ours.
Then Ulfric and his men came. Those of us who didn't run were executed, except for myself, my king, and a handful of others.
Good. And while you're at it, perhaps you should sew your mouth shut when our fine customers are within earshot, hrm?
Oh certainly, dear sister. We couldn't afford to have our customers look like the simple pigs they are, now could we?
Sister dear, could you try sewing those sleeves a little tighter? We can't have our customers looking sloppy because of your work.
I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall. Since it's your home as well, I hope to see you and Brynjolf there.
Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities to [QUOTE]acquire[QUOTE] things from time to time. Can't afford to get rusty, now can we?
I've heard whispers of more of his work having turned up. If you can track it down, it may prove useful to all of us.
I've written some letters and placed them in a satchel. Perhaps you wouldn't mind delivering it to them on my behalf?
My parents live there. I usually make the journey to bring them gifts and to just say hello, but I haven't been well lately.
If you are, then you talk to the man himself. If you're not, well friend, you'd best walk away before this gets ugly.
If you are, then you make your way to Windhelm and talk to the man himself. If you're not, well friend, you'd best walk away before this gets ugly.
If you're need of goods, there's a market. If it's a soft bed and a hot meal you're after, there's Candlehearth Hall.
If you're looking to pass the time, you can give Calixto a few septims and gawk at whater oddity he's come across lately.
Lucan at the Riverwood Trader had his store broken into the other night. Oddly enough, barely anything's been stolen.
My name may not be on the label, but some of my blood, sweat and tears are in every drop. Uh, figuratively of course.
We've been staggeringly successful so far. In fact, I'm almost surprised how quickly she's generated business for us.
Yes, actually. I'm partnered with Maven Black-Briar. I put up a chunk of the gold she needed to get the place off the ground.
Not bad, but it's a little dull. How about you sharpen it up? Just need a bit of metal and the grindstone over there.
Oh, Rexus is no mere servant. He has been with the Motierre family since I was a child. I trust the man with my life.
Oh, yes! The prophecies make clear the signs that will precede the end times. One by one, I have seen them fulfilled.
Reyda! You saw Reyda? Did you tell her Narfi cries? Did you tell her Narfi never said goodbye like mother and father?
She is the Goddess of Dawn and Dusk. Azura sees into the Twilight of the future, and guides her followers through it.
Sithis? Let me guess: [QUOTE]In the Void![QUOTE] By the gods, you Dark Brotherhood are a predictable lot, aren't you?
Okay, here's how this works. You try to assassinate me, and I kill you. Horribly. I have done this dance before, you know.
That's really a shame - I was so looking forward to the wedding. You said you'd have all the most interesting guests.
Aw, what's wrong? Did the engagement fall through? Look, how about we call it even, as long as you bring back the wedding ring?
The last of the Nightingale Sentinels, I'm afraid. I've defended the Sepulcher alone for what seems like an eternity.
The sealed letter explains everything else, in detail. It should be delivered to your superior. Whomever that may be.
As I mentioned, the amulet I gave you is exceptionally valuable, and will certainly cover the costs of all these other unpleasantries.
The logistics of such an endeavor will be staggering, I know. There will be several minor assassinations necessary. Leading up to the... main target.
Those sycophants in the Temple would call her Kynareth. Just a pale shadow of the truth, like all the Temple Divines.
Kyne! Blessed Warrior-Wife. Shor's widow, sacred to any true Nord hunter. She's the mother of men and beasts, and her veil is the storm.
Yes. Although I rarely use my training. The Greybeards believe the Voice should be used only for worship of Kynareth.
I have... fallen from their strict teaching, but I still don't feel it should be used lightly. Not all of Arngeir's lecturing was wasted, it seems.
You jest, but they've been able to avoid identification for years. They're obviously well-funded, driven and patient.
You'll have to see the Jarl about that. Maybe his steward, Avenicci. I'm sure one of them will pay you appropriately.
A good many dark elves were driven from the city, and people became... uncomfortable with the presence of the College.
After the Oblivion Crisis was over, many felt that magic users were to blame. Elves, to be specific. It created a great deal of tension.
You may have noticed the College, just to the north there. Very prestigious place. Mages from all over Tamriel traveled here to seek knowledge.
A mercantile group that has established ports all over Tamriel. They pretty much dominate the whole shipping industry.
The Emperor himself supposedly backs them, which means they have fairly unlimited resources... so don't get their feathers in a ruffle.
And they got the orders backwards. Ha ha ha.  Yes, I'm writing that in.  It should be good for a laugh from the court.
Aye, the war keeps the Empire and the locals too busy to worry about us. Haldyn calls it [QUOTE]our golden age.[QUOTE]
Do not be so sure about that. Beware - the Blades may claim to serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have.
As for me, I kept from you only what you were not yet ready to know. Are still not ready to know, as your question reveals.
Don't know. Creepy fella, black robe. Couldn't see his face. Paid me a pretty sum to get that into your hands, though.
Fjola, my wife, left the farm on errands and never came back. It's been months, and I've been searching for her since.
Happy? No, I am not happy. Zeymahi lost ont du'ul Bormahu. Alduin was once the crown of our father Akatosh's creation.
Him? Oh... Ah, name's Balablob or Malaclob, one of them funny Orc names. Talks real good, though. Not a savage at all.
Said he's a writer. Don't know what kind of job that is, but it must earn him some pretty coin. He's paid up for the next few months.
He mostly just hangs about. Goes down to the lake, sometimes samples the stores of wine in the cellar. Man can do whatever he pleases, far as I care.
I think one of those volumes may have had some relevant information. If you want them, you'll have to talk to Orthorn.
I said not anymore. Orthorn stole a number of books when he ran off to Fellglow Keep to join those Summoners. Some kind of peace offering.
I tried to tell them. They wouldn't listen. Fools. It's all come true... all I could do was watch our doom approach...
I wish more had the dedication and strength of character that you demonstrate. I'll be sure this gets put to good use.
My family is everything to me.  Clear the fort and on top of the posted reward you can have whatever items you'd like.
Oh, a brutish one. Septimus has no fear of you. But as one block raises another, perhaps ourselves could help us each.
Only the ones I'm not sure about. This will prove your abilities, but more importantly, it will prove your commitment.
So you understand my fear. If Cicero's planning something, and conspiring with one of our own, it would be disastrous.
Sure am! I thank my lucky stars every time I look to the night sky that Maven took me in and gave me this opportunity.
The Empire might try an take the city back, or worse, we'll get a visit from a dragon. We've got to be ready for both.
Once things settle down, I'll be lookin' to recruit more guards for the city, then shore up our stores of food an' water.
Well, first an' foremost there's repairs to make an' wounds to heal. Folks are depending on us getting the city back in working order.
Very funny. My master is Clavicus Vile, Daedric prince of wishes. As you can imagine, he's quite the important person.
Vex was waiting for me at the Flagon when I came in... drenched in sweat. Everyone just took a look at me and laughed.
We have guests as often as we can but there aren't a lot of travellers these days. The war keeps people off the roads.
Yes, yes, so you said. But so what? The end is upon us. I may as well die here as anywhere else. I'm tired of running.
Yes. Braith bullies me all the time. All the elders think I'm a milk drinker 'cause I can't fight. Nobody understands.
If you can get Braith to leave me alone, I'll be your best friend... forever! I'll pay you, too! My whole life's savings - two septims!
You ask if I'm worried? I'm terrified, if you want to truth of it. But I have to stay strong for my wife and children.
Of course. Every night I pray that we don't get a visit from a dragon, or that two armies don't show up to fight over the bridge.
You what? How could you run out? J'zargo gave you more than enough. Bah, just forget J'zargo ever asked for your help.
You've come to the wrong city, then. Windhelm's a haven of prejudice and narrow thinking, unworthy of one such as you.
Ah, you're back. So, how went your first real contract? A bit more exciting than what Nazir's been offering, I'd wager.
Delphine? How do you... so you've finally found her, and she led you to me. And here I am, caught like a rat in a trap.
Do I? And what about you? What right did you have to meddle in my affairs? Kill my people? Was it worth it? Your truth?
Eldergleam is older than metal, from a time before men or elves. To even affect it, you have to tap into the old magic.
Glad to hear all my hard work has paid off. Maybe we'll fetch a better price for our crops next time we're in the city.
The last time I was in Whiterun, the tradesmen were talking about you. It seems your reputation as a businessman is growing.
He's making too much racket and I'm trying to get Vex drunk. So I tell him to keep it down and he just runs me through.
Got into a scrap a few years ago at the Ragged Flagon. Some idiot who stole himself a guard's sword and kept boasting about it.
Hmm... we've heard whispers of an enchanted pair of gauntlets, hidden and protected by dangerous men, beasts, or worse.
They are called the Forgemaster's Fingers. Bring them to our chief, and he will decide if you're worthy to be Blood-Kin to the Orcs.
I can't talk about it. Rest assured, the Jarl hears everyone's concerns. You will be able to visit the dead again soon.
I don't really have anything against her - not her fault that her husband Torygg was bought and paid for by the Empire.
I suppose she's Jarl Elisif now. She married High King Torygg just before Ulfric killed him. The Empire supports her claim to be High Queen.
But she's nothing but a puppet for the Empire now, with her husband Torygg dead. Ulfric will make sure she never takes the throne as High Queen.
I have met Daedra and Dwemer and everything in between and I know enough to see a vampire where others would see a man.
I know many things. I have studied things beyond the reach of most humans, traveled the Oblivion planes, seen things one should not see.
I thought you might not remember your first trip here. You had a big night. I think you've definitely earned the staff.
I'm taking mother to a new home. A new crypt. But... aggh! Wagon wheel! Damnedest wagon wheel! It broke! Don't you see?
Poor Cicero is stuck. Can't you see? I was transporting my dear, sweet mother. Well, not her. Her corpse! She's quite dead.
I'm with the Vigil of Stendarr. We believe this house might have been used for Daedra worship. Evil rites and so forth.
It's not wise to discuss it here. Please, if you truly wish to help, meet me at my home. I'll tell you the whole story.
Jarl Igmund sits on the Mournful Throne. You can find him in the keep, in the back end of the city inside the mountain.
More than you'll ever realize. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot.
Muiri? Muiri? So, what, you're the cow's champion? Oh, now that is rich. Well then, champion, let's get this over with.
Nchuand-Zel? The ruins underneath Markarth? The wealth of artifacts that I've based two human lifetimes of research on?
Now, that's it. One free outfit per soldier. You lose that, or get it banged up, you'll need to pay like everyone else.
Obviously. You should visit the Bloodworks to talk to Wuunferth -- we need to figure out where the evidence went wrong.
Peace? I doubt it. They may put their weapons down for a moment, but only to gather strength for the next bloodletting.
They are not yet tired of war. Far from it. Do you know the ancient Nord word for war? [QUOTE]Season unending[QUOTE]... so it has proved.
People say there's a man wandering the streets near the Blue Palace. He seems distressed but he's not making any sense.
Stick close. Damn rebels could be anywhere. Don't worry, though. General Tullius will have them on the run soon enough.
The Blackblood Marauders are... very identifiable. I didn't want anyone thinking the Blackbloods were getting too bold.
The Jarl can be found in the Great Hall, probably sitting on his Jarl's throne. Not over here in a wizard's laboratory.
The rebels have agreed to cease hostilities until we hash out this treaty. Suffice it to say I'm not holding my breath.
The gods have granted us peace for the moment. But that won't last long. I'm sure trouble will be stirred up soon enough.
For the moment we have ceased hostilities. We'll see what these Imperials have to say. I doubt we'll come to any lasting agreement.
Things are quiet for the moment. That won't last long. As soon as a new campaign starts, I want you there. Stay close. See me tomorrow.
There's one out on the road. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company.
They say they're too busy with the war -- I say what good is winning a war if we're still terrorized by one of our own?
Yes, I suppose you're right. Forgive me. I've lost several close friends to the Falmer and it tends to distort my view.
A word of advice, keep away from the Keep and the city guards. They follow their own path and have already forsaken Her.
Almost anyone in Riften is in dire need of those missives. Speak to them, child. You will know who will listen and who will sin.
And last is the soul gem. I left that one in Windhelm at the White Phial alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well.
The orichalcum ingot should still be in Winterhold at the Frozen Hearth Inn. I don't know why I didn't just take it with me.
Let's see. Last time I used the Dwemer Spoon was at my dear friend Boti's house in Ivarstead... Fellstar Farm I believe it's called.
As if this craggy, wretch of a city could give birth to a superiorly bred Mer such as myself. No, I'm not from Markarth.
I was sent here to lead the Thalmor's interests in this corner of Skyrim. It's my mission to root out all Talos worship in this city.
Bear in mind, even if you clear out the tomb, you'll still need a key to get to the treasure. A key I happen to possess.
Besides, you've done Maven a favor getting rid of him and saved me from wasting coin hiring someone else to do it later.
I thought it would be better to leave some of the details out of our previous discussion. Didn't want to risk you walking away from the job.
Dawnstar has a history of being the site of battles that have crippled the fate of the Empire. I hope this remains true.
The Stormcloaks are destined to win this fight. Talos is with us, and when you fight under a Divine's blessing, victory is assured.
Did she, now? Well, as it turns out, there are a few lingering contracts we haven't had the chance to complete just yet.
And more, dribbling in from time to time. I'll assign them to you as they become available. To be completed at your leisure.
Excellent! You aren't the first to have a change of heart, after seeing what Ulfric's reckless pride is doing to Skyrim.
From the Imperial City, our war here is just a sideshow. An interlude before the main event against the Thalmor resumes.
Most of the Legion is tied down on the border with the Aldmeri Dominion. The Emperor can't afford to risk weakening Cyrodiil's defenses.
Good. The dragon's soul should be making you stronger. Come back another time, and we'll track down another one for you.
While you're out hunting, keep a sharp eye open for any dragon scales and bones you might find. I'd be interested in looking at them.
It's good to see the Blades fighting alongside the Dragonborn once again. To think we're treading in the footsteps of thousands of years past.
Home? Home to me is a hot cup of ale at the end of the day and five minutes without someone needing something from me...
Cyrodiil is a beautiful place, full of diverse peoples and histories. But so too, Hammerfell and Skyrim, and every other place I've been.
Don't get me wrong, every country has its dark corners. But that's why we're here. To bring order and civilization, and to protect the people.
I don't need your jokes right now, but maybe you have a point. Maybe Camilla needs some help seeing Sven for what he is.
In any event, when Vici dies, it's going to be complete pandemonium. Best have your escape route planned out in advance.
Because of the current political climate, people are going to assume the murder is related to the bad blood between the Legion and Stormcloaks.
This is a public kill. How you do it is entirely up to you. Arrow to the throat? Knife in the belly? Your choice, so long as it's loud and messy.
In the time before man, they were known as the snow elves. They lived in the sunlight and had a very prosperous society.
Must have come from Mercer's place. He'd admired the Gray Fox for some time. Sure, I'll buy it from you... here you are.
My father was a Stormcloak soldier in his younger days. Now he just walks the streets spewing his hatred and propaganda.
My mother is the Priestess of Talos. She tends to the shrine and teaches his ways. I'm just not so sure she's delivering the right message.
Obviously, this treasure will fetch a good deal of gold, and I'm willing to let you share in the reward when we find it.
Oh, but Cicero can't talk to you. You've been naughty, naughty. I think you need to clear this whole mess up with Nazir.
With all due respect, Listener, you broke what few rules we seem to have. Nazir insists you talk to him and work this issue out.
Ah, don't worry, we all like to break the rules sometimes. Just see Nazir and pay the fine. Seems I do that at least once a month...
You disrespected the Brotherhood. And it'll cost you. You want back into the Family, you pay the price. 500 gold, and all is forgiven.
You may be Listener, and head of the Sanctuary, but your recent behavior sets a bad example. I must insist you pay a fine of 300 gold.
Idiot. I may not have a lot of rules, but that doesn't give you free reign to do as you please. You want to resume your duties? Go talk to Nazir.
Looks like Cicero's not the only only one to go a little crazy from time to time. Eh, Listener? You should talk to Nazir, work this whole mess out.
I do apologize, Listener, but Nazir made it clear the initiates are not to speak with you until you first deal with him, and atone for your actions.
Bah. If it were up to me, we'd cut off your hands and never let you back in this Sanctuary. But no. All you have to do is pay Nazir a fine. Pathetic.
If the Tenets were still in place, you would be required to defeat the Wrath of Sithis. Now you just need to pay a fine to Nazir. Ah, the Old Ways...
There are so few rules here. All we ask is that you don't disrespect your Family. But for some reason, you have. Best talk to Nazir and pay the fine.
When you disrespect your Family, you disrespect yourself. Don't you care for anything at all? Prove that you do - speak with Nazir, make reparations.
Return now to Nirn, with this rich boon from Shor, my lord: a Shout to bring a hero from Sovngarde in your hour of need.
Suit yourself. It's only of value to collectors, though. Good luck finding anyone else who will appraise it that highly!
That would be a bad idea. I'd be too likely to attract the wrong kind of attention. But they don't know you at all, yet.
That's wonderful. You've done us a great service. As promised the outfit is yours and here's something for your trouble.
They thought I was some other Redguard woman! They just wouldn't leave me alone. I hope they get lost in the wilderness.
We caroused together with Sam Guevenne, remember? We broke into the Temple of Dibella? How much did you end up drinking?
We were excavating this old tomb when we opened a chamber full of corpses. The team took one look, turned tail, and ran.
We'd be better off without the Silver-Bloods. They send their brute, Yngvar, to shake some coins from me every few days.
And Betrid Silver-Blood is always asking for more potions to fuel Thonar's [QUOTE]ambitions.[QUOTE] Gives him a temper fiercer than any bear.
You aren't going to pass. You're going to give me everything you have. Whether you leave here in one piece is up to you.
You... you were at Helgen. One of the prisoners. What makes you think I'm interested in someone like you for the Legion?
You'd really risk your life for a stranger's honor? I don't even know what to say. Thank you, my friend. I'll wait here.
A dragon... here in Skyrim. What's this world coming to? First the war, now dragons... trouble loves company, they say...
Although I have not practiced in a long time I was once a wizard. Even when I was young my magic was undeniably powerful.
It was that power that brought me to the attention of the Thalmor. In the Summerset Isles it is a great honor to be chosen to serve the Thalmor.
Better than nothing, I guess. But Tullius will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Riften without a fight.
Better than nothing, I suppose. But Ulfric will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Markarth without a fight.
But the Emperor canceled his journey at the last minute. Maro was smart, kept the Gourmet around, in case things changed.
Yes. Gaius Maro, on orders from his father, arranged for the Gourmet to come to Skyrim months ago. To serve as the Emperor's personal chef.
And so, the Gourmet has remained in seclusion, somewhere in Skyrim... on indefinite hold. Probably feels like a prisoner. But you'll fix that.
Don't bother me, peasant. I've had a long journey and paid too much coin on these gifts to be late to Vittoria's wedding.
Down at the docks. There are a few good spots, if you can avoid the East Empire Company workers and those Red Wave thugs.
Ha! I'm afraid the loot's already been moved. You've been useful to the Blackbloods, though. You've earned a quick death.
He used to live here in Riften at the Orphanage on the other side of town but I think he ran away. Can't say I blame him.
The only thing I heard is a rumor that a boy named Aventus Aretino, in Windhelm, has been attempting to contact the Dark Brotherhood.
I don't dare leave this unattended. Can you return to the College and inform Savos Aren of this discovery? Please, hurry.
I have no idea! This is amazing. Absolutely amazing. The Arch-Mage needs to be informed immediately. He needs to see this for himself.
I doubt the blessing's effects last for very long, so ask whenever you're heading out, and I'll perform the proper rites.
You're in luck. There is a blessing the Blades used on the eve of battle. It's supposed to prepare the mind for slaying dragons.
I staggered away from the ruins and my vision began to blur. It's then that I realized the bitch had poisoned her arrows.
Karliah was a master marksman and her greatest weapon was the element of surprise. I was lucky... she missed my heart by mere inches.
It takes half a day just to dig a planting row in the cold, stony earth here. But what else can we do, eat rocks and ice?
There's an old saying that only a Nord can work the soil in Skyrim. I don't think anyone else would have the patience for it.
It's a great big festival put on by the bards, every year. They burn an effigy of old King Olaf. It's quite a bit of fun.
But with the death of High King Torygg, the Festival has been declared [QUOTE]in poor taste.[QUOTE] So it looks like it won't happen this year.
The bards give out spiced wine during the festival, so they put in a big order. And then, for weeks after, demand is so high, I can barely keep up.
Listen you impudent cur. According to my scrying something happened at Wolfskull Cave that returned Potema to this world.
Now, your life as a Nightingale begins. Should the need arise, you'll be summoned to the Sepulcher in order to defend it.
We're not done talking. You fell for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers - didn't you? I won't let her have you!
You have something at your College, don't you? Something immensely powerful. Beyond anything I'd anticipated. What is it?
You shall have no Shield-Brother this time. But the spirit of Ysgramor goes with you, to restore the honor of his legacy.
You want to walk away? Fine. But there's going to be no justice for that poor woman. No one to care what happened to her.
You've done a larger service to the realm than you could possibly know. A resurrected Potema... I shudder at the thought.
By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Kin to the Orcs. Let it be known among the strongholds that you are family, now.
I don't believe it. You found the Forgemaster's Fingers. You've impressed me, outlander. No one else has returned from this task before.
Don't mistake my political beliefs as a substitute for my family values. They're still my parents, and I love them dearly.
I just think they've let my sister's death skew their outlook on Ulfric and what he really brings to the table with this war.
I'd... appreciate if you kept my opinion between us. The last thing I want to do is have my parents [QUOTE]lose[QUOTE] another child.
I'm not so certain that Ulfric's intentions are as noble as they think. I think Ulfric cares about Ulfric and the rest is a smokescreen.
Here you go. Oh, and keep it quiet. This stuff isn't exactly easy to get a hold of at these prices, if you catch my drift.
I know it's a bit strange. Not exactly a name to bring comfort to the sick and ailing who come to buy a poultice or salve.
That's why the inn is called Dead Man's Drink, the farm is called Corpselight Farm, and so on. I suppose it's sort of a running joke.
But what you must understand about Falkreath is that our town is defined, for better or wrose, by the large and ancient cemetery here.
I'm concerned that when this place is unsealed, the Miasma will dissipate and they'll awaken; both orcs and priests alike.
It's a smart man that demands something up front for his work. Some gold now and some when I have my dog. Here's the meat.
No, this was a specific one. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.
Of course I'm troubled. I'm on the verge of incredible wealth, but my cowardly work force ran at the first sign of danger.
The Greybeards are masters of the Way of the Voice. If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift.
There is an empty home in the city, but there was some... unpleasantness recently. I'm afraid it's not available just yet.
We need to find out if the Thalmor are behind the dragons coming back. We need to get into the Thalmor Embassy, somehow...
We need you to teach him a lesson by burning down three of the estate's hives and clearing out the safe in the main house.
Goldenglow Estate is a bee farm; they raise the wretched little things for honey. It's owned by some smart-mouth wood elf named Aringoth.
With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, the Imperial Legion will need to begin its preparations immediately.
You must find and kill Voltus Agallon. Doing so will disrupt security sufficiently that we will be able to, eventually, get to to the Emperor.
Security is being handled by a man named Voltus Agallon. His job is to travel throughout Skyrim, and ensure each city is prepared for Mede's visit.
Yes. Do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting.
There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro and the Stormcloaks in the Emperor's assassination.
Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the Feeble, in Whiterun.
Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up.
You did what was necessary. Alduin had flown far from the path of right action in his pahlok - the arrogance of his power.
You'll need to be careful with this one. The Jarl's men won't look kindly on you rummaging through the steward's quarters.
This will require stealth and discretion. The Jarl's guards won't take kindly to anyone rummaging through her Steward's private quarters.
And the excavations into Nchuand-Zel are dangerous. Dwemer machines and traps still function even after thousands of years.
To protect my research, for one. There are more cutthroat scholars out there who would steal my findings if they got the chance.
Ha. A few years ago, I said almost the same thing to a colleague of mine. Well, it turned out he was right and I was wrong.
He's an Argonian layabout, likes to scavenge shipwrecks. My guess is he'll run if threatened. Or swim, if given the chance.
I see... Well, the Legion will still be here when you change your mind. Rikke believes in you. And I'm starting to see why.
Consider this. What greater glory than to serve the Emperor and his citizens here in Skyrim, in these days of greatest need?
In there! Through the door. Some old Sanctuary, by the looks of it. I would have followed him, but I don't know the phrase.
Indirectly. The Trinity is usually selected from the ranks of the Guild although its existence is a closely-guarded secret.
Let them come! I have no fear, for Talos is my ally and I am his prophet. His word is upon my lips, his voice in my throat.
Listen, lad. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer... the leadership of the Guild.
Listen, lass. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer... the leadership of the Guild.
Look. I gave you a contract, and you completed it. Barely. Now let's go back to you being insufferable, and me being... me.
Some fool is opening a museum in Dawnstar. They say he's paying people to collect artifacts from that old Mythic Dawn cult.
Straight to the point, eh? No need for tedious hows and whys. I like that. Leave those details to your betters, am I right?
They started the Great War. Nearly destroyed the Imperial City. Then the Emperor took the coward's way out and surrendered.
Now you people dictate everything we do. Don't want us acknowledging a [QUOTE]mere human[QUOTE] like Talos as the god he is.
Your kind started the Great War. Nearly destroyed the Imperial City. Then the Emperor took the coward's way out and surrendered.
Now the Elves dictate everything we do, and they don't want us acknowledging a [QUOTE]mere human[QUOTE] like Talos as the god he is.
We believe the your efforts should be directed towards dealing with the aftermath, but we cannot predict what that will be.
We stand at the tomb of Hevnoraak, who has been dead for many generations. I fear, however, that his return may be at hand.
Well, least I can do is give you something for taking care of him. If you won't accept it as a payment, consider it a gift.
And just who in Mara's name are you, anyway? Hmm? Come here, telling me my business. And for what? To help a... a... a fool!
Changed your mind? Come with me. I'm heading to Riverwood. It's just up the road and my uncle Alvor is the blacksmith there.
First time in Markarth, traveler? Take my advice. You see anything, don't get involved. The city guard will take care of it.
Good, my experiments are at a critical stage and these are just what I need to finish. Here's some coin for all the trouble.
He was an Apprentice here at the College. Not very skilled, but got involved with a group of mages who took a liking to him.
When they left, he took off after them. Stole supplies and books from the College, I suppose as a way to ingratiate himself.
I was hoping you'd change your mind. Come on. I'm heading to Riverwood, just up the road. My sister Gerdur will help us out.
If you were to bring me the deed to Goldenglow Estate, so I was the full owner, that would be a step in the right direction.
It's an old Nord Tradition, a test to prove your worth in the eyes of Kyne. Show that you're a hunter and no simple butcher.
Kyne teaches us to respect the beasts and blesses the hunter who will face their champions. True Nord hunters are those who survive the Trials.
It's an old tree. Very old. They say it was a seedling when the first men were arriving from Atmora, thousands of years ago.
The sap is precious. It can restore barren fields or bring life to rocks. I can use it to repair the Gildergreen, so we can worship properly again.
It's not that easy. She'd go to the Jarl if she knew I was even remotely involved. You have to get it to her some other way.
Look, it's dangerous, but if you sneak the ring into her house. Put in a dresser or something. I will make it worth your while.
She's a maid. Old, and feeble. But with this contract it's much more a matter of [QUOTE]where[QUOTE] than [QUOTE]who.[QUOTE]
Your political affairs are your own, but any allegiance you may have in the ongoing war could very well affect your access to Fort Greymoor.
So you as good as admit you're working for the Imperials. Yet you walk in here, and ask to join me. What are you playing at?
That'll come in handy, yeah? An alchemy station, maybe a little garden with some choice plants. All right, consider it done.
That's a true Nord hero. A legend. So great that the Divines themselves lifted his soul into the heavens and made him a god.
They're stolen idols! Imposter gods, sold by silver tongues. No thank you. Froki will not forget Kyne, or her Sacred Trials.
This missive should convince him. Be aware soldier, these documents contain sensitive intelligence for the Jarl's eyes only.
We have it on good authority that Ulfric has raised enough men to attack the city of Whiterun. The Jarl, however, refuses the Legion's support.
Well, it was. Sadly, this forge is dying and I've used the last of my fire salts. If I can't feed it soon, it may grow cold.
Whatever damage has been caused can only be corrected by following the Pilgrim's Path to the Ebonmere and replacing the Key.
I'm afraid so. I'm weakening, and I can feel myself slipping away. The years without restoration of my power have taken their toll.
You have been chosen to be her champion. I know it is unexpected, but do not worry. It will all unfold as she has predicted.
Azura has given me the gift of foresight. I had a vision of you walking up the steps to this altar long before you were born.
You must understand. If Cicero is turning the others against me... against us... Our Family would not survive such division.
You. Mortal. You are worthy of speaking to. You have claimed the pieces of my Razor. It has been an amusing game to witness.
But Dagon does not declare a winner while there is a pawn on the board. Kill Silus. He and his family have served their purpose.
Ha. Don't toy with me. I may just have to seize my opportunity with both hands, ha ha ha. But we'll play it your way for now.
He's a vampire, and has blended into human society for years. He's never far from his female companion, Hert. Also a vampire.
The contract is for the male, Hern. But you'll probably have to contend with the female, too. So for Sithis' sake, watch yourself.
I am, and I don't want to hear your moral judgments about it, either. I wouldn't have had to study in secret in the old days.
I can't agree to any peace council until I know Tullius will be there. The other Jarls could take that as a sign of weakness.
I can't think of anyone better suited to return the Key. Just remember to keep your eyes open and walk true with the shadows.
I'll cut right to it. You murdered the old woman in the orphanage. You owe the Dark Brotherhood a kill. I've come to collect.
One of these poor sods has a contract out on their life. Which one is it? Any idea? Make your choice. Make your kill. And you get to walk away.
I'll try to hold to your hopeful purpose. Quickly, before this encompassing fog once more snares me in the World-Eater's net.
I'm afraid you'll have to come back later. I've been given strict instructions that no one be allowed to trouble Lady Elisif.
If you want to go to the trouble, feel free. I suppose I could offer you a bit of free Alteration training when you get back.
It's a sword. I made it for the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater. It's a surprise, and I don't even know if he'll accept it. But...
Aye, that I do. I've got to, if I hope to be as good as Eorlund Gray-Mane some day. In fact, I just finished my best piece of work.
Listen, could you take the sword to my father, Proventus Avenicci? He's the Jarl's steward. He'll know the right time to present it to him.
Last we have deathbell which only grows in marshy tundra terrain. Its inverted bluish-purple flower bunches are unmistakable.
Nightshade is native to the pine forest and marshy tundra regions of Skyrim and has a distinctive starburst-like violet flower.
Nirnroot is the easiest. It grows only by the water and makes a unique chiming noise. The only drawback is it won't regrow after harvesting.
Made a lot of coin, but I didn't care. I didn't really need it... I was running with them because it fit, made me feel alive.
I hooked up with a guild in Valenwood... I think they called themselves the Silver Crescents. Spent quite a few years doing jobs for them.
Muiri? I can't believe my family trusted that backstabbing little strumpet. You tell her she's dead to us. You hear me? Dead!
Now, you are going to speak to this... Monk... and find out why he is here, and then he will be removed from College grounds.
Really? Power? You're a dragonborn; you already have more power than most people who aren't immense, fire-breathing monsters.
Really? Power? Haven't you already killed enough of your foes using the more mundane means at your disposal? Swords, magic, etc.? How... uninspired.
There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro in the plot to assassinate the Emperor.
To earn your bonus, do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting.
When you've been doing business like I have for decades, you quickly discover that the only person you can trust is yourself.
Wonderful. Just speak to various bards outside of the college, get there parts of the Poetic Edda and return them here to me.
You would do this? Three vessels in the tomb below hold the power to vanquish Hevnoraak. Before anything else, we need those.
Bring them to me - but be careful, mortal. They are guarded by Hevnoraak's minions. They will stop at nothing to see their master return.
Ah, I have a pretty staff. Help me find Petra, wring her neck, pluck her eyes. Take my prize staff, I just want my tower back!
And make haste! You must be in place before Cicero and his... ally arrive! They could be planning another meeting at any time!
I don't believe so. But I'll be able to instruct you further after you've returned from the chamber. It depends on what you learn.
Forgive me. It's a term I haven't used in some time. While most in Tamriel call my kind Argonian, we prefer the term Saxhleel.
Forgive me. It's a term I haven't used in some time. While most in Tamriel would call us Argonian, we prefer the term Saxhleel.
He's the real head of this family. He may not be the eldest, but all the work that keeps us respected is handled by my Thonar.
I'd say it's time you put your nose to the grindstone and figure it out for yourself. You claim to be a thief... act like one.
Pick pockets, knock over houses... heck, I don't care if you have to bust into a palace. You do what you have to do to come up with the coin.
I'm not a coward, outlander. You want me to prove it? Fine. My axe is yours. To the most dangerous corners of Skyrim and back.
It ain't so bad. I miss living with my parents back in Helgen, though. Froki can't cook and there's nobody to talk to up here.
Keep Mother's staff. Think of it as payment. I want to leave everything from this cursed place behind. Goodbye. And thank you.
Luckily for you, there are more pressing matters. We could make an example of you, but perhaps you could be put to better use.
There's a sentry patrolling the area. We'll go in quiet and drop him with a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word.
There's a sentry patrolling the hill. We'll go in quiet and drop him with a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word.
With pleasure. Nature has a way of finding vengeance, though. You walk a bleak path, friend. One that will lead to suffering.
You ask a lot of questions for a mercenary.  Just get in there and open the gate, we'll try and provide help once that's done.
You'll find that in his office, in the Legion stronghold of Dragon Bridge. It's your choice. Now go, and may Sithis speed you.
Agallon is an efficient man, and will certainly already have begun his tour of Skyrim. Unfortunately, we don't have his schedule.
So, you've got two options. Try to find Agallon yourself, somewhere on his route between the major cities. Or... find and steal his schedule.
I called it home, now I know that was a mistake. I am, or was part of a coven serving the Hagravens that live here. So was she.
I don't even care any more. You want to check it out? Fine. I'll sell you the thing for fifty gold, and then it's your problem.
I have eyes within Dragonsreach. They tell me that all correspondence from other holds are sent to the Jarl's private chambers.
I'm here to assist anyone interested in joining the College. Also, my presence tends to frighten the locals and keep them away.
I'm seeking a small list of items to complete my next creation: two flawless sapphires, a mammoth tusk and a chunk of gold ore.
I've consulted my contacts regarding the information you recovered from Goldenglow Estate, but no one can identify that symbol.
In Whiterun, mostly. Ennis handles the business arrangements, but I know that he has a few purchasers who give us a fair price.
Ennis prides himself on his shrewd business schemes. For my part, I'm far happier working with cattle and crops than with people.
It's getting to the point where I have to scour Skyrim for untouched trees at the right size. Costs me too much time and money.
Have you ever seen what a bear does to the trees? They jump up on their hind legs and scratch them to bits... marking their territory or something.
Jarl Balgruuf? I don't mean to be disrespectful, as he's ruled Whiterun Hold well for years, but he seems in over his head now.
He's been trying to stay out of the war, but it can't last. He's going to have to pick a side. I'm afraid he's going to make the wrong choice.
Not enough to outweigh the loss of Markarth. With the Reach in enemy hands, our whole position in Solitude would be threatened.
Oh, very well. But my energies are low. I warn you - I won't be able to see much. Give me... five gold, and I'll do what I can.
Oh, you just don't understand. Without him, I am not free! Without him, I am doomed! All of his empire shall fall into chaos...
Our daughter, Fjotra, was taken from here. The Forsworn descended and... they didn't touch anything else. Just our little girl.
Right. Well. If you have some kind of official business with the jarl, I'm afraid now's not the time. Go on then. Off with you.
She's telling everyone she's sick. But she's really locked herself in her room because she fears an assassin is out to get her.
She's locked herself in her room not letting anyone in. Well, except for us servants. She's afraid of assassins coming to get her.
Even still, I make a point of announcing myself when I enter her room now. I spooked her so bad last time she almost threw the chamber pot at me!
Sorry's not good enough! Not while my Gleda is still out there, alone and afraid. You kidnapped her and sold her to that Giant.
They used to come from the Night Mother. Potential clients would perform the Black Sacrament, and she would hear their prayers.
But that was a long time ago. There hasn't been a Listener in years, not since Cyrodiil was overrun in the war with the Thalmor.
The Night Mother would communicate this to the Listener, who would then dispatch a Speaker to arrange the contract with the client.
But people don't know that. So they still perform the ritual... and we eventually hear about it. When someone wants us, we find out.
Very. I helped raise him. Oh, I could not have been more proud to see Torygg on the throne. He made a fine king. A fine king...
You're accusing me of taking part such a... such a... heinous act? I should have you arrested for even suggesting such a thing!
An impertinent question. The elf must die. Either carry out my will or do not. You are not the only mortal agent I could choose.
As a sworn priest of Mara, the elixir won't work for me. The Torpor will only work for Priests of Vaermina, or the unaffiliated.
Don't worry about them. We'll make sure they wash up safe. Maybe they'll even pay us for the heroic rescue from their sad crash.
Forsworn attacked a while back. Jarl had no men to spare, so the Silver-Bloods generously offered to send us to clean things up.
We just want that old native to hand over his land in payment for our services. Then we'll leave, and everyone can get back to work.
If you were expecting a palace, then maybe you're not cut out for this line of work. Our methods involve secrecy and discretion.
Indeed. But I abide only those whose will is aligned to my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.
It has a few final lines but that's all we needed to add. I need to head to court immediately and present this. You should come.
No idea, but whatever he did it must have angered Maven. No guard would lock up a Black-Briar without the old lady's permission.
No, it's the levers in the center there. Just make sure you don't pull the wrong one. Please, hurry. I don't like being in here!
The Ebonmere is a conduit through which Nocturnal influences our world. Not through magic or blessings, but purely through luck.
Varnius Junius stopped by here on his way to court. He was worried about something. I'm sure Falk Firebeard could tell you what.
Yes. Our order was founded after the Oblivion Crisis. We dedicate our lives to facing the threat of Daedra wherever they appear.
You and I have business to discuss. Ah, but you have not yet reported back to Astrid, have you? Do that, and then we shall talk.
You and your College have ruined years of my work, I've lost colleagues and friends to the Falmer, and you want me to calm down?
Ah, there it is! This little gold delight is going to keep us afloat for a while. Thank you. Here's something for your hard work.
First, I need you to clear the main chamber of those monstrosities. I'll stay here until you're finished, planning our next move.
Ha! All right, I'm writing that in. I'm not sure about the court but I find that much more probable than Olaf capturing a dragon.
He's just a little confused at the moment, is all. Knowing my master, he may very well reward you for bringing him to his senses!
Yes, but don't try to use force! He's far too mighty. He'd crush you like a clay doll, or drop you from the sky, or simply eat your brain right up!
Oh, but he probably won't do those things to you. Probably. Just remind him to come home, and... there'll be no fighting or unpleasantness. Probably.
Hmm? Ah, yes. That once held the shrine to Talos. But the worship of Talos was banned by the White-Gold Concordat, some time ago.
I asked the gate guards to look for him. I can't afford to chase him down but could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company.
King Olaf was Olaf One-Eye? He famously captured the dragon Numinex and took him to Dragonsreach. What do we say really happened?
Legend says this tomb holds a treasure that bestows great power on the one who discovers it. Beyond that, not much more is known.
Let's go talk with her. Stay close. Talk of assassins has the guards jumpy. They might attack you if you're not standing near me.
I bet she would feel safer. And hopefully you wouldn't have to baby sit her for long. Once she calms down, she might start thinking straight again.
It hardly matters though. The door to the stairs is securely locked. There's no way anyone without the key can get in. So don't you worry about it.
Well, she needs to eat. I don't think she even knows where the kitchen is. And milady isn't exactly going to remove her own chamber pot, now is she?
Magic. That's what they always want. Never history. Never the secrets of the lost races. No, just little spells and enchantments.
Rorik fought for the Empire in the Great War. He was gravely wounded, and so was brought before me. I was a healer then, you see.
Have you met Rorik? He owns these lands, and it's from him that our village gets its name. We have been friends for many years now.
We were as close as kinsmen, and when Rorik returned home I came with him. I am happy to spend my twilight years here with my good friend.
So polite! So nice! Cicero likes you. The Night Mother is sure to like you too. Oh, we're going to be fast friends. Fast friends.
So you know what it's like to have your life in someone else's hands. Why should they get to decide? Isn't judgment for the gods?
Strange. According to history Solitude attacked Winterhold, but Aesgeir seems to be saying Olaf reacted. What do we say happened?
The Empire's elven puppetmasters never cared much for the idea of a human becoming a divine. So the worship of Talos is outlawed.
Skyrim doesn't take kindly to being told what to do. And to try and forget Talos, well... they may as well ordered us all to cut off our ears.
Without you this would have been a disaster. I should have paid more heed to Varnius' warnings.  I won't make that mistake again.
You've done a great thing, today. It doesn't matter who you support in the war; Potema would have been a blight on the land for both sides.
You know, I'm beginning to respect you. Other than Aerin, you seem to be the only other person I've met I might be able to trust.
Since we share the same opinion of them, let me warn you that they're recruiting others to join their [QUOTE]guild[QUOTE] and you should be cautious.
You'll be doing whatever Rikke tells you to do. And, I expect you to find creative ways to disrupt the Stormcloaks along the way.
You'll be doing whatever Galmar tells you to do, and causing as much mayhem as possible for the Empire and any Jarl who supports them.
Ah, the prophecy. Be wary of prophecy. Some are meant as a guide. Some as a warning. Are you sure you can tell one from the other?
Alright... here you go. Should keep you light on your feet, and hold up decent enough if you wind up trading blows with the enemy.
Anything! Anything at all that might be of interest. That's why I adore this location... we have no idea what we're going to find.
And if, along the way, my message about the dangers of magic should happen to sink in for a few students, that would be a happy coincidence.
Can it be? You've brought me my amulet? Oh, thank Arkay. And thank you. Oh, dear friend, please, take this gold for your troubles.
Do you realize when the orcs attacked, I was only concerned with myself? I fled... and left my brothers and sisters behind to die.
And what would you have me say? Sorry for following the misguided teachings of a mad Divine? Sorry for stealing memories from children?
Ha. We'll see. I do have my eye on her, but she seemed a bit cold when I spoke to her earlier. Maybe just playing hard to get, eh?
I'm sending you to Serpentstone Island. If you survive, you pass. If you die, well, you weren't going to be much use to me anyway.
I've spent the last few decades living in regret and seeking redemption from Mara. And by Her Benevolence, I will right my wrongs.
It started slowly at first. Malyn would see things that weren't there. Then he would yell at students over words they hadn't said.
Then one day I walked in and Malyn had... killed a student, and in a horrific moment of inspiration, he started using her soul for his work.
Azura is no ordinary Daedra. She commands an entire realm inside of Oblivion. The more Malyn worked on the Star, the more she was able to damn him.
No! Don't pity me. I deserve whatever fate the Dread Lord has in store. I betrayed you... and now Maro has betrayed me. Fitting...
Oh, Cicero takes care of our Lady's body. Oils it, preserves it, keeps it safe. Makes sure nobody disrespects our Matron's coffin.
Oh, I know. I know. But I'm so glad you're here. Please, allow me to state my business. Surely your time is as valuable as my own.
I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually. I daresay, the most important work your organization has had in, well... centuries.
Only that they break an old woman's heart. So many friends, so many kin, all lost trying to rebuild a past that was over long ago.
That's not how things work around here. The Guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly.
The fool went absolutely berserk! He wounded Veezara, tried to kill me, and then he fled. I knew that lunatic couldn't be trusted.
The Jarl has put out a bounty on the dragon that's been terrorizing the countryside. Here, take a look at this decree for details.
The stone structure the Dwarves have left makes us invincible. Let the dragons singe a few carpets. They'll never topple Markarth.
These look like good quality, too. I know it's not the glamorous, heroic work, but don't be surprised if I ask you to do it again.
We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever soldiers he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt.
Well, I'm just surprised the Gourmet is a Redguard. I had you pegged for a Wood Elf, honestly. You know, because of your use of...
You'll need to speak with Mirabelle Ervine. Her quarters are in the Hall of Countenance, but she could be anywhere on the grounds.
A man's heart is his own burden to bear, so I will honor your request, though it casts a bit of gloom on an otherwise glorious day.
Could you... could you give her this letter, and say it's from Sven? I think I've matched that Nord's lack of cleverness perfectly.
I think the Bards College might be looking for recruits. You should speak to the head of the college, Viarmo, if you're interested.
Indeed. You don't get to the position my mother's achieved by blind luck... her business sense and diplomatic skills are legendary.
The entire town is being plagued by horrible nightmares. They're in serious danger but I'm afraid there's little I can do about it.
They are profane creatures with no hope of redemption. They lure innocents to their deaths and corrupt the souls of all they touch.
And their heretical artifacts grant powers to mortals that wreak havoc across Tamriel. They must be destroyed or guarded to prevent temptation.
Unfortunately, the future is as obscured to us as it is to you. The overwhelming power of the Eye makes it difficult for us to see.
What an amazing day this has been. I hope you're enjoying the festivities. I'm... I'm just so overwhelmed. Such kindness... for me.
What kind of cruel, horrible person are you? My sister was murdered. Do you have any idea what that's like? What I'm going through?
Yes, the school of Illusion can be quite influential. Kings have risen to power because of it, and empires have been razed with it.
Didn't take much to prove myself and knock them into shape. Now every free blade from here to Windhelm wants to sign on for a piece.
He's already dead. Worse, the enchantment keeping him intact requires black souls. I don't know how many people he must have killed.
If we don't do something, the enchantment will eventually fade, and the Star will slip back into Oblivion. Azura will have the last laugh.
However, as the head of the company it's my job to make sure we maintain good relationships with prospective partners and investors.
The East Empire Company has interests all across Tamriel, inside and outside the Empire's borders. We try not to get involved in politics.
I don't know for sure. I spoke out against the Aldmeri Dominion publicly; I suspect that's why these men were hired to hunt me down.
I managed to sneak past the guards and get this far, but... I don't think I can go on. I'm no warrior! Please, can you look for her?
I promise you, the thought crossed my mind. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot.
Keep an eye out for Imperials. They still hold this entire region. As long as we don't do anything stupid... we should be all right.
Madanach's guard. Big, even for an Orc. Heard he ripped a man's arm off and beat him to death with it. He's old-fashioned like that.
Oh by Azura, I've made a terrible mistake. I bought a gold ring, and Viola Giordano has been missing a ring that looks just like it.
Of course nothing in here is stolen. Only a careless, shameful, idiotic fetcher would do something as stupid as to buy pilfered goods....
Uncivilized, pelt-wearing axe-draggers. It's a wonder they don't still live in a cave like those ancestors they keep boasting about.
But it's one thing to take pride in your lineage, and another to cling blindly to the past. What they call honor and tradition, I call ignorance.
It's true the Vignar Gray-Mane and his lot are one of Whiterun's oldest and, depending on who you ask, most respected clans. I don't dispute that.
You idiot. Do you even know who I am? The most recognized scholar on the Dwemer in all of Tamriel, and you people keep bothering me!
I... I'm sorry I... I got too excited. I'm in the middle of some very... stressful work, and I shouldn't have yelled. How can I help you?
You should take it to Whiterun. Danica will want to see that the true blessings of nature lie in renewal, not a slavish maintenance.
You're a High Elf! I... I never would have guessed it. So many of your recipes are clearly aimed at the commonfolk. It just seems...
And finally, there's Colette. She may be... difficult to get along with, she's very knowledgeable when it comes to Restoration magic.
Aretino? Why that little bastard! You tell him I'm coming for him! And when I find him, it will be the beating of his miserable life!
Deeja and I are more like their representatives here in Solitude. None of the Blackbloods can show themselves without being arrested.
He's sending you after King Olaf's Verse then? That's good, we shouldn't leave it lying around now that I've figured out where it is.
The Verse was Svaknir's contribution to the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Each bard adds to the Edda in his or her time.
Hello there, friend. Have you come to enjoy the sights and sounds of this beautiful sanctuary, as I have? Truly remarkable, isn't it?
Honestly? I have no idea. But I've looked all over and the kidnappings here started around when she disappeared. So I have to hope...
I don't know. Beem-Ja has looked after me since I was knee-high to him. I need to rest, and then I think I'm going back to High Rock.
I... Well, I just can't believe the Gourmet is a Dark Elf. How difficult it must have been for you in Morrowind. The food there is...
Its sweetness is like a fair maiden's kiss on a starry night. And it's got enough kick to put a frost troll on his hind quarters! Ha!
Look, there's a war going on, if you hadn't heard. We barely have enough soldiers to walk the streets, much less patrol every corner.
Maybe so, but healthy paranoia has saved this Sanctuary before, and my gut's telling me that demented little fool is up to something.
No, I'm a Redguard. My family hails from the Imperial Province. Ah, but I left home when I was just a lad. Been wandering ever since.
Still, I don't want to cross Letrush. Tell you what. Steal the horse and deliver it, and you can have the second half of the payment.
That is correct. You see, Frost belongs to the Black-Briar estate. Technically everything in the estate is owned by my mother, Maven.
My plan was to take the horse from our lodge and deliver it to Letrush at the stables. Obviously, that didn't exactly work out as I'd planned...
We are here to guide you in that pursuit, just as the Greybeards have sought to guide those of the Dragon Blood that came before you.
Well now, you are a strange one. You remind me a bit of myself, when I'm stalking a deer. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that...
Well, like I told Delvin, I think we can help each other. You recover what I'm looking for and take out a rival Guild in the process.
Yes. There were others at first, but Azura's visions tested everyone's faith. One by one, they left. Afraid to know their own future.
But I refuse to abandon the shrine. The visions are a gift. Azura warns me of tragedy, war, death before it happens. I won't leave her guidance.
You look like you've just seen a ghost. Please tell me you haven't. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother... but she spoke to you?
You're one of us now, you see? A slave. The boot of the Nord stepping on your throat. Maybe if you understood that, I could help you.
You're one of us now, you see? A slave. The boot of your kinsmen stepping on your throat. Maybe if you understood that, I could help you.
Ah, yes, I can imagine you'd want to settle that score. Last I heard he was at the Solitude Docks, conducting the Emperor's departure.
I ran to the scene with other Legionaries who where stationed there, but the entire quarter was a smoking ruin by the time we arrived.
Everyone was dead. Wholesale slaughter. The Dominion, not content with killing dissidents at home, came to Hammerfell to finish the job.
Back in 42 I was stationed in Hammerfell, on leave in Sentinel, trying to track down some refugee relatives who had fled persecution in Alinor.
We're supposedly at peace now. But I put in to be stationed here to keep an eye on the Thalmor. I've a feeling they're behind this unrest in Skyrim.
Suddenly an explosion of magic in the refugee quarter. Thalmor mages were attacking the Altmer dissidents who were resisting with magic of their own.
I suppose you're free to frolic with the wenches in the servant's quarters, but anywhere else, you must have an escort. Jarl's orders.
I'm going up there to stop her. This cycle must end. I don't know what brought you here, but I could use your help, if you're willing.
I'm not certain how many scholars you're accustomed to dealing with, but I can assure you that personal wealth is our lowest priority.
I've been away from Solitude for as long as I can. But if you decide to finish these bandits off, you'll be rewarded for your efforts.
I've never been more sure about anything in my entire life. Someone like Grelod doesn't deserve to live one more day. She's a monster.
It's considered a great honor for the family. Their daughter will never know hardship, and the goddess blesses them with great bounty.
Kynareth has placed the Voice of wisdom within you, Dragonborn. All you need do is learn to listen to it, and your path will be clear.
Listen, lad. I have faith in you. I know that sounds strange coming from a thief, but these recent events have changed my perspective.
Listen, lass. I have faith in you. I know that sounds strange coming from a thief, but these recent events have changed my perspective.
My story, huh? Everyone in Cidhna Mine has a tale. Let's hear yours first. When was the first time you felt chains around your wrists?
Oh? True, I may meet my end in a dark alley with a dagger in my back. But the people have seen the truth, and they will not back down.
Terrible, just terrible. I vastly underestimated the heat transfer necessary, and have destroyed my only working model. I'm at a loss.
The Vigil of Stendarr cleanses all Daedric filth from Tamriel. Give us any artifacts you have, or we'll purge you like all the others.
This is a simple errand, but the time is right for it to be your Trial. Carry yourself with honor, and you'll become a true Companion.
Well, you are lovely to look at, and there's so many things I could teach you, but I'm afraid the Temple isn't taking in new students.
Yes, the incense. Fetch for me a deathbell flower, one silver ingot, a flawless ruby, and some vampire dust. Then I will show you how.
Ari gave me this dagger when we first started hunting together. Always said it brought her luck. You should be the one to carry it now.
As housecarl, my job is to deal with all dangers that threaten the Jarl or his people. So you have my attention. Now, explain yourself.
Don't mock it, pup. Even the lowliest beasts can kill the weak and arrogant. We'll try more powerful enemies next, if you survive this.
It was Aerin who found me dying outside of a Dwemer ruin. If he hadn't brought me here and nursed me back to health, I would have died.
When my strength returned and he told me about the problems plaguing Riften, I decided fate brought me here for a reason... so I stayed.
That was almost 150 years ago, and the pieces are still being kept by the descendants of that group. And they're right here, in Skyrim.
A little history, first. After the Oblivion Crisis, a number of groups cropped up dedicated to wiping out the remnants of the Mythic Dawn.
One of these groups found Mehrunes' Razor, the artifact of Dagon. They split it into three fragments and pledged to keep them apart forever.
Well, my family back in Hammerfell didn't approve of my interest in lethal poisons and death in general. So I left, and wandered north.
When I found this town, with its huge cemetery, I felt right at home. I opened the shop and I've never looked back. This is where I belong.
You there, please you have to help me! I was attacked by a vampire! Do you have a potion or something that can cure this before I turn?
Your quick mastery of a new Thu'um is... astonishing. I'd heard the stories of the abilities of Dragonborn, but to see it for myself...
A special type of soul trap. Placing you inside the Star without fully killing you. Once Malyn has been dealt with, I'll bring you back.
Ah, I forget you're new to Skyrim. Jarl Elisif, I should say, although only because she was married to Jarl Torryg when he was murdered.
Ulfric murdered Torygg, you know. Walked right into his palace in Solitude and killed him. Shouted him to death, if you believe the stories.
That's what started this whole war. The Empire couldn't ignore that. Once the jarls start killing each other, we're back to the bad old days.
Being a humble servant of Mara, I have little in the way of gold or coin, but perhaps I can offer you something better... companionship.
Damn it. What were they doing there? Imperial spies are everywhere. Never forget that...  I trust you gave them a thrashing? Now then...
Generally, if you want rumors, you should talk to Corpulus. That said... I did see a visitor pass through on his way to the Blue Palace.
He founded the Empire, and now they've turned their back on him. To appease the Elves. Elves! Do the Elves rule Skyrim, or do the Nords?
He founded the Empire, and now they've turned their back on him. To appease your kind, Elf. Do your people rule Skyrim, or do the Nords?
Hmph. When most would speak, you listen. You think. You understand that the only thing that matters is you following my orders. To kill.
I knew something was up. I'll make sure he doesn't disrespect this place anymore. Honesty is a rare thing to find these days. Thank you.
I'll let that comment go because you're new here. Ask things out of turn again, and we have a problem. Now, are we clear on all of this?
My books tell the stories. Have no doubt - as pretty as its streets are, as jovial as the bards may be... darkness is drawn to Solitude.
This city has a long history of madness and murder. The Wolf Queen... Pelagius... The death of High King Torygg... And now, public executions.
My daughter is the one who needs your pity. I'm just a poor Forsworn whose only regret is not killing more Nords before I was locked up.
My... associate will be pleased at your resourcefulness. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me.
My... associate here will be pleased to see your handiwork. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me.
Then what in Sithis' name is going on? Cicero spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Is this just more of the fool's rambling?
You look like you've seen your share of adventure. I envy you that. In fact, maybe you can help me with something. Will you hear me out?
You mean Roggvir. Yes. I made an appeal to Captain Aldis. He allowed Roggvir to have a proper Nord burial, as is the custom in Solitude.
Zu'u ni tahrodiis. It was you that lured me here and took me prisoner... vobalaan grahmindol. I have done nothing to earn your distrust.
Hmmm, Olaf did become king and Numinex escaped later. It's entirely possible... and I'm sure the court will like that, I'm writing it in.
I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-sister to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain.
I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-brother to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain.
I went to Windhelm to see the Shatter-Shields. They were old and dear friends, and... in mourning. Friga was killed recently. Murdered...
Do you know why Alain was in Windhelm? He heard about Friga's murder. He wanted to befriend the family, in their grief... and rob them blind.
Alain used me to get close to my friends. And now they all think I'm some kind of... monster. Alain Dufont took my life. And now I'm taking his.
Alain made all the pain just... go away. But it was all lies! Alain used me. He ruined my name, destroyed my friendship with the Shatter-Shields...
I met Alain in the tavern, while I was... drinking my sadness away. He was handsome, and charming. He said I was the [QUOTE]beautiful lily[QUOTE] of his dreams.
Not much, to be honest. Their return was a shock to us all. Giraud Gemane has some tomes about them in the library, if you're interested.
She separated from her husband several months ago. Now the two run competing mining operations. Beitild's angry and desperate. A fighter.
Suit yourself. I hate to turn away any friend of Hadvar, but in times like these... you understand if I can't just take your word for it.
Thanks to Maven Black-Briar, we still have some pull in Riften. But get arrested in Whiterun and you'll be tossed right into the prisons.
The only way to get that special job is by doin' smaller ones in those cities until we catch their ear... then they'll contact me and we're off.
If we can gain the confidence of someone very influential who lives there by doing a unique job for them, we'd be able to have some leverage there too.
The front gate is locked so you'll need to use the mine entrance behind us.  Open the front gate and we'll try and give you some support.
There you are. Took your sweet time dealing with Cicero, hmph? Now let's get down to business. Astrid told you about the Gourmet, I hope?
We're making sure your Emperor wasn't lying to his elven masters when he agreed the Empire would give up false gods and foolish beliefs.
We're particularly interested in the prevalence of magical seals placed on the tombs here. It's rather unlike anything we've encountered.
Well, I just never expected the Gourmet to be a Breton. It almost seems too obvious. Some of the greatest cooks have been Bretons, and...
I am the one cursed by Malacath. It is my burden. I bear it, and continue to lead, and the others see how strong I am. That is how I rule.
I think Giraud here would give you the best explanation of both it and the history of King Olaf's Verse. You should speak to him about it.
I'll present you as the sacrifice. Just play along. While mother begins the ritual, I'll strike. Then, together we can... we can kill her.
Names have power, lad. You should know by now. Just say [QUOTE]Velehk Sain, I release you.[QUOTE], and [QUOTE]Poof![QUOTE], I'm on my way.
Names have power, lass. You should know by now. Just say [QUOTE]Velehk Sain, I release you.[QUOTE], and [QUOTE]Poof![QUOTE], I'm on my way.
Not far, not far. This one looks upon it on clear days. Look to the west, at the foot of the mountain. The Dwarven ruins there. Bthardamz.
Thank you, hero. Now I may finally rest. Take Hevnoraak's iron mask. It may be of use to you, and serve as some reward for your feat here.
Vaermina resides in a strange realm known as Quagmire... a nightmarish land where reality shifts upon itself in seemingly impossible ways.
From her citadel at the center, she reaches forth to collect our memories, leaving nothing in return apart from visions of horror and despair.
Best yet, the Emperor will be lulled into a false sense of security, thinking an assassination plot had already been discovered and foiled.
Killing Commander Maro would do no good. Someone would merely replace him. No, we need him to remain in charge. But... distracted. Weakened.
Implicate and kill his son Gaius, and the commander will be grief-stricken and humiliated, his family name ruined. The security plan will then fail.
I don't think it's worth our time with the war going on, but if you want to clear out the cave, I'll make sure you're repaid for your work.
There have been reports of weird happenings near Wolfskull Cave. Travelers disappearing, odd lights. I suspect wild animals or perhaps bandits.
I left for a few days in Riften. When I came back Bashnag accused me of trying to sell him out to the Thalmor. I was cursed and chased off.
I'm a Thane. In the future, you may want to gain that information before talking with someone. Risk of looking like an idiot, and all that.
Many are our lord's lofty names, but they befit only us mortals. Intone her mighty names from now until the end of time - it is for naught.
The Lord of Plots, Deceiver of Nations, Devourer of Trinimac. The Queen of Shadows, Goddess of Destruction, He-Who-Destroys and She-Who-Erases...
Names mean nothing to our Lord. She only cares for those who care for themselves, whose hearts are full of purpose, whose lives are full of deeds.
That's... that's good of you. If you were to save her, I would be very grateful. I don't think there's anything I could give you, though...
Today we live by our own rules. We're the last Sanctuary in all of Tamriel, and only by forgoing the old ways have we survived for so long.
Very little. You have my word on that. The Night Mother represents a chapter in the Dark Brotherhood's history that has long since been closed.
My only worry is her [QUOTE]Keeper.[QUOTE] I'm not sure what Cicero expects to gain by bringing the Night Mother here, but he'll soon learn this is my Sanctuary.
What?! This is exactly why... don't they understand it's hard enough to fight a war without these juvenile attempts to undermine authority?
Yes, if someone were to put out the Lighthouse fire and then meet me on the docks afterwards... I could certainly direct them to that loot.
What an interesting idea. I think if someone were to do something like that, there would definitely be a certain amount of loot to be shared...
You'd be saving my life. Again. I know I probably seemed ungrateful... I've just been so scared. Expecting a knife at my throat any minute.
Hmph. Fine. Suit yourself. But you're wrong, anyway. Just look at the fool. I don't know what it is, but he's damn well guilty of something.
I understand, Listener. And I hope you understand that until the fine is paid, I must insist you refrain from all Dark Brotherhood business.
Not ready? Well, my arrogant little sibling, until you pay the fine the Dark Brotherhood holds nothing for you. No contracts. No rewards. No respect.
Oh, this is going to be fun. You've got to use your Wabbajack to defeat the enemy while - get this - they use their Wabbajack to defeat you!
The Prince of Plots usually gets what she wants. I'm surprised I'm not dead already. She must have had some reason to keep me alive so long.
You were ranting when you got here  but most of it was slurred. You did say something about Rorikstead . Maybe you should take a look there.
Your wish is my command! As long as it doesn't involve much physical activity. I seem to be having trouble staying on my feet at the moment.
Alright. This here's enough to keep your insides from spilling out, except from the fiercest of blows, and shouldn't weigh you down too much.
As I said, go speak with Gabriella. She's been assisting me with your next contract. This Emperor business, well... it does involve everyone.
As long as the Empire continues to uphold its treaty obligations, my government does not concern itself with the internal politics of Skyrim.
Hevnoraak planned his resurrection obsessively before dying. My duty in life and in death is to make sure he stays in this tomb for eternity.
I killed Torygg to prove our wretched condition. How is the High King supposed to be the defender of Skyrim, if he can't even defend himself?
The deepest doors of Dwemer listen for singing. It plays the attitude of notes proper for opening. Can you not hear it? Too low for hearings?
The rumors were true! You carry the one weapon Eldergleam fears - Nettlebane. I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it.
With the Skeleton Key missing from the Twilight Sepulcher, I'm afraid Mercer's seen to it that none of us can benefit from Nocturnal's gifts.
Years back, I had to ferret away some booty nearby. We'd sunk an Imperial Galleon off the coast. Good plunder, but we needed to travel light.
We stashed what we couldn't carry, and I hid it with a trick I know. I can point you in the right direction, and we'll each go our separate ways.
Burying the past is much harder than burying remains. I'm... I'm afraid of what you will think of me if I tell you about the things I've done.
But... I'm sorry, you should go. The children aren't up for adoption, and it's cruel to get their hopes up. Besides, Grelod hates... visitors.
Sadly, yes. Even the townsfolk have taken to calling her [QUOTE]Grelod the Kind.[QUOTE] Her very existence has become something of a running joke.
Grelod runs this orphanage because she's old, and set in her ways, and doesn't know any other life. These children need love, and comfort. I try...
I know. The poor girl's fright has left her bereft of reason. But there's no talking her out of it. I fear she'll be locked in there for days.
Not so ridiculous, really. I know people don't think much of her. But she is the Jarl after all.  Plenty of folk would kill to be in her shoes.
Locked. Damn! One of the hags nearby will have the key. You'll have to take it from here. I'll keep watch here - unless you can pick the lock.
There must be a way to activate these doors deeper in the ruins. Here, take this key. It should open the doors on either side of this chamber.
We prefer not to announce that the Sybil has died until we can introduce the new one. People like to know that we're connected to the goddess.
Well done, mortal. All things are in their order, and Orchendor roams the Pits. His betrayal will be punished, and your obedience is rewarded.
You don't know what you're dealing with. There will be consequences if you harm that tree. Leave this place - you're not welcome here anymore.
Be that as it may, we have no other choice. You need to remain unseen! Now go! Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.
Both Vittoria and her husband will be there for the duration, and everyone in Solitude is invited to attend. You'll have plenty of opportunity.
Soon. I'm not exactly sure when. But not to worry - the ceremony itself is being followed up by a public banquet that will last for several days.
For a time he served his purpose, but that time has ended. He uses my gifts for his own amusement, and the only amusement I tolerate is my own.
Here I'll show you on your map so you can stay away. Please, if you can help me let me know or get out of my way so I can try to find a priest.
I have watched you for some time, you know. The decisions you've made intrigue me, and I wonder if you are the proper agent for a task of mine.
I like to think I've aged well. I'm certainly wiser than I once was. And I know when one should speak... and when one should hold their tongue.
Let me handle that. You'll have a real invitation, don't worry. As long as you can act the part of a Thalmor toady, you'll get past the guards.
Oh ho. Now that's the Dark Brotherhood I know and love. This for business or pleasure? Ah, what's it matter, right? I'll see that it gets done.
That'd be great. There's a case of our soon-to-be famous mead that needs to get to Winterhold. Get it there, and you can keep the delivery fee.
We're quartered in the Hall of the Vigilant. Keeper Carcette heads Skyrim's branch of our order there, providing healing and justice as needed.
Why shouldn't I? The Falmer have killed more than a fair share of my acquaintances. They're animals... they show absolutely no pity or remorse.
Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! You already found it! You are cut from a different cloth than the usual brutes the Jarl foists on me.
As to Potema herself, find what's left of her body, likely a skeleton. Remove it from the Catacombs and bring it back to be sanctified by Arkay.
Don't let Tolfdir fool you; he's the pre-eminent scholar on Alteration. One of the best in Tamriel, and always willing to pass on his knowledge.
He had a way of enthralling people and built up a loyal army of followers. Good men fell under his spell and were forever twisted. Made... evil.
After that, fear was enough to keep them in line. He could torture and humiliate them and they would not rebel. Even in death, they serve him still.
If I hadn't heard it with my own ears I wouldn't have believed it. How could Astrid have done this to us? Strangely, I feel only pity for her...

More dangerous than you know. Left alone, however, he will awaken when he has grown too powerful to be stopped. This is the only way to be sure.
No, no, this one's alone on the road outside of town. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company.
Then I suggest you [QUOTE]collect[QUOTE] it. Until you pay the fine, you are effectively cut off from all Dark Brotherhood duties and contracts.
Yes, exactly. Well, I think so. It's certainly our best hope. The ancient Blades remembered much Akaviri dragonlore that has now been forgotten.
You're a Nord! I never would have guessed it! But where in the world did you learn to cook like that? Here in Skyrim? Or maybe somewhere less...
Do you mistrust poor Cicero? I am, as you say, just an innocent jester. A fool! Oh, but my work is not foolish, no. For I am our mother's Keeper.
Gallus once said he felt comfortable around me; able to let his guard down. I can't help but think that I'm responsible for what happened to him.
Good. This is Skyrim, and we should honor the old ways. These foreigners don't even respect their own gods, much less Kyne and her Sacred Trials.
Look how you sniffed out my little scheme at the North Gate. You knew it was a shakedown and you called him on it. That's what I'm talking about.
Oh, well, it's just... I never imagined the Gourmet was a Khajiit. You know, because of all the fur, and the potential for getting hair in the...
Skyrim is now host to giant, flying lizards and two-legged cat-men... and you're surprised by me? Yes. I just talked. And am continuing to do so.
The wood elf may run a stall in the city, but he retreats to the plains outside Whiterun to hunt. Kill him there, and no one will bear witness...
Ah, and let me guess. He wants his horse. Well, that's going to be a bit of a problem. You see, I don't really outright [QUOTE]own[QUOTE] Frost...
Don't you see? It was me. I set you up, wanted you dead. I betrayed you, the Night Mother... everything I hold dear. And now Maro has betrayed me.
It's just... Well... you're an Orc! Ha ha ha! If the people of the Empire only knew! I mean, now I understand your need for secrecy. Most would...
It's true, the scrolls are a subject of interest to us, and work has been done to learn of them. But outsiders are not allowed within the College.
No. Knowing they could never defeat the orcs, the priests of Vaermina released what they call [QUOTE]The Miasma,[QUOTE] putting everyone to sleep.
Okay, let's all take a deep breath. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Please tell me this is some kind of sick joke.
Ulfric and his thugs are stirring up trouble for their own agenda. The Empire is the only thing keeping the Dominion from walking all over Skyrim.
It matters little if some of the people here are ignorant to that truth. They are still citizens of the Empire. It's our solemn duty to protect them.
Well, I don't mean to seem disappointed, but... I just never figured the Gourmet was an Imperial. I had dreamed of something more exotic, maybe...
With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, his security service, the Penitus Oculatus, will need to begin its preparations immediately.
Security is being handled by a Commander Maro. Astrid and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple the Emperor's protection.
You are to slay the commander's son, Gaius Maro, and once he is dead, plant false evidence on his body implicating him in a plot to kill the Emperor.
Amusing. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to continue my research. I have no time for idle chatter with any simpleton who strikes up a conversation.
Brynjolf, huh? Lemme guess. He plucked you off the street and dropped you into the thick of things without tellin' you which way is up. Am I right?
Ha! Oh, that's a good one, friend. Killing Lurbuk... I mean, can you even imagine something so ludicrous? Depriving the world of my unique talents?
I guessed right! I... I always imagined the great Gourmet was a Wood Elf. You see, only someone with a knowledge of woodland herbs could combine...
Oh. No, no, no. Don't you understand? Guilt, innocence, right, wrong.... Irrelevant. What matters is I ordered you to kill someone, and you obeyed.
Yes. The Torpor grants an ability the priests of Vaermina called [QUOTE]The Dreamstride[QUOTE]; using dreams to travel distances in the real world.
Haven't you talked to Astrid? She's by the pool, greeting the Night Mother and her little jester. She has a contract for you. Come see me afterward.
If you've come to Solitude to join the Legion, speak to Rikke. If not, just keep your nose clean while you're here... or you'll end up like Roggvir.
Indeed. For you, my friend, seem to understand what's truly important. When I give an order to spill blood, you follow it. No questions. No remorse.
Ooh, you're a wizard! I mean, you cast that spell just now, yeah? I was hoping you could make me invisible or something. Can you? Make me invisible?
They'll never think to check it. Who in their right mind would hide inside? Now go. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.
Yes, Yes. It is an ancient and ruined city. Built by the Dwemer. The dwarf folk. It is nearby, but I'd stay clear. People say it is quite dangerous.
Heh. Chamber fit for a king and all that, right? No problem. Give ya a big bed, decorate the room real nice, maybe even throw in a few extra baubles.
I'm not exactly... comfortable around guards or jails. Definitely not when associates of mine have been locked up. No, I'll meet you outside of town.
If you don't mind digging, I own the Quicksilver Mine. It's a better life than working in that damned Iron-Breaker Mine with all those milk drinkers.
It matters not. The plant cares nothing for the rays that bring it the warmth of the sun. As you carry Dawnbreaker, so will my light touch the world.
Not much to it, really. We fish, and keep to ourselves. Try to keep from upsetting the Empire or the Stormcloaks, and so far the war's left us alone.
Oh, yes. A secret family recipe. The only good thing my father Octieve ever did. In fact, it's so good, no one else in Skyrim even tries to make any.
Really? Great! Okay. So, first, you raise your ward and I'll throw a little spell at it. That way I can see the [QUOTE]right[QUOTE] way to do things.
Right. The leader of our fight against the Empire. I forget that most people don't know what he looks like, except for those Imperial wanted posters.
Yeah, we can do that. I'm thinking a sewer grate on the outskirts of Dawnstar. Leads to a tunnel, then inside. You'll be in or out, quick as a coney.
Oh! Well, you tell your Stormcloak friends [QUOTE]hello[QUOTE] right back at them! This is a day of healing! Legion, Stormcloaks - all are welcome here!
You've not heard of the Gourmet? Author of [QUOTE]Uncommon Taste[QUOTE]? He's a wizard with a spatula. Well, not an actual wizard, but his recipes are legendary.
