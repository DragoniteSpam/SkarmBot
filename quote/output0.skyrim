...
Good job!
Hail, Galmar.
Hail, Ilfhild.
Hardly likely.
low grim laugh
So far, so good.
Look out! Draugr!
You hear anything?
Korvanjund. Remember?
Now let's keep moving.
You see a lever anywhere?
All for an old crown, huh?
Hrongar will know my meaning.
Balgruuf will know my meaning.
What in the nine holds is that?
The rest of you lot are with me.
You have your orders. Get moving.
Just shut up and keep out of sight.
Ralof... get away from there, fool!
It's the rebels! Defend the entrance!
But there isn't any other way through.
Damn dustmen! Why don't you stay dead?
It must be the Stormcloaks! Find them!
Draugr. Ain't you ever seen one before?
Time to show what you're really made of.
Enough talk. Let's go kill some Imperials.
My pa always warned me about these things!
I don't like it. What are they waiting for?
Don't give them a chance to warn the others!
Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.
That crown must be here somewhere. Keep looking.
The Imperials will be sorry they got in our way.
We're not leaving until we get what we came for.
Careful, boys. There's bound to be more up ahead.
How's it going, Unblooded? You find anything yet?
Hmm, looks like this is as far as the Imperials got.
Maybe you can find a way through somewhere above us.
Pick a man and put him down. We attack on my signal.
Listen up. Those Imperials aren't here by coincidence.
What? Get over with the rest of the men at Korvanjund.
Come on, boys. Let's spread out and see what we've got.
No. And I'm not sure I'm better off for it now neither.
Ah! The Hall of Stories... we must be getting close now.
My pa always warned me not to mess with places like this.
Men who understand each other often have no need for words.
Keep your wits about you and watch your shield brother's back.
There may be some way to get through on the level above. Hurry!
That's done it! Alright, boys, let's get moving. We've got more...
Looks like the door will open if we turn these rings the right way.
Is there anything on the claw that might show how to open this door?
Yes. An axe. How long have you been in Skyrim. Give the man my axe.
I wouldn't do that again unless you know for sure it's going to open.
Keep a sharp eye out. There's no telling what we might run into in here.
Keep your wits about you. The Jarl of Whiterun is known for his temper.
Get yourself kitted out with what you need. Welcome to the fight, brother!
That's the way I like it. Short and bloody. They never knew what hit them.
Too bad we can't read these carvings. Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?
Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. No telling what we'll find down here.
Careful. No telling what will happen the next time you mess with that door.
If he keeps it, I will bide my time. If he returns it to you, it means war.
Keep looking, Unblooded. There's got to be some way to get that thing open.
Let's hope that's the last of them. Come on, let's see what's down this way.
The crown must be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes open.
Steady now! They may be uglier than Imperials but they'll go down just the same.
We'll stick around here for a while and see if we can find anything else useful.
Not so sure? Oh, then perhaps we should take a moment to look around a little, eh?
One thing at a time. We're here for the Crown. Any of these carvings show a crown?
Get to Windhelm with the crown as quick as you can. Tell Ulfric he owes me a drink.
If you don't mind king, we'll just be taking that crown of yours and be on our way.
Unblooded, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open.
Hmm... that looks like some kind of claw from a statue. I wonder what it's used for.
Don't wait around for me. I bet I'll beat you to Korvanjund even though you start first.
Maybe that claw has a clue on it? You know, how to turn the rings so the door will open.
Steady. A few dusty bonewalkers aren't going to stop us anymore than the Imperials could.
We had the advantage of surprise this time, but things won't be so easy from here on out.
But do not make the mistake of underestimating the Legion. Plenty of them are Nords same as us.
No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut up or you'll blow our ambush.
Follow me. Quickly and quietly now. I want their guts on the ground before they even know we're here.
Oh... I've heard of this. They say these walls show the history of the ancients who built this place.
Gretta, Engar, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Imperial reinforcements taking us by surprise.
Ulfric Stormcloak is counting on us to bring him back that crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do.
Imperials? Well, if they're keeping themselves comfortable, let's slip in and send them to their graves that way.
You sure about that? Then please, be my guest and go strolling on in there. We'll stay here and watch your back...
You there, Unblooded, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting.
I don't like the look of this. Perfect spot for an ambush. Ten to one they're just waiting for us on the other side.
Their spies must've found out we know about the Crown, and they don't want us to have it. But they won't stand in our way.
Even if one of these pictures tells us where the Crown is, I'm betting we're going to have to find a way through that door.
See what you can figure out, Unblooded. I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something.
Cold as the inside of an ice wraith. That and some Imperials are camped out around the entrance, staying nice and warm around their fires.
I know some of you are ex-legion and may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and they will not hesitate to kill you.
Ah!
Aha!
Ahh!
Oaf.
Wow!
Ahhh!
Grrh!
Help!
Phew!
Woah!
Mercy!
Nuh...
Yield!
Agghh!
Attack!
Hsssss!
Hunh...
Whoops.
A fight!
Aaaiiee!
Close...
Bad idea.
Get away!
Gods, no!
Watch it!
What the?
Hssssssss!
I knew it!
Ouch! Hey!
Uh, sorry.
Why you...
Why! Why?!
Damn shame.
Damn you...
Die, beast!
Die, N'wah!
Dragonborn!
Is it safe?
Son of a...
Die, dragon!
Good enough.
I'm on fire!
Just... die!
Not so loud!
Yield to me!
You're dead!
(Deep breath)
(Deep exhale)
Agh! Bastard!
Ah! It burns!
All over now.
Die, vampire!
Help! Murder!
Just give up!
Last mistake.
Mind the way.
Such a shame.
What a waste.
What the...?!
Anybody there?
Careful there!
Do your worst!
Help, someone!
I'll bury you!
Mind yourself.
Not impressed!
Somebody help!
This ends now!
Ysmir's beard!
Yyyaaaarrgghh!
Agh! Dead body!
Easily blocked!
Filthy fetcher!
Hey! Hands off!
I can take you!
Leave me alone!
Lucky... hit...
Murder! Murder!
No sign of 'em.
Now you'll pay!
Prepare to die!
Stand... still!
You're nothing!
Azura curse you!
By the gods, no!
Die, little elf!
Don't be a fool.
Get back, thief!
I'll find you...
I'll... get you!
Nobody here now.
Oh no you don't!
The Voice? Here?
Yield or suffer!
(Heavy breathing)
Come on! Come on!
Death awaits you!
Gods... damn you!
Help me, help me!
I'll... Kill you!
Nerevar guide me!
Oh gods, my ears!
Oh, no you don't!
Oho! Not so fast!
Spare me, please!
That was amazing!
What's the hurry?
Woah... watch it!
You little thief!
You won't get me!
You've bested me!
Aaaayyyaarrrrgghh!
Agh! Flithy n'wah!
Agh! Who did this?
By Ysmir, a thief!
Die, you sonofa...
Enough... of this!
Filthy pickpocket!
Get 'em! Kill 'em!
I cannot best you!
I won't back down!
I won't hold back!
I'll fix you good!
I'll make you pay!
I'll see you burn!
It's... nothing...
Just a... scratch!
No one crosses me!
Please... mercy...
S'rendarr's mercy!
Stay away from me!
Talos protect you.
There's no escape!
Why won't you die!
You can't beat me!
You need to leave.
You puny weakling!
You win! I submit!
You're a dead man!
You're dead! Dead!
You're outmatched!
Agh! It... hurts...
Are you Dragonborn?
Can't hide from me.
Come on. Finish it!
Die, you Orc filth!
Fall to me, dragon!
Foul blood drinker!
Guards! Trespasser!
Hello? Who's there?
I'm gonna kill you!
The White take you!
This what you want?
You can't win this!
You won't get away!
You won't get away.
Ysmir... curse you!
Are you a Greybeard?
Come on, fight back!
Gods! Another fight.
How did you do that?
I knew I'd find you!
I love a good fight!
I'll have your head!
I'll skin you alive!
Just... stand still!
Leave or be removed.
No one bests an Orc!
Nobody here anymore.
None of my business.
Oh... what happened?
Please! Don't shoot!
Put up a real fight!
Take your best shot!
That voice is power!
That your best? Huh?
That's close enough.
This should be good.
Time for you to die!
What's done is done.
You can't defeat me!
You can't take that!
You're a dead woman!
You're already dead.
You're going to pay!
You're good as dead!
You're not worth it.
You've already lost!
Your end draws near!
Cleared out, I guess.
Come on, you monster!
Damn, where'd you go?
Dead? Oh my goodness!
For blood! For glory!
Graaah! I'll get you!
Help! Somebody, help!
Hey, get out of here!
I can't believe it...
I saw you steal that!
I. Will. Destroy you!
I'll rip you in half!
Kynareth preserve us.
Leave that dog alone!
Now that's just rude.
Someone do something!
Sovngarde awaits you!
This... isn't over...
Victory or Sovngarde!
Where are you hiding?
All right... End it...
Die, you filthy beast!
Going to cry now? Huh?
Hey, that isn't yours!
I can do this all day!
I'm going to find you.
Nice try, fat-fingers!
No... not like this...
Now that's a real man!
Please, don't kill me!
Think you can take me?
You dare challenge me?
You have a death wish?
You need to leave now.
Another poor soul lost.
By the gods, my ears...
Did you hear something?
Enjoy your last breath!
Hmm? What're you doing?
I know you can hear me!
I swear, I'll kill you!
I'll see you in pieces!
I've had enough of you!
Is... is someone there?
Must have been nothing.
Roggvir. You damn fool.
Shor have mercy on you!
That must be the Voice!
Time to... finish this!
To arms, boys! To arms!
Why are you doing that?
You afraid to fight me?
You're making me angry!
You're no match for me!
Are you prepared to die?
Better this one than me.
Both of you... out, out!
I'll rip your heart out!
I'll tear you to pieces!
I'm getting out of here!
I'm going to enjoy this!
It's time for you to go.
Murdered! In cold blood!
No one can save you now!
Show me what you've got!
That makes Twenty-Three.
That's the last of them.
This is the end for you!
This what you want? Huh?
Was it something I said?
You dare fight a Dunmer?
You don't have a chance!
You have a mighty voice!
You thieving little elf!
Don't do that, it's mean!
Guess it's all clear now.
Guess they deserved it...
Help! I'm being attacked!
I know I heard something.
I'll bathe in your blood!
I'll spare you - for now.
Last warning. Leave, now.
Shor's blood, the Thu'um!
Slay it! Slay the dragon!
That gave me the shivers!
That the best you can do?
That's... all you've got?
There's no need for that.
We are routed! Fall back!
Why you little filcher...
You call yourself a Nord?
You don't stand a chance!
Aghh! Just... die already!
Dead? How did this happen?
Death is highly overrated!
Did anyone else hear that?
Ha ha! I love a challenge!
I guess you can have that.
I won't go down so easily!
I'll fight you to the end!
I'll kill you, I swear it!
I'm warning you. Back off!
Let's see what you've got!
My money's on the big one.
No more! I yield! I yield!
Now that's the true Voice!
Point that somewhere else!
Poor bastard's better off.
Teach you to mess with me.
This is your last mistake!
Thought I heard something.
Was that really necessary?
What are you doing, s'wit?
What in the bloody blazes?
You must really need that.
You think you can take me?
You're a fool to fight me!
You're out of your league!
You've dug your own grave!
Agh! Enough! This ends now!
Could that be... the Voice?
Could you please leave now?
Go, you're not wanted here.
Going to enjoy killing you!
I can still put up a fight!
I suppose that's yours now.
I'll carve you into pieces!
I'll gut you like a horker!
I'll kill you if I have to!
I'll show you a real fight!
I've fought worse than you!
Just getting jumpy I guess.
Oh well. Must have run off.
True Nords never back down!
Victory is yours! I submit!
Werewolf! Kill the monster!
You dirty, filching lizard!
You must leave immediately.
You won't get away from me!
You won't leave here alive!
Your death brings me honor!
Another corpse for the pile.
Beg for your miserable life!
Give up while you still can!
Ha! I think you're bleeding!
Ha! Like the bite of a flea!
Hmm. Nothing here after all.
I suggest you aim elsewhere.
I'll gladly kill you myself!
If I can just... stand up...
Just give up! You can't win!
Look what you've made me do!
Pray to your gods for mercy!
Skyrim belongs to the Nords!
Think you can steal from me?
Those words have such power!
What sort of power was that?
You ready to die today? Huh?
You think I'm afraid of you?
You, of all people. Get out!
You'll die this day, dragon!
You'll make a fine rug, cat!
You're not welcome here. Go.
Your kind has no place here!
(Heavy breathing - sprinting)
All right, you've had enough.
Go down already, you bastard!
Hey! Watch what you're doing.
I guess you had your reasons.
I hope there aren't any more.
I know you're here somewhere.
I was sure I heard something.
I'll end your miserable life!
I'll let you live. This time.
I'll let you stay. This time.
I'll see you dead and buried!
I'll try and make this quick!
I'm going to... put you down!
Oh my word, this is terrible.
Please, someone do something!
Put that down, you mangy cat!
That sound... it's deafening!
Time to end this little game!
Ugh! That it? That your best?
When I find you, you're dead.
You brought this on yourself!
You dare dishonor the Legion?
You think you stand a chance?
You won't get away with that!
You won't get the best of me!
You won't leave Skyrim alive!
By Ysmir, you'll pay for that!
Don't worry about it. Keep it.
Hey, that's a valuable animal!
I don't think you belong here.
I'll kill you where you stand!
I've outlived worse than this!
Mind's playing tricks on me...
Never should have come here...
This is what I've trained for!
What in Arkay's name was that?
You little wretch, I saw that!
By the gods, is that the Voice?
Help! Someone's being attacked!
I'll live to drink another day!
I'll raise a cup to your grave!
I've got some fight left in me!
Not quite good enough, are you?
Pray to Stendarr while you can!
You can't hide from me forever.
You dare try and steal from me?
You need to learn some manners!
You should respect your elders!
You won't live to see tomorrow!
coughing- no subtitles displayed
I'll mount your head on my wall!
I've still got some fight in me!
Oh, what a clever thief you are.
Remind me not to make you angry.
Why are they hurting each other?
Come on, show me what you've got!
coughing - no subtitles displayed
Don't just stand there! Kill her!
Don't just stand there! Kill him!
Get your thieving hands off that!
I didn't really want that anyway.
I'll be back, and you'll be dead!
I'll have your head for a trophy!
Ooh, now that one must have hurt!
sniffling- no subtitles displayed
That's it? That's all you've got?
Weren't expecting that, were you!
You're not going to shoot, right?
You're not supposed to be here...
You're nothing, hear me? Nothing!
I guess I was just hearing things.
I'll look the other way this time.
I'm going to crush you like a bug!
short yawn- no subtitles displayed
Those fools are actually fighting!
Yield, and I may still show mercy!
I'll shatter your bones like glass!
I'm going to find whoever did this.
I'm gonna wear that tail as a belt!
I've fought colds tougher than you!
Pickpocket! We've got a pickpocket!
You won't even live to regret this!
You'll need to do better than that.
You're a disgrace to your own kind!
Agh! I been wounded worse by better!
I'll paint the snow with your blood!
The Stormcloaks pay blood for blood!
You're not getting anything from me!
By Ysmir, you won't leave here alive!
I'll show you what a real Orc can do!
Come on! Let's see you put up a fight!
I don't think there's a need for that!
It's time for you to leave, my friend.
Leave now or suffer dire consequences.
Remember... hit the one in the middle!
That sound could bring mountains down!
I may be old, but I can put up a fight!
I think it's time for you to get going.
I'm prepared to negotiate my surrender!
That's a dangerous game you're playing.
That's it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
clearing throat - no subtitles displayed
Ha! I've suffered worse during training!
That's it. I'm placing you under arrest.
And you thought I was just a pretty face.
Damn shame, Roggvir. You were a good man.
Everybody pushes me around. Well no more!
Get out of here before I call the guards!
I didn't know you were so cold-blooded...
By the gods, did that really just happen?!
I didn't think you had the stomach for it.
I'm not sticking around to fight a dragon!
Louder than the roar of the Mane, that is!
You'll beg me to kill you before I'm done!
This is the last time I'll say it. Get out.
You could have asked before just taking it.
I guess I can look the other way, this time.
I haven't heard a true shout in generations!
If you were anyone else, I'd make you leave.
You're not really allowed in here, you know.
Shouldn't leave things around to trip over...
humming softly to self- no subtitles displayed
I haven't lived this long to be beaten by you!
Fool! The Imperial Legion will have your blood!
Well... that was an unpleasant bit of business.
Can't a woman get a moment to herself? Leave me!
You're trespassing here. You'd better clear out.
You can stay, but you're not supposed to be here.
Can't a man have a bit of privacy? Get out of here!
Help yourself, by all means. Who cares if I starve?
You remind me of my cousin's cat. Killed that, too!
You should have listened. Guards! Help! Trespasser!
You should've stayed in your precious forests, elf!
You're not really supposed to... you know, be here.
This is your last warning. Get out, or get arrested.
Well well. Another maggot to squash beneath my boot.
You know you're not supposed to be in here right now.
This is the part where you fall down and bleed to death!
This is your last warning. Get away from there, or else.
You really shouldn't be in here, but I guess since it's you...
I'm not going to warn you again. Get out, or I'll call the guards!

Go!
Sure.
Now hit it again.
One, two, three...
Nice shot! Right on target.
Only use the practice arrows.
Nice job hitting those targets.
Time's up! Better luck next time.
You chose the wrong girl to mess with.
You need to stay inside the boundaries.
Listen to me and you might learn something.
Don't be like them. Don't feel sorry for me.
Well, let me know if you ever want to practice.
Excellent. Follow me to the targets and we'll begin.
Two Imperial drunks who thought they were above the law.
Stay within the boundaries and only use the practice arrows.
Let me know if you want to practice some more. Next time we'll make it a little more challenging.
Ha!
Lo!

Me.
You must kill...
And to prove my... sincerity, I have prayed for a contract. You lead this Family now. I give you the Blade of Woe, so that you can see it through.
I'm saying you were right. The Night Mother was right. The old ways... they guided the Dark Brotherhood for centuries. I was a fool to oppose them.
No!
Yeah!
Shut up.
A dragon?
Farengar!
Damn right!
Is it dead?
Wait for me.
I don't know!
Look at that!
No, Housecarl!
As you command.
Dovahkiin! No!!
Let's move out.
We're with you!
We're so dead...
Stay under cover!
The Greybeards...
Is it really dead?
Krif krin. Pruzah!
What's happening?!
Everybody get back!
Does anyone see him?
Good. Don't fail me.
Now we're in for it.
Here's the situation.
You should come, too.
Is that all you've got?
For Whiterun and Skyrim!
Have you tried to Shout?
Now you're going to pay!
We don't stand a chance!
Go ahead... try to Shout.
I can't get a bead on him!
You... must be Dragonborn!
Damned good shooting, boys!
Talos save us! It's a dragon!
I meant no disrespect, of course.
Thurri du hin sille ko Sovngarde!
We killed it! I can't believe it!
You heard right! I said a dragon!
I thought we were all dead for sure!
Take him down! It's our best chance!
Come down here and fight, you coward!
Hrongar. Don't be so hard on Avenicci.
Dragonborn? What are you talking about?
Kynareth save us, here he comes again...
That's it! We'll bring that bastard down!
That's the Greybeards' business, not ours.
But Housecarl... how can we fight a dragon?
I can't believe it! You're... Dragonborn...
Tell him what you told me. About the dragon.
A dragon is attacking the Western Watchtower.
Just send me a copy when you've deciphered it.
Follow me. We're assembling near the main gate.
What did it do? Is it attacking the watchtower?
You heard the summons. What else could it mean?
I envy you the chance to see this dragon up close!
I never heard of Tiber Septim killing any dragons.
Now what do you say? Shall we go kill us a dragon?
Don't worry, my lord. I'm the very soul of caution.
The glory of killing it is ours, if you're with me!
Zok morokei! More souls to feed my master's hunger.
Here he comes! Find cover and make every arrow count!
If they think you're Dragonborn, who are we to argue?
Let's make sure that overgrown lizard is really dead.
What do you say, Irileth? You're being awfully quiet.
You wouldn't understand, Housecarl. You ain't a Nord.
I've already ordered my men to muster near the main gate.
It's just that... what do these Greybeards want with her?
It's just that... what do these Greybeards want with him?
You went into Bleak Falls Barrow and got that? Nice work.
So, Irileth tells me you came from the western watchtower?
Good. You're finally here. The Jarl's been waiting for you.
You are brave. Balaan hokoron. Your defeat brings me honor.
Back to business, Proventus. We still have a city to defend.
A dragon! How exciting! Where was it seen? What was it doing?
I should come along. I would very much like to see this dragon.
Irileth, you'd better gather some guardsmen and get down there.
Guardsman! What happened here? Where's this dragon? Quickly now!
Didn't you hear the thundering sound as you returned to Whiterun?
We were just talking about you. My brother needs a word with you.
Brit grah. I had forgotten what fine sport you mortals can provide!
Farengar, you need to come at once. A dragon's been sighted nearby.
That was the voice of the Greybeards, summoning you to High Hrothgar!
Come on, Irileth, tell us, do you believe in this Dragonborn business?
That's right! My grandfather used to tell stories about the Dragonborn.
Those born with the Dragon Blood in 'em. Like old Tiber Septim himself.
Let's go. We need to get to the Western Watchtower before it's too late.
No matter. Go to High Hrothgar. Learn what the Greybeards can teach you.
No signs of any dragon right now, but it sure looks like he's been here.
Spread out and look for survivors. We need to know what we're dealing with.
I'll see you at the watchtower as soon as the rest of the men have gathered.
They say the Dragonborn can Shout without any training. Like Talos himself...
But remember, you're still oathbound to our cause. Skyrim still waits to be free.
That was Shouting, what you just did! Must be. You really are Dragonborn, then...
I've been all across Tamriel. I've seen plenty of things just as outlandish as this.
I'd advise you all to trust in the strength of your sword arm over tales and legends.
Hrongar, calm yourself. What does any of this Nord nonsense have to do with our friend here?
High Hrothgar is a very peaceful place. Very... disconnected from the troubles of this world.
Capable as he may be, I don't see any signs of him being this, what, [QUOTE]Dragonborn.[QUOTE]
Capable as she may be, I don't see any signs of her being this, what, [QUOTE]Dragonborn.[QUOTE]
Here's a dead dragon, and that's something I definitely understand. Now we know we can kill them.
One last thing, Irileth. This isn't a death or glory mission. I need to know what we're dealing with.
That's a fair question. None of us have ever seen a dragon before, or expected to face one in battle.
There weren't any dragons then, idiot. They're just coming back now for the first time in... forever.
I envy you, you know. To climb the 7,000 Steps again... I made the pilgrimage once, did you know that?
But the old tales tell of the Dragonborn who could kill dragons and steal their power. You must be one!
I wonder that the Greybeards even notice what's going on down here. They haven't seemed to care before.
But I don't need some mythical Dragonborn. Someone who can put down a dragon is more than enough for me.
Uh... that's right. We saw it coming from the south. It was fast... faster than anything I've ever seen.
But we are honorbound to fight it, even if we fail. This dragon is threatening our homes... our families.
So your information was correct after all. And we have our friend here to thank for recovering it for us.
Whatever happened when you killed that dragon, it revealed something in you, and the Greybeards heard it.
Could you call yourselves Nords if you ran from this monster? Are you going to let me face this thing alone?
Good work, son. We'll take it from here. Head down to the barracks for some food and rest. You've earned it.
But it's more than our honor at stake here. Think of it - the first dragon seen in Skyrim since the last age.
No! Get back! It's still here somewhere! Hroki and Tor just got grabbed when they tried to make a run for it!
If you really are Dragonborn, like out of the old tales, you ought to be able to Shout. Can you? Have you tried?
No. I can't afford to risk both of you. I need you here working on ways to defend the city against these dragons.
Hmph. Some of you would be better off keeping quiet than flapping your gums on matters you don't know anything about.
I know it looks bad, but we've got to figure out what happened. And if that dragon is still skulking around somewhere.
I don't much care where it came from or who sent it. What I do know is that it's made the mistake of attacking Whiterun!
I'd take this a bit more seriously if I were you. If a dragon decides to attack Whiterun I don't know if we can stop it.
There's no refusing a summons from the Greybeards. If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your power.
You'd better get up to High Hrothgar immediately. There's no refusing the summons of the Greybeards. It's a tremendous honor.
Nord nonsense?! Why you puffed-up ignorant... these are our sacred traditions that go back to the founding of the First Empire!
This hasn't happened in ... centuries, at least. Not since Tiber Septim himself was summoned when he was still Talos of Atmora!
No, my lord. It was just circling overhead when I left. I never ran so fast in my life... I thought it would come after me for sure.
No?
It is good that you were willing to help J'zargo. This will not be forgotten, friend.
It is true, J'zargo suspected there might be problems. But this is most disappointing.
No.
Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room after he got it.
For that amount, I can. Fine. I did notice something odd last time we handed out the pay.
Oh?
Hush now. Think no more of it.
I had a bad dream again last night.
It was scary. It was like it was real!
It's just a dream, child. Nothing more.
I dreamt that you went away. You made monsters.
Oh.
Why?
Yes sir, I have.
Have you been working on your concentration?
Good. Concentration is paramount when dealing with magical forces.
Have no fear. I believe it is within you to excel in your studies. But you must learn to concentrate!
Because an unfocused mind will almost certainly be obliterated. Destroyed by the forces you attempt to control and yield.
So?
Wait!
Great.
Drennen!
Aaaaaaaaaaa....
Waiting for what?
This place is huge.
Anavchnzel is waiting.
Not to mention our pay.
Please take the Lexicon.
Why? Why do you pursue me?
This place is unbelievable.
Something doesn't feel right.
So we grab it and we get out, right?
So we're not turning back, you fool.
Please don't leave. You must help me.
I have the Lexicon! Where's the podium?
I told you we should have hired a thief.
My pay will be nothing if we die in here!
The way out is right there! Run, damn it!
And yet none of us can pick a damned lock.
You sure that's power we're meant to have?
I can't hold these things! We need to leave!
Best get rid of the ones we see. Just in case.
It's yours now. I won't take it back. I won't.
Ours. Soon the Lexicon's knowledge will be ours.
I can't do this. We shouldn't be here. I'm sorry.
Let the field mouse run. Your pay will be double.
The Lexicon had better be worth all this trouble.
Why are all these metal... things... ignoring us?
We are thieves, you fool. We're stealing the cube.
It is done. I won't go back to Avanchnzel. I won't.
Maybe we should turn back. I don't want to sleep here.
We are close now. Can you hear the Lexicon calling out?
Avanchnzel. Take it to Avanchnzel. You must take it back.
If you two cannot handle this, we can find others to hire.
I thought you said these things were [QUOTE]sleeping[QUOTE]?
A few hours sleep and we should be ready to continue through.
We're almost there. I can hear the Lexicon. Come on. Quickly!
I did not come all the way here just to walk out empty-handed.
I don't like this place. It feels like we're being... watched.
Enough. Their services will be more than adequate. Let us continue.
Properly controlled, it has knowledge enough to turn paupers into kings.
Besides, you're not scared of a few sleeping metal men. Are you, Drennen?
I could have left it behind. I could have put it back where it came from.
No one seems to know. Perhaps the return of the Dwemer. Perhaps the end of the world.
It's a simple job, Drennen. We get in, we steal the Lexicon, we leave. Don't get jumpy.
I assure you, it is. The knowledge contained in the Lexicon created everything you see around you.
Indeed. Avanchnzel is as much a library as it is a city. Built to hold the vast memories of the Dwemer.
It is large, indeed. I did not anticipate Avanchnzel's size or the time needed to uncover the entrance.
Calm yourself, Breya. We are closing in on the Lexicon. I can feel it calling. We'll continue without Drennen.
Drennen, you do understand that the Lexicon at the bottom of this place holds the accumulated memories of centuries of Dwemer.
Once we have the Lexicon, we'll need to take it to its podium. I know what to do from there. Soon the Lexicon's knowledge will be mine.
You said they were sleeping. I said they were waiting. It seems a few of them were [QUOTE]waiting[QUOTE] for someone to try and take the Lexicon.
Uf!
Egh!
Yergh!
Agh!
Gah!
Nnh!
Oof!
Unf!
Yah!
Hunh!
Agh...
Gah...
Nargh!
Rargh!
Ugh...
Yeagh!
Aggh...
Hyargh!
Grrragh!
Rrarggh!
Yearrgh!
Quiet again.
Nnyyyaarrgghh!
Fall before me!
No one escapes!
Now you suffer!
You will bleed!
Hhyyaarargghhhh!
No match at all.
Nothing after all.
Oblivion take you!
I smell weakness...
Rrrraaaaarrggghhhh!
You are weak, mortal.
You cannot escape me!
A challenger is near...
Another who seeks death.
No... not by a mortal...
There you are, weakling!
You meet your end, mortal.
I will feast on your heart.
You return, foolish mortal?
There could be no other end.
Hiding will not save you now.
It cannot... end like this...
Are you prepared for your death?
I honor my lord by destroying you!
Aha.
Ah ha.
Uh-oh.
Careful!
Damn it.
Bad move.
Dammit...
Damn you.
On guard!
Too slow.
Dovahkiin.
silent bow
Dragonborn.
Lok, Thu'um.
Nothing yet.
There he is!
Who's there?
Goodbye then.
grunt of pain
I've got one!
For Sovngarde!
Where'd you go?
Now you're mine!
That's all, hmm?
Better make sure.
Breath and focus.
Here we go again.
Su'um ahrk morah.
That's strange...
This is not good.
Did you hear that?
Watch out. Wolves.
Ach, there you are.
For the Dragonborn!
Maybe they're gone?
Anyone see anything?
Lead me into battle.
I think they're gone.
I'm too old for this.
Speak. I will listen.
That's how it's done.
This won't take long.
Do you need something?
I'm not afraid of you.
This is how it's done.
Did you need something?
Hold on, what was that?
I serve the Dragonborn.
Nothing there. Strange.
Running won't save you.
Drem Yol Lok. Greetings.
Feel the bite of my axe!
Go away! Leave me alone!
I could use a hand here.
I must be getting jumpy.
That takes care of that.
I don't see 'em any more.
Let's get this over with.
Well, good. They're gone.
You should have run away.
Don't let your guard down.
Eh? Did you say something?
Hmm. I don't see anything.
I vowed to have your head.
I'm afraid I've lost them.
My debt is repaid at last.
Another one for the Blades.
But, there's one they fear.
Got to be here somewhere...
Hmm. Gone. I don't like it.
I'm going to check that out.
Remember Cloud Ruler Temple!
So it wasn't my imagination.
That's the end of that, hmm?
Esbern cannot elude us, fool.
Feel the thunder of my voice!
Good. I can use the practice.
Hmm, nothing there after all.
I was just getting warmed up.
I wasn't looking for trouble.
I'm getting too old for this.
I'm in a bit of trouble here.
I'm sure I heard something...
That seems to be all of them.
The Thalmor's memory is long.
What do you need, Dragonborn?
I can always use the practice.
If that's the way you want it.
Oho, so that's where you went.
What is your need, Dragonborn?
A shame it had to come to that.
I need some help with this one!
No escape this time, foul worm!
Where do they keep coming from?
I could use some help over here!
I think this might be the end...
Must still be here, somewhere...
Their defeat was merely a delay.
You are not worthy of Sovngarde!
You think running will save you?
You've brought this on yourself.
In their tongue, he is Dovahkiin.
Not bad... but it won't save you.
You're not afraid of me, are you?
You're starting to make me angry.
Come on. What are you waiting for?
Hmm. I was sure I heard something.
I shall sing of thee in Sovngarde!
My sword will taste of your blood!
Now it's your turn, Thalmor bitch.
To the time after Oblivion opened.
Alduin cannot ignore this for long.
You'll have to do better than that.
I answer the call of the Dragonborn.
I've waited an eternity for this day.
Must be my mind playing tricks on me.
You can still run. It's not too late.
The roads just aren't safe these days.
Ah... so tender. Come here, you morsel!
Seems I still remember my old training.
Stand together and we shall defeat him!
Stay alert. They may not have gone far.
Thalmor dog! Death is too good for you.
The Elder Scrolls told of their return.
The dragons will surely fear your Voice.
Your training proceeds well, Dragonborn.
You should run while you have the chance.
Could have been my imagination, I suppose...
Did you think the Blades had been destroyed?
You should have acted. They're already here.
I gave up this kind of thing a long time ago.
You will die for the glory of the Dragonborn!
It is glorious to battle once again in Tamriel!
Lorkhan's eyes, you're an ugly one, aren't you?
The Blades will never be defeated, Thalmor dog.
Should have picked somebody else for your dinner.
And when the truth finally dawns, it dawns in fire.
When the sons of Skyrim would spill their own blood.
You should not have meddled in the Thalmor's affairs.
But no one wanted to believe. Believe they even existed.
You'll have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in my right ear.
Be careful. The Forsworn are just as dangerous as they look.
You'll die knowing it was the Blades that sent you to Oblivion.
It was always just before dawn. The whole world was in darkness.
Ah! I've heard of this Shouting, but never seen it. Fascinating...
In the manner of dreams, I cannot escape. I'm forced to wait and watch.
I've read the dragon language, but to hear it spoken is most interesting.
Keep an eye out for wolves if you're headed up the path to High Hrothgar.
I want to leave my high place, to seek shelter. From what, I don't yet know.
And then I would wake up. And hope that it was just a dream... but know that it was not.
This skill should prove very useful, Dragonborn. Fighting fire with fire, as the saying goes.
I used to dream of it. In the dream, I was standing... someplace high up... a tower, or mountain.
So you made it out. Good for you. Don't expect me to thank you. I still remember what you did to me.
Ah... the power of the dragon is yours! There can be no doubt that you are the Dragonborn of prophecy.
But now it's too late for escape. The dragon is upon me - fire and darkness descending like a thunderbolt.
Then came the flash of light - just on the horizon, within the clouds that mark the border between worlds.
Ah! You made it! Good to see you, my friend. I'll never forget how you saved my life from those Thalmor maniacs.
This is High Hrothgar, our temple, sanctuary, and home. We ask that you respect our solitude while you are here.
And not just any dragon, but the Dragon - Alduin, the World-Eater, the dragon who devours both the living and the dead.
It could have been lightning, but there was no thunder. In the dream, the sense of foreboding grew, but I could never wake up.
Then, finally, realization and horror arrive together. The orange is flame, heat. The sound a roar, a challenge in their ancient tongue.
And a sound, too. Distinct and indistinct. Not thunder... something else. Something I should recognize, but in the dream I cannot place it.
Then it came again, this time more distinct. Closer. Definitely not lightning now. It was orange - brilliant orange, the color of hearth and dawn.
And?
But only if you use the axe to kill Barbas. Simple as that.
Oh, sure, he'll be back in a century or two, but think of the fun I can have 'til then.
Absolutely! Now I can reabsorb his body, and return to full power. All without having to listen to his whining.
Enjoy that axe! And don't worry about poor old Barbas. After all, he really should have picked a better friend...
Excellent work. A hero and his faithful companion, retrieving the ancient artifact for the prince. It's almost... storybook.
Ah, but it almost seems a shame to give a weapon like that away, doesn't it? I suppose I could be persuaded to let you keep it...
Aye!
Raagh!
Balgruuf!
Not so fast Elf!
Stay back, lord!
This isn't over.
Where's Anuriel?
The city is yours.
Enough! Both of you!
Are you two quite done?
Pack your things and go.
It's over! Everyone stop!
Stop! Enough! Stand down!
You, go pack your things.
I said, on your knees, Elf!
You think this is personal?
Ahhh... It's good to be home.
Halt in the name of the Jarl!
I surrender... I surrender...
And this... This is all wrong.
I think I'll like living here.
I presume you're talking to me?
No, Igmund. It's too dangerous.
Come Galmar, we have much to do.
Come, Legate. There's much to do.
Protect the Jarl with your lives!
The Empire will return. Count on it.
Halt in the name of the Jarl Hrongar.
Stop right there! Were I can see you.
A bit melodramatic, even for you Laila.
Indeed. Come, there is much to be done.
Tell me, Vignar. Was all this worth it?
Yes, but not likely the one you intend.
Somehow I doubt that will persuade them.
You hear me you old fool! This isn't over!
It's a little late for that, don't you think?
Kill them all. Protect the Jarl at all costs!
Oh? I don't expect anyone to miss my meaning.
He's right. Galmar, come, let us restore order.
She's watching over the others. Look alive now.
Someone get that thing out of here and burn it.
We must move quickly to prevent further violence.
Enough! That's enough. I surrender... I surrender.
Halt in the name of the Jarl Balgruuf the Greater!
He wants the city this badly, he can fight me for it.
Enjoy this while you can. Soon you will all be slaves.
Ready to listen to the Silver-Blood family now, Igmund?
She wants the city this badly, she can fight me for it.
Peace! Everyone stand down. That's an order. Stand down!
There is a burning city out there that needs a government.
Yield. I yield, Stormcloak! The city of Markarth is yours.
Jarl Black-Briar. I must admit, I do like the sound of that.
Welcome back. I've left a few surprises for you to discover.
If you ladies are finished bickering, there's much to be done.
You never were able to see the forest for the trees, were you?
And you, go sit on that damn chair and start acting like a Jarl.
Don't worry. We'll take good care of your city when you're gone.
And don't worry about any rioting, Legate. I have it under control.
How kind of you. And I've brought an army to give you a going away parade.
I will not surrender Markarth without raising my own sword in her defense.
If they want my city, they're going to have to take it from me personally.
You could see that if you had any faith left in that black heart of yours.
I'll be damned if I let this rabble take my city without raising my own sword.
Thongvor. I should have executed your whole treacherous clan when I had the chance.
And you. A Stormcloak? I'd thought better of you. You'll all come to regret this day.
If you two are finished with the touching homecoming, there's a city in chaos out there.
One day when you can see past your own interests, you will come to see that we were right.
Skyrim needs a High King who will fight for her, and Whiterun needs a Jarl who will do the same.
Jarl Black-Briar put your government together. Do it now, or there will be rioting in the streets.
The Empire has no place in Skyrim... not any more. And you? You have no place in Whiterun anymore.
We will soon begin publicly executing captured men. That should send a clear message to the people.
How many of those corpses lining our streets wear the faces of men who once called you friend? What about their families?
We Nords were proud warriors once. And we still could be. Evidenced by the men and women who fought and died bravely today.
When Ulfric Stormcloak becomes High King, Skyrim will finally be the way my ancestors intended. It's a new day in Markarth.
We should be fighting those witch-elves, not bending knee to them. The Emperor is nothing more than a puppet of the Thalmor.
Vignar Gray-Mane! Your family was noticeably absent from the walls. Now I know why. Wouldn't a dagger in the back have sufficed?
So enters Maven Black-Briar, the glint of Imperial coin in her eyes. So tell me, what's the price for a woman's integrity these days?
But no, you're content to snatch scraps falling off the Emperor's table. Fine. Take my home. Take my city. May it burn down around you.
If this was my Empire, I'd be able to worship whoever I damned well pleased. You wish to see an Empire without Talos? Without its soul?
A convenient position to hold now. But mark my words, old man, in the days to come, Ulfric will spread his rebellion thin. And what then?
Riften denies the Emperor. You are here illegally. Stand down and you will be arrested and tried in the morning. Resist and you will die.
We need the Empire, as much as it needs us. We Nords are the Empire! Our blood built it. Our blood sustains it! You of all people should know that.
Aye.
My loss, right?
I suppose it is.
I'll do my best.
Then I don't have time for you.
Be glad you're not training under me with that mouth of yours.
Bex!
Ro...
Dah...
Nah...
Kest...
Wuld...
Master Borri.
Well done. Again.
Now it is your turn.
Master Borri is waiting.
That's it. One more time.
Master Einarth is waiting.
Use both words, if you can.
You learn quickly. Once more.
Try it again. Breath and focus.
Is this your best effort? Again.
You are now ready for your last trial.
Strike us with the power of your Voice.
You must feel the Word within yourself.
Come, Dragonborn. Attend to Master Borri.
Shout at us, and let us taste of your Voice.
You learn quickly, as only a Dragonborn can.
Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok.
Do not be afraid. Your Shout will not harm us.
Come, we will do your next test inside the hall.
Dragonborn. It is you. Welcome to High Hrothgar.
Now let us see if you are willing and able to learn.
Strike the targets as they appear. Breath and focus.
We will now see how you learn a completely new Shout.
Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Word.
Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Shout.
Remain true to the Way of the Voice, and you will return.
Now let us see how quickly you can master your new Thu'um.
Don't worry, though. You will find all three Words in Ustengrav.
Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau.
You learn a new word like a master... you truly do have the gift.
You have completed your training, Dragonborn. We would Speak to you.
So... a Dragonborn appears, at this moment in the turning of the age.
I see that you have already begun to learn the Whirlwind Sprint Shout.
Use both Fus and Ro. Together, they will make the Shout more powerful.
Use your Unrelenting Force shout to strike the targets as they appear.
We will perform your next trial in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.
You show promise. Remain focused, and you will fulfill your potential.
Impressive. Your Thu'um is precise. You show great promise, Dragonborn.
Master Wulfgar will now gift you with his knowledge of [QUOTE]Dah.[QUOTE]
Master Wulfgar will demonstrate Whirlwind Sprint. Then it will be your turn.
Approach Master Borri and he will gift you his knowledge of [QUOTE]Nah.[QUOTE]
Approach Master Borri and he will gift you his knowledge of [QUOTE]Kest.[QUOTE]
Approach Master Borri and he will gift you his knowledge of [QUOTE]Wuld.[QUOTE]
With all three words together, this Shout is much more powerful. Use it wisely.
You must hear the Word within yourself before you can project it into a Thu'um.
Master Borri has agreed to teach you the first Word of a new Shout. Attend to him.
Master Borri will teach you [QUOTE]Wuld,[QUOTE] which means [QUOTE]Whirlwind.[QUOTE]
Masters Einarth, Borri, and Wulfgar will each demonstrate a Shout. Make your choice.
Master Einarth will now teach you [QUOTE]Ro,[QUOTE] the second Word in Unrelenting Force.
You have the ability, but you need to learn discpline if you wish to fulfill your potential.
Retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, our founder, from his tomb in the ancient fane of Ustengrav.
Master Borri will teach you [QUOTE]Nah[QUOTE] - [QUOTE]Fury[QUOTE] - the second word of Whirlwind Sprint.
Master Borri will teach you [QUOTE]Kest[QUOTE] - [QUOTE]Tempest[QUOTE]- the third word of Whirlwind Sprint.
As part of your initiation, Master Einarth will allow you to tap into his understanding of [QUOTE]Ro.[QUOTE]
Stand next to me. Master Borri will open the gate. Use your Whirlwind Sprint to pass through before it closes.
Without training, you have already taken the first steps towards projecting your Voice into a Thu'um, a Shout.
You are ready to learn the final word of Unrelenting Force, [QUOTE]Dah,[QUOTE] which means [QUOTE]Push.[QUOTE]
Dovahkiin. You have tasted the Voice of the Greybeards, and passed through unscathed. High Hrothgar is open to you.
Stand between us, and prepare yourself. Few can withstand the unbridled Voice of the Greybeards. But you are ready.
Naal Thu'umu, mu ofan nii nu, Dovahkiin, naal suleyk do Kaan, naal suleyk do Shor, ahrk naal suleyk do Atmorasewuth.
All Shouts are made up of three Words of Power. As you master each Word, your Shout will become progressively stronger.
Well, that is how the rest of us learn Shouts. As Dragonborn, you can absorb a slain dragon's life force and knowledge directly.
When you Shout, you speak in the language of dragons. Thus, your Dragon Blood gives you an inborn ability to learn Words of Power.
Ro means [QUOTE]Balance[QUOTE] in the dragon tongue. Combine it with Fus - [QUOTE]Force[QUOTE] - to focus your Thu'um more sharply.
But learning a Word of Power is only the first step... you must unlock its meaning through constant practice in order to use it in a Shout.
Bye!
Okay, great!
Now I'm finally going to have some fun around here.
Bye.
Goodbye.
Bye, now.
Yeah, yeah.
Bye now, miss.
What? Oh. Bye.
Bye now, dearie.
Bye now, mister.
Get going, then.
Outsiders. Pfft.
Need a new blade?
Oh, goodbye then.
Arkay protect you.
I have work to do.
Take care, dearie.
What? Oh, goodbye.
Got metal to shape.
Just here to drink.
Bother someone else.
I have herbs to mix.
Safe travels to you.
Taxes. I love taxes.
Good fighting to you.
How about some armor?
Busy with the smelter.
I have silver to bend.
Back to making weapons.
I have a prison to run.
I have letters to read.
Out of my way, kinsman.
Arkay's blessing to you.
Don't cause any trouble.
Out of my way, outsider.
Back to my studies, then.
Bring more gold next time.
Dibella's blessing to you.
I'm just here to clean up.
Nothing, you pig-headed oaf!
Need to get back to chopping.
Stay out of trouble in my city.
Live a life worth telling about.
The blood of Markarth is silver.
The bloodiest beef in the Reach.
Warrens ain't for you. Trust me.
I have records I need to tend to.
Can't you see I'm working? Beat it.
Don't bother with Tacitus. Useless.
I have things to study, what is it?
If you need anything else, just ask.
May the crags fail to trip your feet.
No breaks for a good worker out here.
Come back whenever you need something.
I run the forge now. Kind of... scary.
Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.
The finest jewelry in all of Markarth.
The Silver-Blood family will be heard.
What can an old skald do for you, huh?
Be careful not to fall on your way out.
I think I'm going to get another drink.
Worship of Talos is strictly forbidden.
Yes, I was bored talking to you anyway.
I should get back to memorizing recipes.
Not scared of an old woman now, are you?
Stop by my stall in the market sometime.
Let me know if you need something forged.
Yes, yes. I have a lot of research to do.
Don't try to haggle with me. Buy or leave.
Feel free to take a look around the store.
I'm just a servant. Don't pay me any mind.
If you'll excuse me, I have a city to run.
Blood and silver, friend. Blood and silver.
Didn't I speak clear enough? Out of my way.
I better get back to sorting the dry goods.
I'm Igmund's uncle as well as his steward.
Now you just tell me if you need something.
You don't want to be here. No one wants to.
Come back if you need a new ring or necklace.
My mother and father yell a lot. Always have.
Now where did I put that shipment of forks...
Now, is lavender an herb or a poison? Hmm....
The Dominion is here, and we're watching you.
With Lisbet gone, I'll be taking care of you.
A war dog is good company and good protection.
Come back when you need more meat. Bring gold.
I have to work, or Anton will rip my head off.
I should remind Kleppr to clean this place up.
What was that you said, venomous wife of mine?
Why can't the men in this city leave me alone?
Goodbye. Be careful if you head into the ruins.
Got an axe here. Good for cleaving up Forsworn.
Tell everyone you see to bring me some septims.
Drinks here are watered down, but they're cheap.
Hey you. Yeah, you. Fresh meat for your stomach.
Oh yes... you'll need one of my special brews...
Remember. Ale is cheaper than blood in Markarth.
Let me know if there's something you need to buy.
Stay clear of the Forsworn. Bloodthirsty savages.
Can't talk. Mulush will beat me if I stop working.
I'm Ghorza's assistant. I help her with the forge.
I'm keeping Arnleif and Sons going, as best I can.
These workers. Always complaining. Always excuses.
They don't like us talking to people when we work.
If a man has time to complain, he has time to work.
My wife Kerah runs our jewelry stall in the market.
My worthless husband is gone, so I run the inn now.
Unlike my husband Kleppr, I watch after our guests.
The Thalmor know how to deal with Talos worshippers.
Before you say anything, no, I am not from the Reach.
I like the loyalty of a dog. Not as fickle as a wolf.
The Hag's Cure is here for all your discreet needs...
Don't know anyone here doesn't have Rattles or Ataxia.
Ghorza is the one you should ask if you need anything.
I don't think we have anything to discuss, Stormcloak.
I should get back to work. Money doesn't count itself.
I've taken over the Hag's Cure, since Bothela is gone.
Ondolemar is the commander of the Thalmor in Markarth.
Time to prepare some more records on the silver trade.
Treat my people fairly, and I will do the same to you.
You want a cut of venison or mutton? Of course you do.
City of Markarth sure is a beauty. No doubt about that.
Even the dead need company. That's what Arkay provides.
It's been a hard day cleaning. Good, honest work I say.
Maybe you could buy a gift for a friend? A best friend?
Things are so much quieter with my darling Frabbi dead.
You speak to Igmund. Son of Hrolfdir. Jarl of Markarth.
As his housecarl, Igmund's security is my chief concern.
I'm Calcelmo's nephew. I help him around the laboratory.
If someone joins the Forsworn, we haul him to the mines.
Igmund is alive, and I'll keep it that way, Jarl or not.
Jewelry for sale. Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.
Making weapons and armor isn't like making nails at all.
Silver-Bloods tax everything now that they run the city.
The Jarl gives me two incompetent assistants. Worthless.
The secret to chopping meat is never washing your hands.
I love hearing Ogmund sing at the inn. He's a true skald.
I work silver, like my father, and his father before him.
Lisbet handles the customers. I just check the shipments.
Need a trained war dog? Fiercest companion money can buy.
I should heat up the forge. Why does it have to be so hot?
I've worked in the Treasury House for almost twenty years.
Keep your eyes open for Forsworn when you're on the roads.
Let's see those Stormcloaks try to break into this canyon.
The Warrens isn't a place for your type. What do you want?
Thongvor may be the head of the family, but I'm the hands.
You lay one finger on Igmund, and I'll end you Stormcloak.
You need a sword? Uh, how about a small sword? Nail-sized?
Did you need something? A staff? Some enchanting materials?
I brought in my cousin Cosnach to help me handle shipments.
Just turn around and leave the city. That's the smart move.
Never thought I'd be running the store. I'm not used to it.
Now you let me know if you need a cure... or anything else.
I'm afraid to touch half of the things we keep in the tower.
I'm Thongvor's steward now. Every coin in this city is ours.
There's no shipments coming in, so I do nothing. Just drink.
You need a reliable horse in the Reach. That's what we have.
You treat a horse well, it'll take you to Oblivion and back.
I've been at Arnleif and Sons all my life. It's a good store.
My daughter Adara is also my apprentice. She's a quick study.
Outsiders aren't trusted in Markarth. Best keep that in mind.
What do you want? Haven't you done enough damage to Markarth?
A little bit of old Reach magic can cure whatever ills you....
I have meals to cook for the entire castle and almost no help.
Oh, excuse me. With my uncle gone, things are a bit of a mess.
Traveling in the Reach is dangerous. You need a good carriage.
Working in the Treasury House isn't so bad. I earn good money.
Can't believe I'm posted here. Even the beds are made of stone.
No, I'm not Arnleif. Yes, I know it's called Arnleif and Sons.
Only reason Jarl keeps Anton on is because he cooks up a storm.
Songs are just old memories that help the mead go down quicker.
There isn't an inch of this building that I haven't cleaned up.
Are you looking for a gift for a friend, perhaps? Or... a lover?
Being an apprentice is great. I get to swing a hammer at things.
Break the law in Markarth, and it's off to Cidhna Mine with you.
Guards are free to search your room. Uh, just keep that in mind.
I spill just a bit of metal, and Mulush takes it out of my hide.
I tell Thonar I can only smelt what Nepos and his miners dig up.
I'll be handling the horses with Cedran gone. Miss that old man.
Keeping this place secure is as simple as breaking a few spines.
You come right to me if you find an unwashed floor or lumpy bed.
You just let old nana know if you need anything, all right dear?
You there, uh, the finest silver in Markarth is sold right here.
You'd think an apprentice could forge a few hinges. Not Tacitus.
I have potions for disease, love sickness, irritating children...
I remember old Arnleif building each shelf in this store himself.
I'm going to be a silversmith one day, like my mother and father.
My father Kleppr is the one you want to talk to. I just clean up.
Poor Banning. Twice as much work here in the stables without him.
The Empire didn't think we could take the Reach, but here we are.
You'll want some thick armor if you're traveling the Reach alone.
Don't mind the yelling. My parents are always going at each other.
Every prisoner in the Reach is just another worker for our family.
I'm not sure if half these potions work. But they should. I think.
I'm not very good for anything more than smithing nails right now.
Anton sure looks like he's from the Reach, but don't tell him that.
Don't mind the dogs, they get anxious when they haven't had dinner.
I wish Bothela was still running the store. I'm not ready for this.
Igmund was weak. We'll bring the order that the Empire should have.
Jarl can refuse to see me all he likes. He can't ignore us forever.
Markarth is a city of wealth, but gold doesn't follow you in death.
Shipment of silver this month is behind. Nepos is to blame, not me.
This war is such nonsense. All this fuss over their false human god.
Thongvor's made me his housecarl. Remember, me killing you is legal.
Used to have run-ins with the guards, now they have run-ins with me.
You should talk to Anton if you need anything. He's the master chef.
My daughter Adara is going to be a fine silversmith when she's older.
One time, I almost cut a finger off sharpening a blade. I hate blood.
The Forsworn know every stone in the Reach. We have to wait them out.
You have the honor of addressing a member of the Thalmor. Bask in it.
Don't let my uncle go on about his theories. You'll be here all night.
I'll bend Kleppr's ear if there's anything wrong with a room you rent.
Ildene has been working in the Treasury House since before I was born.
Isn't my son Hreinn such a good worker? Not like his father at all....
Sometimes I hear Yngvar singing in his room. He's actually quite good.
The Aldmeri Dominion is the only thing keeping the Empire on its feet.
There's a small skeever den just east of the city, at Reachwater Rock.
Very well, you may approach the Mournful Throne, but watch your words.
So the Stormcloaks took the Reach? Maybe Talos really is on their side.
The artifacts I've discovered in Nchuand-Zel will make history one day.
The Forsworn have been spotted to the north, near Bruca's Leap Redoubt.
We all come into Arkay's light in the end, but there's no need to rush.
Come on, you outsiders always have plenty of gold on you. Spare a piece!
Markarth lives because my family makes sure it's fed on gold and silver.
There's so much to learn about the shop. I'll never get it all straight.
I prefer working in silver. More skill needed than forging iron or steel.
I try not to think about how my uncle got all the Dwemer Centurion parts.
Forsworn have troubled the Reach for too long. I intend to deal with them.
How about a septim? Wait, make that two septims, I feel like living it up.
The selection seems small, but we can provide whatever you need. Just ask.
A man like me makes a lot of enemies. People are always trying to cheat me.
Let the Forsworn ravage the Reach. Talos favors us. Our victory is assured.
My husband Thonar handles all our family's business. He's an important man.
Stormcloaks took Markarth. It is good to see Talos worshipped openly again.
We control every piece of this city. The people should be calling us kings.
I have a necklace that would look lovely on you, or on a... special someone.
I oversee Markarth Smelter. Worker gets out of line, I get him back in line.
I advise Igmund the same way I advised his father. Caution, caution, caution.
If I can't get you something, I'm sure my wife will bellow at me until I can.
Caught a case of Rockjoint, once. Bothela at the Hag's Cure fixed me right up.
I learned to forge when I was a pup, then I joined the Legion and mastered it.
I married Thonar for the money, and I'm not the least bit ashamed to admit it.
Let me guess - you need a drink. It's the Silver-Blood Inn you're looking for.
My father is more generous than he lets on. Gives me plenty of spending money.
This is the Silver-Blood Inn. I'll let you figure out who owns it by yourself.
We'll be sending generous resources to Ulfric. As much as the Reach can bleed.
I've only ever lost a few guards to Steam Centurions. Good odds, considering...
Markarth is not without its problems, but the Empire is here to maintain order.
You have to train a good war dog from a pup. Bite your arm clean off otherwise.
Stormcloaks have taken the Reach, but we'll return. The Empire will bring order.
I'm not half the wizard my uncle was, but I still have a few spells worth buying.
I've seen every corner of Skyrim, but nothing is as beautiful as the battlefield.
If you see any signs of Talos worship, it's your obligation to report them to me.
Arnleif and Sons Trading Company buys and sells anything you wandering types need.
I can't believe we lost Markarth. Igmund's family has ruled there for generations.
I'm married to Thonar Silver-Blood. Keep that in mind while you're speaking to me.
Perhaps a silver necklace or a silver ring? Easy to wear and soft against the skin.
I can't believe the mess Kleppr left things in. I have twice the work with him gone.
I used to travel so much before all this Forsworn nonsense. Such an inconvenience...
I'm a busy man. Half this city works for my family, and I have to keep them in line.
Mama doesn't like me jumping up and down in the house, but I can't help it. I swear.
Old Arnleif would be proud of Lisbet. She's kept this place running, thick and thin.
Alms. I said [QUOTE]alms[QUOTE] you backbiter. Give a crippled worker a helping hand.
You should see that Orc over in Understone Keep, have him forge you some new armor...
I served in the Legion with Thongvor Silver-Blood. He's a good man and a tough soldier.
Igmund's father was killed by Forsworn. I won't rest until they've paid with their blood.
I'm Bothela's assistant. She's the one you should talk to if you need an herb or a potion.
The Empire has always been good to the Orcs, but this war of theirs is none of my concern.
[QUOTE]Check the shipments[QUOTE] Lisbet says. [QUOTE]There are no shipments[QUOTE] I says.
My family owns this inn, but I've put Kleppr in charge. Right rat for the right job, I say.
Raerek is far too cautious, but I'll agree with him on any measure that keeps this city safe.
I paid extra for the biggest room in the Silver-Blood Inn. I need space to stretch these arms.
Travel southeast and you'll find an Orc stronghold, up around the old Dushnikh orichalcum mine.
I am the Jarl of Markarth, now. The Silver-Blood family is finally where it should have always been.
Stormcloaks or Imperials. Either way, all they want is everything for free and you to lick their boots.
I'm the Jarl's personal blacksmith, but that doesn't mean I can't sell you a few pieces for a fair price.
By Shor, you're hauling around a lot of junk. Best stop in at the Arnleif and Sons Trading Company, sell it off.
Lots of nasty holes in the Reach, and Blind Cliff Cave is one of them. A filthy Hagraven nest, northeast of here.
Beware the region northeast, across the river. Forsworn have taken refuge in Broken Tower Redoubt and Red Eagle Redoubt.
There's an evil to the north, friend, and its name is Ragnvald. A tomb like so many in Skyrim, where the dead have found no peace.
Die!
Nuhn!
Wagh!
Aghh..
Unnff!
Yiiee!
Hrargh!
Rrargh!
Give up?
Damn you!
Grrarrgh!
Hahahaha!
No mercy!
Noooo....
Pathetic.
Take that!
Die damnit!
Dodge this!
Bring it on!
Die villain!
Die, insect!
Yeeeaarrggh!
You're mine!
Die Imperial!
Hhyyaarrgghh!
That was fun.
Die, damn you!
Ha, found you!
On your knees!
Out of my way!
Show yourself!
So, it begins.
There you are!
Time to fight!
Waste of time.
Where are you?
Die, will you?!
Enough of this!
Fall, damn you!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
I will end you!
Nnnnyyaarrgghh!
You're... dead!
No one here now.
You're pathetic!
Damn it, no more!
Ready to give up?
Sovngarde awaits!
You mean nothing!
Getting tired yet?
How disappointing.
I heard something.
I'll... get you...
I'm getting bored.
I'm not impressed.
Shadows take me...
You cannot escape!
Your life is mine!
Gods... the pain...
I'm not done yet...
So ends the lesson.
This should be fun!
Come on! I dare you!
Don't make me laugh!
Ha! You're pathetic!
I'll tear you apart!
My power is supreme!
Shadows consume you.
Your fate is sealed!
Darkness consume you!
I cannot be defeated!
I'll cut your throat!
I'll give no quarter!
Your life is forfeit!
Come on, I won't bite.
I can smell your fear.
I hardly felt a thing.
No mercy for the weak!
Where'd you come from?
You call this a fight?
Come on, show yourself!
Hm? Something's near...
I... Willl... kill you!
I'll enjoy killing you!
Must've scared 'em off.
That's the end of that.
You can't hide forever!
You can't hide from me!
You fight like a child!
You're as good as dead!
A bold but foolish move.
Call yourself a warrior?
Come on, put up a fight!
Finally! Let's end this.
Gettin' to old for this.
I send you to your rest.
I'm going to find you...
I'm having fun, are you?
So, you reveal yourself!
Been itching for a fight.
Enough of this! Fight me!
Hmph. Hardly a challenge.
I knew I heard something!
I'll spit on your corpse!
I'm endin' you right now!
Nocturnal, guide my hand!
This shouldn't take long.
Wait, I hear something...
You'll... pay for this...
Your death will be swift!
Come coward, now we fight!
So, it's to the pain then!
Sure, pick on the old guy!
You're nothing but a joke!
You've breathed your last!
I don't have time for this.
You can't get away from me!
You've got moments to live.
And that's why I'm the best.
Didn't even work up a sweat.
Is that the best you can do?
The Emperor can kiss my ass!
You're making this too easy!
Enough games, let's end this!
I think they got the message.
I've killed legions like you!
Let's get this party started.
Coward. Come out and fight me!
I can hear your heart beating.
I must've been hearing things.
Now you're just making me mad.
That was hardly worth my time.
That'll teach you to cross me.
Your death will be my triumph!
Are you trying? 'Cause I'm not.
Come, taste darkness's embrace!
Guess it was nothing after all.
I bring death from the shadows!
The burden of death approaches!
Your blood will adorn my blade!
Come on, you're not even trying!
I claim your soul for Nocturnal!
My blade thirsts for your blood!
Come on, at least try to hurt me.
Come out and face me, you coward!
I'll bury my blade in your heart!
The shadows will be your undoing!
They picked on the wrong old man.
Haven't fought like that in years.
Hiding? The shadows are my domain!
I know you're here. Show yourself.
I promise a swift but painful end!
Where's your precious Emperor now?
Ah good, I could use some practice!
Hiding only prolongs the inevitable.
You were no match for a Nightingale.
You've just written your own epitaph.
Come on, show an old man what you got!
Damn, just as I was getting warmed up.
The afterlife will bring you darkness.
By Nocturnal's grace, I will defeat you!
That wasn't a fight, it was an execution.
Your blood is such a pretty shade of red!
Your feeble attempt to hide is insulting!
Come on. Show me you've got what it takes!
I eat Legionnaires like you for breakfast!
There's no need to hide. I won't hurt you.
You're not a threat... merely an annoyance.
I'll find you... it's only a matter of time.
You just made the last mistake of your life!
I'll cut out your eyes and sell 'em for coin!
That's what happens when you cross the Guild.
Oh come now, resorting to petty tricks are we?
Bless you, Lady of Shadows... I live another day.
I've seen fresh recruits with more skill than you!
Wake me up when you're ready to fight me for real.
I have no problem killing you. How do you feel about dying?
I got something for you. But you'll have to come and get it.
You want me to close my eyes? Would that even things up a little?
You're losing a lot of blood. Maybe you should sit down for a moment.
Fie!
Yeah, fie!
The Order shall rise.
Is there someone out there?
You can't just leave me here!
You have to help me, they are going to kill me!
Grant us this power so that in your name we may vanquish our enemies.
Fie. We beseech you. Darken this gem so that we may use its power to restore The Order of the Black Worm.
We offer this soul to The Revenant: he who watches over the opponents of Arkay and his power over life and death. Fie upon Arkay and his followers!
Hah!
Oh, brother...
That's it! I'm not retiring, ever! End of discussion!
Hah! A girl running a bar? Don't be ridiculous, Minette!
Why not let me run the Skeever? I already know lots about it!
Don't be a silly girl! Running a bar's no job for a young lady.
But you always say you want more girls in the bar to begin with!
I could run the Skeever! You even said I'm almost as smart as you!
You know, I ought to retire and leave you to run the Skeever, son!
I don't know, father... There's a whole world out there I want to see.
It's been a good week, my boy! Loud customers mean good cheer, and good cheer means a full till!
Well, you see, that's a little complicated, and... you know what? Never mind. Guess I'm not retiring anytime soon.
You'd just spend your time here, bossing me around and yelling for more drinks. You're practically retired already...
What about [QUOTE]Auntie Faida[QUOTE] in Dragon Bridge? She runs a bar, and you said she's one of your favorite girls!
Heh.
I do!
Huzzah!
Nothing.
So be it.
It's over.
Rikke. Go.
And Elisif?
And Erikur?
Good point.
How'd I do?
Oh, I know.
Right. Well?
Already done.
Ulfric. Stop.
Eh, not so bad.
Good. It's done.
Secure the door.
What who wanted?
It wasn't so bad.
Sovngarde... sir.
Already done, sir.
It makes us right.
Talos preserve us.
And if I surrender?
Enough... enough...
Ulfric Stormcloak!
You're a damn fool.
Families torn apart?
Just saying goodbye.
Talos be with you...
You're free to leave.
What was that, Legate?
I hate giving speeches.
Damnit woman, stand aside.
I am proud of all of you.
May the gods preserve you.
No... But I belong to her.
You just said it yourself.
And what about Jarl Elisif?
And what about Jarl Erikur?
You've left me no choice...
I pray you're right, Legate.
Yes, what about Jarl Erikur?
It'll make for a better song.
May the gods preserve us all.
Thank you, I thought so, too.
This is the Skyrim you want?!
Well? What are we waiting for?
Nice touch about the High King.
You're also free to die for it.
He has given up. But I have not.
I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak...
We aren't the bad guys you know.
Rikke. You don't have to do this.
We must be prepared to face them.
Yes, what about the Lady Elisif?
It's a foregone conclusion, you know.
Skyrim doesn't belong to you, Ulfric.
That Empire is dead. And so are you.
I hope we haven't just created a martyr.
I'll go gather the men in the courtyard.
Let the Dragonborn be the one to do it.
Not while I'm still breathing, it's not.
That's not the Skyrim I want to live in.
The Empire I remember never surrendered.
Come, Galmar. We've still much work to do.
Come, Rikke. There's still much to be done.
And indeed, there are many that call me hero.
But it is all of you who are the true heroes!
You realize this is exactly what they wanted.
Stand aside woman. We've come for the General.
And indeed, there are many that call us heroes.
Attention! General Tullius has an announcement!
All hail the Emperor. All hail his Legionnaires!
Just kill him and let's be done with it already.
Well, I suppose some kind of speech is in order.
Well Ulfric, you can't escape from me this time.
Maybe not, but you certainly aren't the good guys.
The rebellion is over. Ulfric Stormcloak is dead.
And of course, we couldn't have done it without you.
It's a little more than a rebellion, don't you think?
Well, the men will be expecting some kind of speech.
I'm also free to stay and fight for what I believe in.
Perhaps you're right. But then what does that make you?
They'll no doubt strike whenever and wherever they can.
Come, Galmar. Where's your sense of the dramatic moment?
Step aside Galmar. We're here to accept Ulfric's surrender.
Will he cast aside the Imperial coin falling into his coffers?
And we'll need to hand the city over to that Free-Winter fellow.
Brunwulf. Yes, I've sent men to protect him and bring him here.
Don't you worry about her. I've sent my best men to round her up.
Don't you worry about him. I've sent my best men to round him up.
Stop what? Taking Skyrim back from those who'd leave her to rot?
This is it for you. Any last words before I send you to Oblivion?
To return to our glory and traditions, to determine our own future!
They'll continue to strike out at us, whenever and wherever they can.
Will he acknowledge that we Nords deserve to determine our own future?
I'll never surrender Skyrim into the hands of a corrupt and dying Empire.
This is what you wanted? Shield brothers and sisters killing each other?
Windhelm will need a government quickly if we are to prevent more violence.
In the meantime, we'll continue to root them out and put them to the sword.
The Empire is weak, obsolete. Look at how far we've come and with so little.
Will she acknowledge that it is we Nord's who will determine Skyrim's future?
It matters little to me. Either way I'll be sending your heads back to Cyrodiil.
Any last requests before I send you to... to wherever you people go when you die.
Not until the Moot declares that title should adorn my shoulders will I accept it.
The Aldmeri Dominion may have defeated the Empire, but it has not defeated Skyrim!
The Imperials aren't going to leave us alone. They still have camps in the hills.
Let this day be a final warning to all who would still call themselves Stormcloaks.
We are turning the city over to Brunwulf Free-Winter, an honorable and faithful man.
We couldn't have done this without you. The Empire glories in your accomplishments...
I'm not afraid of the remnants of the Legion, in time they'll all give up and go home.
And it is for these reasons that I cannot accept the mantle of [QUOTE]High King.[QUOTE]
Will he swear fealty to me, that all may know we are at peace, and a new day has dawned?
And in due time, the Moot will meet, and settle the claim to High King once and for all.
There's bound to be resistance. There are many Stormcloak camps tucked away in the hills.
Will she swear fealty to me, so all may know that we are at peace, and a new day has dawned?
But more than that, it was you who fought for Skyrim, for our right to fight our own battles...
There is much to do, and I need every able bodied man and woman committed to rebuilding Skyrim.
A great darkness is growing, and soon we will be called to fight it, on these shores or abroad.
You're wrong. Ulfric. We need the Empire. Without it Skyrim will assuredly fall to the Dominion.
His head will be sent to Cyrodiil where it will adorn a spike on the walls of the Imperial City.
And now, I present to you, Ulfric Stormcloak, hero of the people, liberator and High King of Skyrim!
What I fear, is that the Thalmor will see our victory here and turn greater attention to our shores.
The Legion will be staying here for quite some time. I don't expect there to be any further violence.
It was you who fought the Thalmor and their puppets who would have us deny our gods and our heritage.
But without Ulfric to inflame their passions, they'll settle down and return to their homes eventually.
It was you who fought a dying Empire who sunk its claws into our land, trying to drag us down with it.
You were there with us. You saw it. The day the Empire signed that damn treaty was the day the Empire died.
When we're done rooting out Imperial influence here at home, then we will take our war to the Aldmeri Dominion.
I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the man we know as Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn.
I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the woman we know as Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn.
It was you who fought your kin who didn't understand our cause, who weren't willing to pay the price of our freedom.
By the gods! If it's a good ending to some damn story you're after - perhaps the Dragonborn should be the one to do it.
In appreciation for your exemplary service, I am doubling your pay and compensation to the widows of your fallen comrades.
You are guilty of insurrection, murder of Imperial citizens, the assassination of King Torygg, and high treason against the Empire.
The Thalmor. They stirred up trouble here. Forced us to divert needed resources and throw away good soldiers quelling this rebellion.
You are traitors and will die traitors' deaths. Stand down and face public execution, or advance and face summary execution by my hands.
Then it is settled. The Jarl will continue to rule Solitude, I will garrison armies here to ward off Imperial attempts to reclaim the city.
Many of you will be staying in Windhelm to aid the Jarl in restoring order and stamping out any embers of rebellion that may still smolder here.
Will she put aside her personal hatred for me, and her misplaced love for the Emperor and his coin, so that the suffering of our people will end?
Hey!
Hurry!
Get me out of here!
The guard has the key.
Hmm?
Hrm.
Wonderful, dear. Thank you.
When will you be makin' some more jewelry, love? Some silver lockets and amulets would fetch a nice price at the stand.
Huh?
I don't think so.
You know who I am, fool. So why you askin'?
You blind, boy? I'm a blacksmith. Any half-wit could see that.
You blind, girl? I'm a blacksmith. Any half-wit could see that.
Nid!
Got him!
Faaz! Nah!
That's it!
Steady now!
Take cover!
Damn dragon!
Do vah kiin!
Now! Quickly!
Housecarl! No!
The Jarl's down!
Nivahriin joorre!
Thu'um wah Thu'um!
Ni faas, Dovahkiin!
My Thu'um is strong!
We've almost got it!
Dovahkiin! Here I am!
I think it's holding!
We need to bring it down!
Do not try to hide from me.
We've got to bring it down!
I can't believe that worked!
Shor's bones, here he comes!
Why are we doing this again?
Hold your fire until he's close!
I can't believe I'm still alive.
Keep under cover until it's down!
Your Thu'um is no match for mine.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
You better know what you're doing!
I will conquer where Alduin failed.
But they don't say how he does this.
Something to tell the grandkids, eh?
I'm still amazed that your plan worked.
You'll be the toast of Whiterun for this!
Dragonborn, do whatever you're going to do!
We're ready, Dragonborn. Just say the word.
I claim the glory of your defeat, Dovahkiin!
That's it! Now, wait until he's well inside!
What you're asking for is insane. Impossible!
Zok frini grind ko grah drun viiki, Dovahkiin.
Ah. I forget. You do not have the dovah speech.
No one can doubt that you truly are Dragonborn.
You do have a plan for luring a dragon here, yeah?
What are you waiting for? Let's get this over with.
Get back! Get back! We need to trap it, not kill it!
Go ahead and call this dragon of yours. We're ready.
Horvutah med kodaav. Caught like a bear in a trap...
Steady! Steady, now! Keep under cover until it's down!
Your Thu'um is strong, Dovahkiin. But not strong enough!
My job is to keep the Jarl safe, despite his best efforts.
So this is how you defeated Alduin. Ruth... zu'u ni Alduin.
You're getting pretty good at this dragon-fighting business.
I don't know how you talked the Jarl into this plan of yours.
Od - Ah - Viing. [QUOTE]Winged Snow Hunter,[QUOTE] as I read it.
We may not be trying to kill him, but he sure seems to be trying to kill us!
The old tales say that he is able to travel into Sovngarde to devour the souls of the dead.
You want me to let a dragon into the heart of my city, with the threat of war on my doorstep?
Why would I agree to let a dragon into the heart of my city, after working so hard to keep them out?
You misunderstand our authority. The Greybeards have never involved themselves in political affairs.
Although... it might be difficult to persuade the Jarl to allow you to use his palace as a dragon trap...
An unguessed trove of lost lore... but the important thing is that the Blades recorded many of the names of dragons they slew.
I'm sure you'll manage, though. If you can defeat the World-Eater, surely sweet-talking the Jarl of Whiterun isn't beyond you.
Cross-referencing this with Delphine's map of dragon burial sites, and I believe I've identified one of the dragons that Alduin has raised up.
My... eagerness to meet you in battle was my... undoing, Dovahkiin. I salute your, hmm, low cunning in devising such a grahmindol - strategem.
Nuh!
Ugh!
Grrr!
Ooof!
Arugh!
Grragh!
Nyargh!
Raaarr!
Citizen?
Finally!
Heyargh!
Huuragh!
Raarrgh!
Aiiiieee!
Eyyaargh!
Father...
Pathetic!
Please...
Raaarrgh!
Unworthy!
Ahhhhhhhh!
(Whistling)
Ahhhhh.....
Go on, now.
Grraaagghh!
Grrrarrggh!
Yeeeaaahhh!
Ha ha ha ha!
My Listener?
Well done...
UUggghhhh.....
Yes, Listener?
Ow! Cheap shot!
Brrrr... Chilly.
Hello, Listener.
Hhhhuuuuuhhh....
I live... again.
Lead on, sister.
Lead on, brother.
You may go now...
Damnable jester...
Goodbye, assassin.
My blade is yours.
Ow! What did I do?
Uhh.. thank you...
Coming... Mother...
I am yours, master.
Let's kill someone.
Oooh. Time to kill?
Precious release...
Who's the fool now?
You are not worthy.
What is it you want?
What prey awaits us?
For the Night Mother!
I am yours, mistress.
I... am... eternal...
You can't be serious.
A kill you must repay.
I am yours to command.
Ooh. That had to hurt.
The Dread Lord awaits!
Understood... husband?
Anything good in there?
But... we had a deal...
I weep for you, mortal.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
I return to you, Father.
I... am Lucien Lachance.
I've been expecting you.
You dare invade my home?
Back... to... the Void...
Just say the word, master.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha! I've suffered worse!
Is it information you want?
It all ends here, assassin!
What do you need, Listener?
And another soul for Sithis.
Another thrall for the Void!
Just say the word, mistress.
Another soul for you, Father!
By Sithis, I'll see you dead!
Humble Cicero lives to serve.
I'm bleeding! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Stab you, stab you, stab you!
There is no pain in the Void!
He he he he he he he he he he.
Why are you people doing this?
Fall before the will of Sithis!
You dare invade this Sanctuary?
You won't get that lucky again!
This... this is... an outrage...
You would shut out the darkness?
By Sithis, you will pay for that!
How may I serve you, my Listener?
Ready when you need me, Listener.
Things proceeding well, Listener?
You... you can't do this to me...
Damn it. I gave it away, didn't I?
I grow restless. As does my blade.
Oh Babette, but you are so wicked.
Why you insolent little bastard...
It's all up to you now... Listener.
Walk always in shadow, my Listener.
Yes, Listener? How may I serve you?
So many contracts, so little time...
Come on! Do it again! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Is that the best the Listener can do?
Is that... the best... you can do...
Ow... It hurts when I laugh. He he...
Shadowmere, my old and dear friend...
To arms, brothers! It's the assassin!
What is this madness? Rexus, help me!
Have you... gone... completely... mad?
You are an inspiration. Do you know that?
Bested by a fool. Who's the fool now, hmm?
Ooh. What a fun trick. Teach me, teach me!
I've hardly anything worth pickpocketing...
Lead, and I will follow, child of darkness.
There is murder in the air. I can taste it.
You can't kill what's already dead, mortal.
You reek of death, my friend. I salute you.
Do you need alchemy components? Or training?
Yes, Listener? How can Cicero be of service?
Listener. It is an honor to stand before you.
Oh yes, mistress. Perfectly! You're the boss.
What do you think? Some more Nirnroot, maybe?
Good luck. And try not to get yourself killed.
Wait! That's not how this is supposed to work!
What are you doing? I thought we were friends!
Windhelm. White as bone, and cold as the Void.
You'll never leave this ship alive, cutthroat!
It will... take more than that... to stop me...
The Dark Brotherhood is dead... and so are you!
But now he's dead... and I have a new loincloth.
Our sweet Lady is maiden, mother... and crone...
Your enemies will soon know the wrath of Sithis.
Oh, yes yes yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
...tra la la, tra la lee, da da dum dum, dee dee...
Shouldn't you be out ruining someone's special day?
The Sanctuary must be purged of its invading filth!
I just...  can't take the pain. Not a second longer.
That twisted jester will pay for what's he's done...
What have I done, Listener? Has Cicero offended you?
What? Why would the stranger attack innocent Cicero?
You want the Emperor? You'll have to get through us!
Oh, a big doggy chasing a little kitty! How adorable!
One day, you will serve our Dread Father as I do now.
This how you get your thrills? Feeling up an old man?
What do you expect to find? My juggling balls? He he.
You've got people to kill, my friend. Best get to it.
You must be lost. The tavern is down the road a piece.
I'm afraid I don't have a primary contract for you yet.
You'll never reach the Emperor! Not while I'm standing!
You wish to kill me? Someone has already had that honor.
It's time we put a little kink in the Emperor's security.
No new boots? Does this mean the Argonian is still alive?
Oh yes, mistress. You're the [QUOTE]boss.[QUOTE] For now.
A poison stew, eh? I was always partial to apples, myself.
Cicero is at your service, oh great and powerful Listener!
I like it here. We should have moved to Dawnstar ages ago.
It's... it's like watching an artist create a masterpiece.
See if they have any cheese. I'm getting a bit... peckish.
He he he... Crazy? Cicero? He he he he... That's madness...
I see you're back from Dawnstar. Beitild lies dead, I hope?
Remember the passphrase: [QUOTE]Silence, my brother.[QUOTE]
...Cicero is hungry... ...need a sweetroll... or a carrot...
Dreary, dank, and dimly lit. Truly a Sanctuary to call home.
If I had anything worth giving, I'd have offered it already.
What about you, Festus? How did that last contract turn out?
Should have figured the little lunatic would completely snap.
Excellent. Once again, you've proven yourself a born assassin.
We must return to the Sanctuary! Your Family is in dire peril!
...need to get Mother some flowers... pretty, pretty flowers...
Got to admit, I find the Night Mother's presence... comforting.
I'll admit, even I'm having a hard time disagreeing with you...
The Dread Father works through me. And his work has just begun.
Hey, that's my lint! Ha, Cicero is just joking. You can have it.
...must oil Mother soon... ...get all the hard to reach places...
I'm fairly certain you wandered into the wrong building, friend...
Oh, yes, please, old man. Regale us with your tales of wizardry...
All hail the savior of the Dark Brotherhood! All Hail the Listener!
Go. Quickly. Hide in the coffin before Cicero and the traitor meet.
I'll tell you anything. Anything! Just please stop... hurting me...
Just... just stop. And I'll tell you where I've hidden my treasure.
The Dark Brotherhood is on the rise again, Listener. I can feel it.
Why are you still standing there? Hurry, before the meeting begins.
I took that prancing fool into my home, and this is how he repays me?
We are bonded now, you and I. Joined, through the powers of the Void.
...oh if I chance to see a cat, I'll feed its corpse to my pet rat...
Best put your other tasks aside. The real challenge is about to begin.
...and if I spy a singing bird, I'll snap its neck before it's heard...
Oh, what a kind and wise wizard you are. Sure to earn our Lady's favor.
Still here? What's the matter, can't handle what I'm throwing your way?
I've told you everything I can. I don't know what else you could want...
Keep talking, little man, and we'll see who gets [QUOTE]punished.[QUOTE]
You know, a good Purification might be just what this Sanctuary needs...
...need to sharpen my blade... make it shiny, gleamy, and oh so deadly...
It would seem you're not the accomplished pickpocket you think you are...
You're putting your hand... in my pocket? Have you gone complete cracked?
You smell like dead cat. Can I assume Ma'randru-jo has been taken care of?
...dear Cicero will keep you from harm, sweet Mother. Forever and always...
Hush, Veezara. You were very brave. Astrid may well be dead if not for you.
Ha ha ha ha! Again! Again! Do the part where he tries to buy you some candy.
Oh gods, you've taken everything I have. Just kill me and be done with it...
You're alive. Then I guess you haven't paid a visit to the vampire yet, hmm?
...Oooh... Cicero wants some Skyforge Steel! Sharp sharp, for easy stabbing...
And what of your latest, Arnbjorn. Something about a Khajiit? Merchant was it?
Cicero can talk for a moment. Just a moment. Then Mother must be... tended to.
Go, take care of the Muiri contract. There will be plenty more, I promise you.
Have you talked to Nazir? He's sure to have some additional contracts for you.
You know, I can still sell you some potions and such, or train you in alchemy.
I remember Skyrim from my youth, and the glistening crimson on fields of white.
Perhaps we should find a random stranger to murder. Practice does make perfect.
Do you have any idea who I am? When my father hears about this, he will gut you.
...when I next meet, that fair maid Nelly, I'll plunge my knife into her belly...
For someone called the [QUOTE]Listener,[QUOTE] you do an awful lot of shouting...
Yes. Kill the chef, and then steal his very identity. For that is the true death.
Hmph. No arrows protruding from your skull... Can I assume Anoriath is dead, then?
How went your meeting with Ennodius Papius? Did you prove his paranoia legitimate?
I wish I had more contracts to dole out. You handled those jobs like a born killer.
Please tell me you flayed that horrible bard alive and made a drum from his skin...
So, what of the old beggar, Narfi? Is it done? Has he groveled for his last septim?
Ah, back from Fort Graymoor. The old servant has been put out of her misery, I hope?
Just try to relax, Veezara. Let the elixir do its work. You'll feel better, shortly.
What do you hope to find? Sweets and my dolly? Or maybe some of my spare Nightshade?
You're not actually... picking my pocket? Well, you've got guts. I'll give you that.
And I think we'd both agree, Cicero's brought quite enough madness to this Sanctuary.
...I saw a dwarf! I did! I did! Cicero saw a dwarf! There... Oh. No, sorry. No dwarf...
Off to Solitude with you. Time to give the Emperor some real motivation to visit Skyrim.
You go speak with Muiri. I've got to deal with the Night Mother and her little... clown.
Ahhh.... gotcha! Oh, Listener, you should see the look on your face! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Grelod the Kind was, by all rights, a Dark Brotherhood contract. A kill... that you stole.
Riften. Cicero likes Riften. Cheats and ruffians and cutthroats abound. Finally, some fun.
So... wait. Cicero is alive? And we're all friends again? I swear, I can hardly keep up...
Hmph. [QUOTE]Solitude.[QUOTE] Lonely Cicero could tell you a thing or two about solitude...
The Sanctuary is in the southern Pine Forest. Close to the road, but away from prying eyes.
...Forsworn think they're so scary... Cicero will show you who's scary... Stupid Forsworn...
She's right. I'll be forever in your debt, dearest brother. Now be quiet. Just... just rest.
And now that this Cicero mess has been mopped up, we can get back to the matter at hand, hmm?
I don't have anything for you just yet. Please, talk to Nazir, and see what he has available.
I haven't been touched like that since I visited a certain brothel in the city of Sentinel...
In the meantime, I'll make myself at home in the Sanctuary. I'm sure Mother needs... tending.
Be sure and introduce yourself to your new Family members. They're all very eager to meet you.
Killing the Gourmet will leave an emptiness in the collective soul of Skyrim. This pleases me.
This... this is about the inheritance, isn't it? All right! I'll tell you where I've hidden it.
Will there ever come a time when the people of Skyrim no longer need our services? I think not.
If the Night Mother really did give you an order to talk to a contact, we'd be mad to ignore it.
The new initiates are working out well. Eager, dedicated, and not afraid to get their hands wet.
It's... in a hollowed-out rock. In the tundra. A bit west of Whiterun. Now please... please stop.
Well, well. Looks like one of the Dark Brotherhood rats escaped its burning nest. I can fix that.
You see, that little Aretino boy was looking for the Dark Brotherhood. For me, and my associates.
Achh... Thank you, dear. You are most kind. The jester's cut feels as bad as it looks, I'm afraid.
Speak with Nazir and see if he has any contracts available. I need time to read Motierre's letter.
But make no mistake. I am the leader of this Sanctuary. My word is law. Are we clear on that point?
Oh, be quiet you great lumbering lapdog. The man has had a long journey. You can at least be civil.
Ah, good to see you, sister. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed.
Do you feel it? Magic. Deep and ancient. It resonates from the College, like the beating of a heart.
You haven't faced that pirate captain yet, have you? Safia? I only ask because you're still alive...
Ah, good to see you, brother. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed.
Ah, now I understand. This is about that my father's hidden cache, isn't it? The dowry for my wedding.
The Keeper will be arriving soon, with the body of the Night Mother. So many preparations to be made...
...madness is merry, and merriment's might, when the jester comes calling with his knife in the night...
Maybe I'll make the Potage le Magnifique, hmm? But not the way you make it! Ha ha ha. No, certainly not...
Oh, I do wish to get to know you better. But I must tend to mother. Maybe we can talk for just a moment...
In life, I was but a Speaker for the Black Hand. But you have been named Listener. There is no higher honor.
It's in a hollowed-out tree stump. In the marsh, south of Solitude. Now please, you'll let me go now. Right?
...What? Mother? Is that your voice I hear? Hmm... No, no... Just my head playing tricks... Foolish Cicero...
Maybe I'll make the Potage le Magnifique, hmm? You may have killed the Gourmet, but true artistry never dies.
...is there singing in the Void? Dancing...? Surely the Dread Lord will at least allow poor Cicero to caper...
Ah, yes. Solitude. Seat of the High King of Skyrim. Messy business, kingslaying. Ah, but so very satisfying...
Taken care of that layabout Deekus, yet? Or does the idea of killing a fellow Argonian make your scales crawl?
Damn it, this never should have happened! We knew better. We knew better, and still we let our guards down. Agh!
The Keeper is a sacred position within the Dark Brotherhood. Ask yourself - do you trust the wisdom of our Lady?
Back from your little vacation in Falkreath. So, did you enjoy the sights, sample the food... kill the housecarl?
I'll give you money. Treasure. I have some things hidden away. Take them all. They're yours. Just please... stop.
Why don't you be a dear and let me go now. All right? I won't say a word to anyone. Our little secret. I promise.
...and I said to the baker, [QUOTE]You're not dead! You're a faker![QUOTE] But if that's your wish, I'll oblige...
In my time, the Blades protected the Emperor. It would seem these Penitus Oculatus will prove equally incompetent.
Just north of Windhelm. There's a hollowed-out rock. I have some things hidden in there. Take them! They're yours.
Look. Something is happening here. I'm not sure entirely what that something is, but... Well, we need to find out.
We are the messengers of death, you and I. Together, we will unleash the unholy wrath of our Dread Father, Sithis.
...Cicero never understood thieves, really... take someone's things before you kill them? And they call me crazy...
My time saw the assassination of an Emperor as well. Alas, the Dark Brotherhood did not have the honor of that kill.
The time has come to fulfill your destiny, Listener. Kill the Emperor, and restore the Dark Brotherhood to greatness.
Whiterun, home of the Skyforge. It is said a blade forged in its fires can cut through sinew as if it were parchment.
I will kill this jester if you so desire, but there is a disturbance in the Void. Our Dread Father does not wish this.
Ah, the young and stupid. Always mocking the experienced and brilliant. My contract went very well, I'll have you know.
I do so love Riften. I journeyed here in my youth. A thief took my purse... so I took his eyes. It was a fair exchange.
I'm still trying to find a suitable contract for you. Continue to work with Nazir on the, um, supplemental assignments.
Oh! Oh! Maybe Cicero will go to Jorrvaskr and dance for the Companions! They'll... Um... On second thought... maybe not.
You stand now at the precipice of the Void. I am reminded of another Listener, a protege I knew long ago. So long ago...
...and he says to the man, [QUOTE]That's not a horker! That's my wife![QUOTE] Ha ha ha ha ha... Ah... I love that one...
What are you waiting for? My husband is out there somewhere with that lunatic. Find them! Do what you've been tasked to do!
How went your encounter with  Ma'randru-jo? Back in Hammerfell, I always loved watching two cats rip each other to shreds...
I am not adorable, it was not funny, and he wasn't a merchant. He was a Khajiit monk, a master of the Whispering Fang style.
So, you've returned from Mzinchaleft! A Dwarven ruin... what an exotic place for a kill. Assuming Maluril is actually... dead?
Stalking your prey, planting false evidence, destroying an innocent man's reputation. Truly a contract worthy of the Listener.
...the High King's court needs a jester... But not me. No, not Cicero. The Fool of Hearts is busy enough, thank you very much...
With Vici's murder, you've started us down a path the Dark Brotherhood hasn't traveled in centuries. The assassination of an Emperor.
Mister Cicero, I for one am delighted you and the Night Mother have arrived. Your presence here signals a welcome return to tradition.
But the Night Mother is mother to all! It is her voice we follow! Her will! Would you dare risk disobedience? And surely... punishment?
Ha! Well it's safely hidden away, in a hollowed-out tree stump. Just outside Riften, tucked away nice and secure. You'll never find it.
Now then. Time to proceed to the next stage of the plan. Go and speak with Gabriella. She's been helping me arrange your next contract.
You and the Night Mother are of course welcome here, Cicero. And you will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as Keeper.
I learned to cook from my father. Ah, but that was a long time ago. Before, you know... I killed him. But let's not talk about that now.
Listener, please... if Cicero is going to be a part of this Sanctuary I'll accept that. But can't you do something about the... dancing?
So go. Go to Volunruud. It's a crypt, pretty far to the northeast. Talk to this Amaund Motierre. And let's see where all this leads. Hmm?
Ah, and of course, a bonus, for killing Vici while she addressed her guests, as instructed. Gold... simple and pure. Spend it as you will.
Unfortunately, in your zeal, you failed to eliminate Vici while she addressed her guests, as directed. I'm sorry, but your bonus is forfeit.
Have you heard the tale of Mathieu Bellamont, and the great treachery of Cheydinhal? Kill a boy's mother, and vengeance festers in the son...
Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Write of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him.
Oh yes, please, kind sir. My mama and papa left me all alone, and I'm so very hungry. I know a shortcut to the candy shop. Through this alley.
There you are. Look, I... I just wanted to say thanks for coming to find me. Back in Dawnstar. Crazy jester finally met his match, am I right?
Why am I not surprised to learn Cicero is alive? I still can't stomach the little clown, but if you've welcomed him here, I won't question it.
And now, your reward. A unique spell to summon a legend of the Dark Brotherhood. His soul serves us now in death, as his body once did in life.
Oh ya, very good. Very good. My it is dark down here. Oh, but you are so beautiful. Such a lovely smile. Your teeth... your teeth! No! Aggghh!!
Tell you what. Why don't you hold onto Shadowmere a while longer? He's a fine steed, and hasn't been ridden nearly as much as he should lately.
...ho ho ho, and hee hee hee, break that lute across my knee... and if the bard, should choose to fight, why then I'll set his clothes alight...
Oh yes, it is Cicero! You were a fool to spare me. What, did you think I would be grateful? Cicero should be Listener! Not you! Now you will die!
Oohhh... Cicero's heard about the Butcher. Interesting knifework. Just... Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab! And then... Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab!
You! You're responsible for the siege of Solitude! By Sithis, this undermines all our plans! Fool! Finish that mess, and only then will we speak!
It's true, I'm afraid. Cicero was a little whirlwind, slashing this way and that. It would have been funny, if he weren't trying to murder us all.
Oh, Cicero has returned! Not to kill the kind Listener, but to serve, until one of us dies horribly, in service to our Mother! Best friends forever!
An ancient city, Markarth. Build by the Dwemer, the dwarves of old. To think, an entire race... eradicated. Not even I can take credit for that feat.
You! You're responsible for the siege of that... city! By Sithis, this undermines all our plans! Fool! Finish that mess, and only then will we speak!
Okay, okay. Wait. Here we go. [QUOTE]Ooh, you are such a pretty little girl. Would the sweetie like a sweetie? Oh yes, how about some chocolate?[QUOTE]
Tried a new spell. Little something I've been working on in my spare time. Came [QUOTE]this[QUOTE] close to turning that priest inside out. Damned messy.
Don't forget the ranting and raving. About the Night Mother, how she was the true leader of the Dark Brotherhood, and Astrid was just a [QUOTE]pretender.[QUOTE]
Pfft
Yeah, why?
Why? What's he doing now?
Troll's blood was he a tough one!
Wasn't our last catch a Cave Bear?
Looks like the boss is at it again.
Why, you don't think I could do it?
Take down that one with your bare hands too?
But, I've got the key to the Sabre Cage! Look!
Send another one in here! Send two! I don't care!
So, you're saying you brought that cat down alone?
What's that supposed to prove? Get back on patrol!
One of you get in here! I could put all of you down!
Don't say that to loud, you don't want it getting back to him.
Someone should let that cat lose.  That'd shut him up real quick.
What are you waiting for? I know you want to kill me. Now's your chance!
We've got him locked in there now, but he's still challenging anyone that looks crooked at him.
He's on one of his drunk rants again. Except this time he's challenging everyone to a duel over in the hole.
Ruh!
Aggh!
Heeya!
Hyunh!
Nyagh!
Rragh!
Arrggh!
Hssssss!
Raagghh!
Hrraaggh!
Yeeaaaggh!
Nord... dog!
Yeeeaaagghh!
Just a taste!
For the Reach!
Join the dead!
Pathetic human!
Behold my power!
Fear the Thalmor!
Forsworn forever!
Time to die, hero!
Your shroud awaits!
Bow to your betters!
Disgusting... beast!
Fall to the Thalmor!
Filthy... barbarian!
On your knees, worm!
You are no true Elf!
Bleed for me, mortal!
I offer you eternity!
Gonna rip you... open!
Suffering to all mankind!
Die now, and live forever!
Go ahead, try and fight back!
The elements are mine to command!
Die already so I can take your stuff!
Whatcha gonna do? Huh? Whatcha gonna do?
Gonna split your belly like an old woman's purse!
Shh!
Wait.
Be careful.
Yeah, sure.
Either of you?
Ah! Here it is.
Esbern, what...
Talos guard you.
Esbern, look out!
This looks promising.
Why are you stopping?
Your blood, Dragonborn.
Give me... just a moment...
Looks safe now. Let's move.
We'll cross once it's safe.
Lead on to Sky Haven Temple.
We'd best be careful in here.
We'll meet up near Karthspire.
Look, here. In the third panel.
Yes. These are Akaviri symbols.
Esbern. What are you getting at?
Oh yes! Dragonborn! Indeed, yes.
Let's see what Esbern has to say.
You did it. There's the entrance!
We've got to get this bridge down.
Are you sure this is the right way?
Yes, yes. Let's see what we have...
Do you know what he's talking about?
Now then. I assume you know about...
Gods above, what are you waiting for?
Ah! Here it is. Come, let me show you.
Take care of yourself, Orgnar. Goodbye.
There should be a way to turn this off.
That's done it! Look, it's coming to life!
Wonderful! Remarkably well-preserved, too.
Well, now. That's something to think about.
A wise and foresighted policy, in the event.
It's starting to look like Esbern was right.
So we're looking for a Shout, then. Damn it.
We're here for Alduin's Wall, right, Esbern?
I don't like being out in the open like this.
There's no telling what we might find inside!
Yes. Definitely early Akaviri stonework here.
Are we close? Thalmor spies could be anywhere.
Yeah... sure. You, too, Delphine. You be safe.
A hedge against the forgetfulness of centuries.
Alduin's defeat is the centerpiece of the Wall.
Hmm, Esbern's right. Look like pressure plates.
I think we're getting close. Let's keep moving.
Let's get this door open and see what we've got.
These pillars must have something to do with it.
Yes, that's it. The symbol on the middle pillar.
If you need help drawing some blood, let me know.
Orgnar, hold down the bar for a minute, will you?
Try dripping blood onto the carving on the floor.
But... there's no way to know what Shout is meant.
Well, yes, but... there's no guarantee, of course.
Yes, yes! I think we must be close to the entrance.
Yes, that's it. The symbol on the pillar on the left.
I know the prophecy by heart. Once all Blades knew it.
Yes, that's it. The symbol on the pillar on the right.
We must be getting close. We should proceed cautiously.
You mean they used a Shout to defeat Alduin? You're sure?
Esbern. We need information, not a lecture on art history.
I must speak to Delphine at once. There's no time to lose.
We should be careful here. See these symbols on the floor?
[QUOTE]When the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped[QUOTE]
Delphine! I... it's good to see you. It's been... a long time.
So this is where Delphine has been hiding all these years? Hmm.
I would suggest staying on the plates with the Dragonborn symbol.
Look here! You see how the ancient Blades revered Reman Cyrodiil.
Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again.
So you think that Alduin's Wall will tell us how to defeat Alduin?
So, does it show how they defeated him? Isn't that why we're here?
[QUOTE]When the Snow Tower lies sundered, kingless, bleeding[QUOTE]
Fascinating! Original Akaviri bas-reliefs... almost entirely intact!
[QUOTE]When the thrice-blessed fail and the Red Tower trembles[QUOTE]
You mean... you don't mean to say you haven't heard of Alduin's Wall?
Here are the Akaviri - the Blades - you see their distinctive longswords.
Sky Haven Temple it is, then. I knew you'd have something for us, Esbern.
Orgnar, this is it. The inn is yours. I'm probably never coming back here.
[QUOTE]When misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world[QUOTE]
Amazing, eh? To be standing at the very entrance to Sky Haven Temple itself!
It's good to see you, too, Esbern. It's been too long, old friend. Too long.
Remember, this is where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return.
Esbern's probably right. Try using your blood on the carved seal on the floor.
Well, I'm going to look around some more. See what the old Blades left for us.
Are you paying attention, Delphine? You might learn something of our own history.
[QUOTE]The World-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Dragonborn.[QUOTE]
Here, the humans rebel against their dragon overlords -- the legendary Dragon War.
Whatever you did, it worked. Let's see what else those old Blades left in our way.
[QUOTE]When the Dragonborn Ruler loses his throne, and the White Tower falls[QUOTE]
The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps...
Well, then. You made it, safe and sound. Good. Come on, I have a place we can talk.
I've told you where Sky Haven Temple is. I'll trust you to get us there in one piece.
snort of derision. Wordless [QUOTE]bah![QUOTE] or [QUOTE]harrumph![QUOTE], basically.
Hmm? Oh, yes. Presumably something rather specific to dragons, or even Alduin himself.
Alduin isn't getting any weaker while we stand around here gawping at the architecture.
Let's see... you have the symbol for [QUOTE]King[QUOTE]... and [QUOTE]Warrior[QUOTE]...
This looks promising. Akaviri stonework, I think. Reminds me a bit of Cloud Ruler Temple.
Yes... yes, that's an excellent idea. Who knows what other lost treasures we might discover?
This is where they built Alduin's Wall, to set down in stone all their accumulated dragonlore.
Yes, of course. We'll have more time to look around later, I suppose. Let's see what's up ahead.
The prophecy which brought the Akaviri to Tamriel in the first place, in search of the Dragonborn.
After you, Dragonborn. You should have the honor of being the first to set foot in Sky Haven Temple.
Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again. Not lost, you see, just forgotten.
Let's pretend we haven't. What's Alduin's Wall and what does it have to do with stopping the dragons?
Amazing... you can see how the Akaviri craftsmen were beginning to embrace the more flowing Nordic style...
You see, here he is falling from the sky. The Nord Tongues -- masters of the Voice -- are arrayed against him.
Now they kneel, their ancient mission fulfilled, as the Last Dragonborn contends with Alduin at the end of time.
Ah... here's the [QUOTE]blood seal.[QUOTE] Another of the lost Akaviri arts. No doubt triggered by... well, blood.
Yes, yes. This here, coming from the mouths of the Nord heroes -- this is the Akaviri symbol for [QUOTE]Shout.[QUOTE]
Not lost, you see, just forgotten. The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps...
Look, here is Alduin! This panel goes back to the beginning of time, when Alduin and the Dragon Cult ruled over Skyrim.
Alduin's Wall was where the ancient Blades recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy.
Patience, my dear. The Akaviri were not a straightforward people. Everything is couched in allegory and mythic symbolism.
Right. Good thing they've already let you into their little cult. Not likely they'd help Esbern or me if we came calling.
This whole place appears to be a shrine to Reman. He ended the Akaviri invasion under mysterious circumstances, you recall.
Sky Haven Temple. An ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden deep in the crags of the Reach. That's where we'll find Alduin's Wall.
Despite the far-reaching fame of Alduin's Wall at the time - one of the wonders of the ancient world - its location was lost.
Given that Sky Haven Temple was sealed against the return of the Dragonborn, I would try turning all the pillars to that symbol.
This changes everything, of course. There's no time to lose. We must locate...  let me show you. I know I had it here, somewhere...
After the so-called [QUOTE]battle[QUOTE] of Pale Pass, the Akaviri went into his service. This was the foundation stone of the Second Empire.
We'll look around Sky Haven Temple and see what else the old Blades might have left for us. It's a better hideout than I could have hoped for.
You see, right here. Sky Haven Temple, constructed around one of the main Akaviri military camps in the Reach, during their conquest of Skyrim.
Alduin's Wall... one of the lost secrets of the Blades. Where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy.
Shor's bones! Here it is! Alduin's Wall... so well preserved... I've never seen a finer example of early second era Akaviri sculptural relief...
And of course the symbol for [QUOTE]Dragonborn.[QUOTE] That's the one that appears to have a sort of arrow shape pointing downward at the bottom.
Sir!
Sir.
Yes!
Again?
What?!
Alright.
Breathe!
Finally.
You there.
Prey waits.
This is it.
But... sir...
Sir, I tried.
So it begins.
We're ready.
It's time to act.
Whenever you are.
It seems cowardly.
It's time to decide.
They have catapults.
So about this axe...
Already taken care of.
You were right Galmar.
He'll do no such thing!
I'm in no mood to joke.
Yes, to General Tullius.
How long until they arrive?
I'm of a mind with Irileth.
You're certain we're ready?
Are we writing a letter, Lord?
Damnit! This isn't about gold!
Damnit. What's he waiting for?
Oh, he's serious. But so am I.
You plan to march on Windhelm?
The chests of gold didn't hurt.
Take a moment to breathe, soldier.
And I'm sure you could do it, too.
The men will be fighting in flames.
Whiterun is only a means to an end.
Why didn't you say so immediately?!
Sir! I... I have... <breathing hard>
Ulfric is the one who has offended.
If you prefer I took my men and left...
He was rather straight forward with Torygg.
So, he wants to take my city, walls intact.
Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious.
The men are already gathering at the gates.
I've toured our camps. We're ready, Ulfric...
Move it soldier. Spread the word. Go. Go. Go.
Not long. They're hiding in the country side.
Give the word, my lord, and Whiterun is yours.
I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy.
