My eyes inside Cidhna Mine tell me that Madanach is dead.
You've done a great service to the Silver-Blood family. I've had the Jarl officially pardon you, and taken care of a few other loose ends.
Nice try, but those bandits almost killed me. Now pay up.
Well... all right. Just because we are friends. Give me, say... 750 gold and we can call it even.
No? Do you care about rotting away for a month in a cell?
Ah, but nobody wants that, right? Painful for you, annoying for me. So, you pay my fine... and you walk away.
Not my finest hour. Roggvir was a fine and honorable man.
Of course... your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lad.
Of course... your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lass.
Keep doing right by us and there's plenty more where that came from.
Oh, goodness no. There are those far more skilled than I.
Oh, no skeevers out here, sir. They can't stand the cold.
You just need to remember that there's a war on, and firewood isn't cheap these days.
Sorry, sir. These old bones do like a bit of warmth in the evening. There's no need to make fun.
Make sure the back fence is repaired. I swear I saw some skeevers in nibbling the leaves yesterday.
Maybe, but the way you burn through all that wood to keep the cabin toasty, they might mistake this place for Elsweyr.
Oh, okay. I didn't think you'd help me. Nobody ever does.
Pay you to protect me? You can't even protect yourselves!
Petty threats and fist waving are not going to sway me. You people are all talk, and everyone knows it!
She's here? By Sithis, I thought we'd lost her. Let's go!
Silana, you don't seem yourself. Is something the matter?
Oh, yes sir. I feel many of Solitude's families are having trouble getting by, and the wealthy do nothing to help them!
I respectfully disagree, sir. Stendarr and Zenithar may demand strength from them, but Mara and Dibella demand compassion from us.
I see you have meditated on this subject quite thoroughly. I shall not stop you, but please, try to attend to your temple duties as well.
Your compassion is admirable, but you see, we cannot help them all. The poor must learn from the examples of the gods and raise themselves up.
Silent means I don't tell and it's none of your business.
So many say that, at first, until they realize the truth.
If you change your mind, speak to Braig. Tell him I sent you. I want you to know how widespread the injustice of Markarth is.
So what happened at the watchtower? Was the dragon there?
You've done a great service for me and my city, Dragonborn.
I want you to go with Irileth and help her fight this dragon.
There's no time to stand on ceremony, my friend. I need your help again.
You survived Helgen, so you have more experience with dragons than anyone else here.
Help Irileth kill this dragon before it can attack Whiterun. There's no time to lose.
So, he says to petition Malacath for relief? Interesting.
Stand back. Interrupting an execution is a serious crime.
Svana, I heard that Sibbi was put in jail. What happened?
Come to think of it, I haven't seen Svidi in a while. Wait... he didn't...
They say... well, they say he murdered someone. Something to do with Svidi.
No, it was Svidi's brother, Wulfur. She's in hiding now. Somewhere far from here I'd suspect.
If he wasn't a Black-Briar, I'd march right over to the jail and teach Sibbi some manners... but then I suppose I'd end up like Wulfur.
That is all I will say, for it grieves me to speak of it.
Because that's what traitorous cowards do when they desire power.
When Ulfric unleashed such fury, my husband he... he simply ceased to be.
Now it would seem Ulfric has his wish. And there truly is no justice in the world.
Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more than Torygg.
And so he came before my husband and he... he shouted. With that terrible voice. Like something out of a legend... Or a nightmare.
That's all I can do, you idiot. What are you waiting for?
That's her business. Not mine. Probably not yours either.
That's how I slipped in there. Should still be unguarded.
Well, there's an old sewer tunnel that dumps into the lake on the northwest side of the island.
The kind that evaluates your usefulness during... duress.
The Mace of Molag Bal! I give you its true power, mortal.
When your enemies lie broken and bloody before you, know that I will be watching.
The Wabbajack! Huh? Huh? Didn't see that coming, did you?
Care to take a look around? This is not, I dare say, the Solitude botanical gardens. Have you any idea where you are? Where you truly are?
Welcome to the deceptively verdant mind of the Emperor Pelagius III. That's right! You're in the head of a dead, homicidally insane monarch.
Now, I know what you're thinking. Can I still rely on my swords and spells and sneaking and all that nonsense? Sure, sure. Or... you could use...
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Winterhold.
I grant you this weapon from the armory to serve as your badge of office.
I'll also notify the guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now.
Then it is true what they said? I am touched by the gods?
These spells are difficult, even for one as skilled as I.
To even begin to inscribe them, I need something very special. A sigil stone from an Oblivion gate.
I do not have one in my possession. Nor do you, I'm sure. So we require a Daedra to retrieve one for us.
You will summon a Dremora, and order it to bring a sigil stone to you. I will then inscribe the spells for you.
This good deed should not go unrewarded. Here, take this!
Very good, Thongvor. It relieves me to hear you say that.
Oh, very well. I'll send my brother. He'll straighten this out.
Thongvor, I have the latest reports from Cidhna Mine and the smelter. We should go over them immediately.
Reburrus, there is a war being fought across all of Skyrim, and you bother me with the usual mundane reports about silver?
Look at these figures, Thongvor! Ore yield is down by half, and the amount of silver bars being smelted is slipping even more than that.
We are the Greybeards, followers of the Way of the Voice.
You stand in High Hrothgar, on the slopes of Kynareth's sacred mountain.
Here we commune with the voice of the sky, and strive to achieve balance between our inner and outer selves.
We have an interest in one of those boats, the Icerunner.
The Solitude Lighthouse will be guiding it in... but if its fire were to go out, the Icerunner would run aground.
With the war, many more ships come through these docks. Loaded with weapons and pay, but few people. And they pass through dangerous waters.
What's a man to do if he can't look to his Jarl for help?
Trust you saw the house that burned down. Peculiar bit of business, that was.
And that's on top of noises from the marsh in the night, tales of monsters, and now this wizard in our midst.
Yes, lad, you've been raised into the Companions, I hear.
I can fashion whatever kind of weapon you want. Finest forge in Skyrim, right here before you.
You must take the Lexicon from me. Please... take it now.
The memories. I cannot stand them. You must take them away, return them to Avanchnzel.
You trespass here, shadow-walker. Shor does not know you.
Perhaps before the end you will earn the right to pass this way.
Welcome I do not offer, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand.
You've been quiet so far. What do you think we should do?
You've seen them? Then waste no time, head there at once!
The longer they're around, the more danger I'm in! Please, kill Kematu and end this nightmare for me!
Please, I know I'm asking you to do something difficult, maybe even dangerous. I just don't know who else I can trust.
I heard one of them was just arrested trying to sneak into the city. If he's locked up in the jail, perhaps you can get it out of him.
Your pockets... they're a little low on coin. I can tell.
I'm saying you've got the coin but you didn't earn a septim of it honestly. I can tell.
[QUOTE]Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire![QUOTE]
A few coins for my soul? If only you understood the irony.
I don't think you understand. I'm not answering questions.
Ah, yes. Umm, no. No, I don't think so. Not at this point.
But the implications are quite intriguing, I think. I simply need some experimental results to confirm my suspicions.
It's just that, well I'm not even really sure it's going to amount to anything just yet. All theoretical right now, you understand.
All right, all right. It's Karliah... her name is Karliah.
Always. Let's go see if we can find this Sky Haven Temple.
Are you quite sure? I don't want to get in the way, but...
As a matter of fact, there is something you can do for me.
What? Oh, no. No, no. I need more time to research the dwarven machinery. Thank you for offering, though.
As anyone will tell you, Morthal can be a dangerous place.
My... talents... are useful here. I help maintain order, even if it goes unnoticed.
Beyond asking for you, he never said. Very strange indeed.
Brand-Shei... have you managed to find those boots for me?
Um... okay. Well, the boots aren't here yet. Hopefully on the next Khajiit caravan.
What's with all the boots and shoes you keep buying? You must have bought twenty pairs in the last two years.
Always be prepared. You never know if you might get a split in one, or lose one, then where would you be? No sir, that's not happening to me.
By the gods, that man nearly killed me. You saved my life.
Thank you again. I can't believe I was this close to being killed.
Thank you. Here, I was going to bring this to my sister, but I think you should have it.
Careful with those. Don't want even more fragments, do we?
Corruption, lies and deceit are the order of the day here.
If it wasn't for Aerin, the young man who saved my life, I think I'd already have given up long ago.
Its been difficult. I've taken the burdens of this city's problems upon myself and I keep running into impossible obstacles.
Fine. I can't force you to help me, but the offer is open.
Forgive me milady, I didn't recognize you! Please proceed.
Forgive me milord, I didn't recognize you! Please proceed.
Good luck getting one of the guards to help with anything.
I tried to get Ulfric to even come down here to see the squalor, but the High Lord of His Mightiness couldn't find the time.
Well you see where we have to live. This forgotten alley. All the filth from the upper quarters flows downhill, like they say.
Good. Now move quickly. And don't leave any of them alive.
Here, I had him make you a few things for all that travel.
Thank you. I'll be sure to get Elgrim to examine this as soon as his... busy schedule allows.
Here, please accept this gift as a token of our gratitude.
Finally, we can reopen the mine and put Shor's Stone back on the map!
Hey... So are you ever going to make me invisible or what?
I hear Endon's quite pleased to have his merchandise back.
He's a powerful ally in Markarth. Should help the Guild regain a foothold in the west.
I'm going to keep preparing the body, if you'll excuse me.
Eehhh... no. Sorry. But I did notice that her coinpurse was still intact, so whoever did this wasn't after gold.
I'm going to keep this short 'cause we've got a lot to do.
Honningbrew's owner, Sabjorn, is about to hold a tasting for Whiterun's Captain of the Guard and we're going to poison the mead.
I've finally tracked down the last of the Totems, I think.
I had once heard Skjor and Kodlak talking about the Totems of Hircine.
Once Kodlak began looking for his cure, I'd wager Skjor didn't bring it up again.
Simple-looking objects that could channel the powers of the werewolf in new directions.
The information wasn't easy to come by, but everyone has a price. And a pain threshold.
But I was going through his things and found a book I had never seen before. All about the Totems.
I've been talking to my sources around the holds, and think I may have heard where one of them lives.
I think I've located another one of the Totems. Come with me, and we'll write ourselves into their history.
If you die, then I'll have no further use for your corpse.
I'm sending you to clear out Fort Hraagstad. If you survive, you'll pass.
If you want my opinion I say it's just plain old bad luck.
Who knows. Old Delvin thinks it's some kind of a curse. I think he's crazy.
Is that sarcasm? I've heard better wisecracks from Orgnar.
Still, you have a point. Camilla letting Faendal visit her isn't a good thing for me.
Here, let me give you a particularly venomous letter. Say it's from Faendal. That should get Camilla to stop inviting the elf over.
It's the damn outlanders and Empire that need the reasons.
Reasons? Since when does a man need a reason to protect his family, to defend his homeland?
Look, I had no choice. They're crazy... I could be killed!
Look, you want to know about me? All right, I'll tell you.
Didn't have a coin to spend between our entire family. Ate the same slop we fed our livestock.
I'll tell you about the time I was a young girl, barely out of her teens... living on a pig farm in the middle of nowhere.
Maven has been nagging us about her request. Any thoughts?
Remind me why we even bother to allow him to be a part of the Guild.
Two reasons. He's rich and because we need every sword we can get right now.
Yes, I know. That last job was my fault. I obviously thought Niruin was ready, but I was wrong.
Do we have anyone reliable to send out there? I don't want to look the fool again in front of her, Brynjolf.
No. Of course you're right, Unmid. I'll stay here for now.
Begging your pardon my lady, but I strongly recommend against it.
Unmid, I wish to travel about the city. Prepare an escort please.
Anuriel seems to think that seeing me on the streets might bolster the city's morale.
My lady, there could be agents of the Empire looking for an opportunity like that to have you killed. Are you willing to take that risk?
Of course not. You expect me to take care of it by myself?
She's been with me ever since her parents were killed by bandits and she was dropped in my lap.
My niece Svana helps me with the chores. She'd be more help if she kept her head out of the clouds.
Oh, splendid! Just splendid! Mara smiles upon us this day.
Allow me to give you her gift... a true blessing to aid you in times of need. Despair not, her warmth will protect you always!
Oh, thank Arkay. Please, take this gold for your troubles.
Well, would you look at that! Argonian Ale! My thanks, friend. Here, take this here healing potion. I, er, [QUOTE]found[QUOTE] it in the temple.
Oh! Are you going to teach me how to turn into a mud crab?
Now, clear your mind and breathe deeply. Good concentration is very important for spellcasting.
Wow! Then I could dive into a river and swim so far away that Britte and father could never find me.
Oh, it's much better than that. I will teach you how to breathe underwater, with no need to turn into one of those ugly creatures.
Today I'll teach you a useful spell that might just save your life. If you should ever fall into a river, you'll be very glad you learned it.
Please, will you help me? There's no one here I can trust.
I'm sorry, just... Just don't hurt me. I know you're not one of them, but you just can't help them. You can't let them know I'm here.
So, that's how I earned the name. Now keep it to yourself.
Well, I had forgotten we had our horses tied up just outside of Windhelm... Vex rode hers back and arrived hours before I did.
That's the spirit. Vilkas, here, will get started on that.
The graveyard has been lonely. Few pay homage to the dead.
Few want to be reminded of mortality in a time of war, Kust.
The life of a soldier is full of hardship. That's nothing.
And I've seen the face of evil. It was in the air above Sentinel on the Night of Green Fire.
But they send the Legion to places that've gotten too bad to be settled without violence. What's hard is seeing good people warped by evil.
There's something you could do for me. For all of us here.
Visitors to the city usually stay at the Silver-Blood Inn.
She's not from Markarth. The air about her screamed [QUOTE]outsider.[QUOTE]
Volunruud? Well, that is interesting. I know this place...
We don't all lead your life of grand adventure, Harbinger.
Not at this rate. I'll just go back to clubbing horkers and scaring the debtors.
We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey.
This is the headquarters of the Nightingales, cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind.
Well I can't just tell that to any skeever that washes up.
Haldyn will take my hide for this, but Skyrim's been feeling a bit confining lately.
From the look of you, I'm guessing you're more looking to cause some trouble for the Horkers.
We draw council at Japhet's Folly. The fools in Windhelm won't go near it, which is fine by us.
If you'll pardon me now, my crew needs gathering. Should be in Hammerfell before the other Horkers know who let slip their secret.
Well, if you do, grab him and yell. Bastard stole from me.
Well, that's just about the best news I've heard all week.
This key opens one of my drop spots in the basement of the meadery. Take anything inside you like.
I was going to give this to whomever killed her for me, but I suppose you've earned it by bringing me this information.
Well, your classmates certainly seem to disagree with you.
What? How? I thought they weren't allowed within the city!
While I appreciate the sentiment, I still have to decline.
However, I must insist that my laboratory remains strictly off limits.
Being an admirer, I'm sure you can appreciate the need to keep my research a secret.
Here, this key will provide access to my museum. Feel free to browse for as long as you wish.
What kind of a mentor would I be if I denied a potential student a glimpse at his master's ingenuity!
Why, perhaps the greatest crime spree Skyrim's ever known.
There are pockets brimming with coin and coffers overflowing with riches ripe for the picking.
We may be Nightingales, but in our hearts we're still thieves and we're damn good at what we do.
With just myself and one child, it's damn near impossible.
With Leifnarr gone, it's really put me in a terrible bind. I'm having trouble making ends meet.
At this rate, we won't last more than a few more seasons at best. Then I'll just have to sell the old place.
Yes, well so do I. That's why I was hoping you could help.
Yes, wouldn't want to miss the lush summer we have ahead.
I was wondering if you had ordered the shipment of that frostwheat, sir.
I wasn't wanting to get anyone in trouble, sir. Just wanting to get the new planting started, is all.
Yes, but that fool Endario can't get it in. I'll thrash him when I get back to the city, don't you worry.
Yes, your head hurts and you don't remember where you are.
You know, I've heard the Gourmet is in Skyrim right now...
You must have had a wild night if you can't remember that.
I'm sure your bride-to-be will tell you when you where the ceremony will be.
If she still wants to marry you when you tell her you can't afford the ring.
You said the ceremony was going to be at Morvunskar. Don't forget you still owe me!
But I suppose everyone gets the jitters before their wedding. And I did say you could take a bit of time paying me back.
You one of those [QUOTE]Skyrim for the Nords[QUOTE] types?
You're looking for something, yes? The... Staff of Magnus.
Well, even if you are trying to ruin my work, there's still something to be learned here.
Ah, a secret admirer, eh? Don't worry, I won't tell a soul.
All right. I have everything you asked for all ready to go.
You just better hope this one isn't another waste of my coin.
I don't understand it either. They were a sure thing, I swear.
I hope this deal goes through. I'm putting quite a bit of coin on the line... and the last two you set up fell through.
All right. Mother is just outside this door. I have a plan.
Always was a stubborn woman. She's not going to stand down.
War always comes down to this, doesn't it? A single truth-laden moment.
Dragonborn... Perhaps this is the fate of Skyrim after all. To be destroyed from the inside.
And as for you, I owe you a portion of the reward, don't I?
Not on the way back. Once she gets there, it's not up to me to decide what's done with her.
Well, here you go. Spend it wisely, and if I may... Don't allow yourself to be fooled by a pretty face. You're better than that.
And what would my impetuous Thane Bryling suggest, instead?
Listen to you, speaking of sacrifice. You've never gone hungry a day in your life, Erikur!
That is quite enough. Perhaps I will raise these issues when I have an audience with General Tullius.
Simple. Let the Empire fight its own war, with its own funds, and without hijacking our supplies and soldiers. Let Haafingar rebuild.
The Stormcloaks only rebel because the Empire uses Skyrim as its personal larder. The more they take, the more support the rebels gain!
As you know, Solitude's coffers are much depleted by the war efforts. Thane Erikur, you have a strong head for business. What do you suggest?
My lady... Surely you're not that naive. Such foolishness would only leave us defenseless. The rebels would storm the palace in an afternoon.
This is an unfortunate but unavoidable ebb in revenue. But as long as we continue to support the Empire, our sacrifices will be well rewarded.
Before we begin, I want to make two things perfectly clear.
And two, you follow my lead and do exactly as I say... no questions, no excuses.
One, I'm the best infiltrator this rathole of a Guild's got, so if you think you're here to replace me, you're dead wrong.
But somehow they're still here, and they're killing people.
They're remnants of the old rulers of Markarth. Natives of the Reach. Followers of the old ways.
The Nords drove them out of the city. Ulfric Stormcloak and his men. That was about 20 years ago.
But we've had no contact with them for quite some time now.
Ah, that. Yes, the group prior to yours has disappeared entirely.
It's possible that there was less than the necessary amount of oversight. That's still being looked into.
Arniel wondered if perhaps they'd somehow managed to get themselves lost in the Outer Realms, but I think that's giving them too much credit.
But, well... There is one more thing. If you're interested?
Excellent. Once Alain is dead, I'll pay you. In gold. I've saved up a bit. I hope that'll do.
By Ysmir's beard, the nerve of those Imperial bastards, eh?
To think that we would sit down with that... Thalmor bitch. I say she walks or we walk.
What do you think? I can't let Ulfric dictate terms to me before the negotiations even start.
What do you think? Are we going to let Ulfric dictate terms to us before the negotiations even start?
To think that I would sit down at the same table with that... Thalmor bitch. Either she walks or I do.
Careful though, rumor has it a dragon makes its home there.
The last traveler that traded me some said he found them at a place called Ancient's Ascent.
Well, I'd be careful if I were you. I hear the Nords hunt them for some kind of initiation rite and not all of them end up victorious.
Give my regards to Tonilia. Tell her I'll contact her soon.
You'll find Ri'saad with his caravan group. Just don't do anything stupid when you get there.
Grelka! Lower your voice before you get us both in trouble.
So, Brand-Shei... business as awful for you as it is for all of us?
Well, let's all raise a flagon to Ulfric; future King of Skyrim and bringer of poverty to the working class!
Worse. The Khajiit Caravans are the only way to get supplies into the city, and even those are becoming more infrequent.
Here, this is fresh. I'll have another meal ready tomorrow.
I can. Here. This is fresh. I'll have another one made tomorrow.
Here. This is from a recipe my people have passed on to me. I can cook another tomorrow.
A warrior marches on the gut. Here. This should give you strength. I'll cook another tomorrow.
Here. Wouldn't want you going into a fight on an empty stomach. I'll have another meal ready tomorrow.
Here you are. I added a little mead into the recipe. I think it tastes better. Let me know what you think tomorrow, I'll make another one.
I should be asking you the same question, but all right. I'll cook. Here, try this, and don't you dare ask for another one before tomorrow.
Hmm. Maybe in a few seasons I could afford such a treasure.
I do have one set of bracelets in a style that is popular with the nobility in Sentinel.
Kerah, do you have anything... exotic? Something no other woman in Markarth would be wearing.
Sentinel? That's in Hammerfell, correct? And you say these bracelets are only worn by the nobility?
They are popular with the nobility there, yes. This particular bracelet is a copy of one worn by a Crown Princess.
Hmm. Yes. They are very protective of me. Bahlaan fahdonne.
But I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis. It cannot be known to me.
How are the necklaces selling, my wife? We could make more.
I need to get back to the customers. We'll talk more of this when I come home tonight.
As they always have, along with those crazed Forsworn. They've driven off the color that used to make this city great.
We don't have travelers from Elsweyr or Hammerfell anymore, Endon. Only the natives and the Nords stay in Markarth now.
I'm afraid the necklaces aren't selling well. Customers are not interested in medallions engraved with the symbols of other provinces.
Humph. Used to be everyone in Markarth wore a necklace showing his home province, from Elsweyr to High Rock to Hammerfell and Cyrodiil...
How can we? We're a community of farmers, not fighting men.
If not for the war, we might have enough guards in the hold to protect the settlements. That the dragons should return now is most unfortunate.
I am as my father Akatosh made me. As are you... Dovahkiin.
I am one of them. A werewolf. It's my secret, and my shame.
That's why I wanted the ring... it was said to give men like me control.
I'm sure you've heard of men who shift to beasts under the influence of the moons.
Now I may look like a man, but I still feel the animal inside of me, as strong as ever.
I don't suppose there's a point in keeping the secret if I'm going to die in here anyway.
I only just got my hands on it. I can only work so quickly.
It's coming along slowly. I expect there will be some results soon.
We were able to figure out the last text you brought in. I thought the least I could do is pass the knowledge along.
I understand you purchase used goods, as well as sell them?
Yes, that's right. Whether or not I'm interested depends on what you've got, of course.
I have some things that belonged to my daughter, Friga. She... she won't be needing them any more.
Oh, I see. Yes, yes of course I'll take a look. Just bring them by whenever it's convenient for you.
I understand. If you should change your mind, I'll be here.
I wish I could afford to pay you both, Narri.  I really do.
At some point we should hire Tekla on here. If she could just spend less time serving Dengeir...
I'd rather not talk about my daughter, if you'll excuse me.
I'm sorry -- she was very dear to me, and it's rather painful to think about.
I'm afraid your bargaining without the metal to back it up.
That would be acceptable. You can tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
I'm doing as you asked. This is for some good purpose, yes?
I admit, I've never felt entirely at ease in the Thalmor embassy.
Take advantage of the fine food and drink. Such things have been scarce since the war began.
A Jarl has many duties. Attending parties isn't the most important one, but neither is it unpleasant.
I came here hoping to learn that more Imperial reinforcements were on their way to Skyrim, but so far I've been disappointed.
I'm not asking you to defy the Jarl, just to open his eyes.
Proventus, you must help me. We need to convince my brother to do more for the war effort.
Use subtlety and suggestion to turn his thoughts to the war. You're his steward, he'll listen to you.
What would you have me do, Hrongar? Your brother is the Jarl. You know I can't question his judgement.
Leave me out of your intrigues, Hrongar. If you have something to say to the Jarl, say it with you own tongue.
If it were to somehow end up in my hands, I wouldn't argue.
They have a dark elf who oversees their operations. Suvaris Atheron.
Not yet, no. But perhaps an intrepid person such as yourself could help with that.
She's meticulous to a fault, and keeps a logbook with every transaction she makes.
If you're thinking of applying, talk to Viarmo in Solitude.
It's a school that teaches music, poetry, that sort of thing. Most bards in Skyrim have been to the college at some point.
In some ways, yes, but there is often opportunity in chaos.
Not that I'd ever get involved in any of those kinds of things, of course.
When a new government takes charge, records can be lost, taxes can be forgotten and laws aren't always enforced.
The new guards are often too busy learning their responsibilities to notice a few smuggled goods or minor robberies.
It ended the war and saved the Empire to fight another day.
Seems to me like it just ended... it's never really ended for me.
The Great War... only thirty years past and already ancient history to most people.
Also trampled on the sacred name of Talos, and gave the Thalmor free reign to stamp out Talos worship throughout the Empire.
But to answer your question, the White-Gold Concordat was the fancy name they put on the peace treaty between the Empire and the Thalmor.
It may be worth attempting contact with Malacath after all.
Go to Malacath's shrine, southeast of Largashbur. See if perhaps he will aid us after all.
Perhaps. But he spoke of this [QUOTE]curse[QUOTE] to you, which means it has deeply affected him.
Malborn? Ah... very good. I think we understand each other.
No need to explain, I'm well aware of your Guild's methods.
It took me weeks, but I finally tracked down the killer. A bloody Altmer at that. Can you imagine?
No, it.. it can't be. I haven't heard that name in decades.
This is grave news indeed, she's someone I hoped to never cross paths with again.
Now I'm here to study Conjuration. That's what's important.
No, I suppose we haven't. Brelyna Maryon, of House Telvanni. First of my family to leave Morrowind in a long time.
Now if that don't answer your question, then no words will.
We've got honor. Wealth and titles, too. Aye, and buxom women to warm your bed on a cold Skyrim night.
Battle-Born is a name out of legend, sung in the songs of old and heard in deeds of valor for a hundred generations.
[QUOTE]For Clan Battle-Born![QUOTE] they cry in the mead halls. [QUOTE]First into the fray and last to quit their ale![QUOTE]
Now, how would you like me to align the Phial's properties?
What's it matter to you? Not like you could do anything about it.
It's just one of those things that happens. The lungs just... give up. Even elves get old.
I'm not as skilled as Curalmil, so I'm afraid it will only ever refill with one type of liquid.
Just a man's life work, is all. I've finally derived the location of the White Phial, but this doting busybody won't let me get it.
Oh, if I had my full power, granting that would be trivial.
I'd simply snap my fingers, and everyone in Skyrim would die. War resolved.
Oh, right, they said you were captured crossing the border.
Still, I'm surprised you haven't heard of Ulfric. He's our leader - the leader of the Stormcloaks.
Perhaps. At least it will continue to exist. Grik los lein.
I am glad you believe that. At least it will continue to exist. Grik los lein.
And, as you told me once, the next world will have to take care of itself. Ful nii los. Even I cannot see past Time's ending.
Even I cannot see past Time's ending to what comes next. Niid koraav zeim dinoksetiid. We must do the best we can with this world.
Please, stop wasting my time. You're embarrassing yourself.
Really? That seems hard to believe. You're sure about that?
Results speak volumes over words and you've just proved it.
Did you happen to discover where the fetcher was getting his skooma from?
It's nice to receive good news for a change. Did you recover anything else from the warehouse worth mentioning?
Rumor has it they can get you anything for the right price.
There's pirates and then there's the crew of the Red Wave. They're in a class by themselves.
They usually make runs along the coast shipping all sorts of contraband to and from Morrowind.
Save me a lot of trouble. Here. Take it to the Blue Palace.
Show up these Imperials for the foreigners they really are.
You're right. Let Tullius be the one to insult the Greybeards by refusing their summons.
Hmm. We could use the time to bring in new recruits. Our losses have been heavy recently...
He is weak. And no doubt knows it. He's no fool, he'll come, if only to give his troops a chance to refit.
But you're right. Victory is within our grasp. We can afford to give the Empire one more chance to withdraw.
Sibbi's been spreading lies about me, you must hear me out.
Please, I beg you, don't tell Sibbi where I am. He'll kill me!
Someone was attacked in the market. Do you know who it was?
Yeah, but she was a Nord. And a noble. Perfect Forsworn target.
You're being paranoid. We're in control of Markarth. Not the Forsworn.
I think it was Margret. Poor woman, she was just visiting the city from Cyrodiil.
Spoken like a true Nord. I'll stand beside you, Dragonborn.
No Nord could have said it better! I'll stand beside you, Dragonborn.
Take a look around. Have you ever laid eyes on such wealth?
Never. This is the best the Guild's done since I've been a part of it.
Thank Mara. I was afraid I'd never be able to convince you.
Allow me to gather the materials I need for my ritual, and then I will meet you outside the ruins.
That's what this lesson is for. Perfect time to try it out.
The gate's unlocked. You can head inside when you're ready.
There are wonders in this place I never dreamed imaginable.
Aye, but I'll be here in Solitude for longer still. Fihada's skill as a fletcher drew me to this place. I wanted to learn.
And far to the west lies a ruin. Volskygge. Inside, there is said to be a wall, black as night. And it speaks! In the ancient Dragon tongue!
And there is still much of Skyrim I wish to see. I hear there is a city, Wind-Helm, that is nearly white with... What do you call it? Ah yes! Snow.
Well then you'd better have something I really want to buy.
Well, perhaps that is why you're merely an Apprentice here.
Well, thank you for bringing it I suppose. Have a good day.
Ah, Bolli finally got someone out here. Well it's about time. I've been waiting for weeks.
What, what is this? Is this what he really thinks about me?
From Faendal? That's strange. He's never written to me before.
Well, you can tell that... that long-eared ass not to come around the store anymore. He's not welcome.
What? That flower-chewer's died? Then let me out. My tower!
Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job, lad.
Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job, lass.
I've smoothed things over with her for now, but you can forget your cut.
You've made a mess of things and Maven's furious. I told you not to burn more than three of the hives!
Yes, my lord. Summon me again, and I shall have your stone.
Yes, my mistress. Summon me again, and I shall have your stone.
Yes, of course! But how to force a dragon to talk to you...
There is one possibility. But... no, the Jarl would never agree.
Yes, yes. My staff, take it. Kill something pretty with it.
You understand? They left me for dead. I didn't leave them.
What? You see a man fallen on hard times, and you think he's been like that forever?
I was there. I fought in the Great War. I was on the field at Anvil. And when I was struck down, they left me.
You've returned. Good. What did you find at Wolfskull Cave?
Your path now follows his, though you will arrive too late.
Indeed. And so you have come looking, though you do not know why.
Like others before you, you blindly follow a path to your own destruction.
The Thalmor came seeking answers as well, unaware they will be his undoing.
Aduri, how come the fields haven't been tilled like I asked?
All right, I understand. I'll do it tomorrow, okay? Just get off my back.
Because it's boring. The fields are going to do fine... you don't have to dote over them so much.
Boring? That food is paying for everything. If we lose even a single crop, we could starve or be forced to beg. I won't have it!
Ah ha! So you're a student of theoretical applied harmonics!
Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent or allow it to generate its own field?
Putting aside Ralston's Constant of Universal Inversion for a moment, how would you approach the problem?
Ah, yes. Well, I'll be sure and stop by the Arcanaeum later.
All that talent will go to waste when I'm finished with her.
She was a young woman... buxom, with long flowing black hair.
She used to sing the most lovely songs to me when we were courting. I've never heard a voice so beautiful.
And lose out just when the going is getting good? No thanks.
If you like I'd be happy to take it over the operation for you. Take the source off your hands.
I just got lucky is all. Bumped into someone who knew someone else. The rest just writes itself.
I don't know where you find your sources, but that last shipment of skooma was some of the best quality I've seen in years.
As far as Goldenglow Estate goes, I'll tell you what I know.
Not at all. I consider it an investment in prolonging my life.
As was destined, you are free to use my Star as you see fit.
My Star has been restored and Malyn's soul has been consigned to Oblivion. You have done well, mortal.
Because big, bad Brynjolf doesn't like the way I play thief.
Now I'm sitting in here counting skeever droppings while he's drinking Black-Briar mead with Maven.
Look, he says we needed coin, so I got coin. Who cares if people got hurt? Blood washes off septims.
Bolli is a good man, he pays us well and watches out for us.
It's probably for the best anyway; I'm far better at fishing than working in a meadery.
I used to work at the Black-Briar Meadery, but Indaryn and I never saw eye-to-eye. That elf has no patience at all.
But this is only a small part of their power. Zofaas suleyk.
Hmm. How to explain in your tongue? The dov have words for such things that joorre do not.
The Kelle... Elder Scrolls, as you name them, they have often been used for prophecy. Yes, your prophecy comes from an Elder Scroll.
It is an... artifact from outside time. It does not exist, but it has always existed. Rah wahlaan. They are...hmm... fragments of creation.
Could it really be?  Wow this is what I've been looking for.
Did you see that madman? A Forsworn agent. Here in the city.
Do you agree to be bound together, in love, now and forever?
Don't want in, huh? Fine. Have a good walk to the next city.
Dragons, thieves and war. I should have stayed in Morrowind.
Watch yourself out there or they'll take everything away from you.
The Ratway is somewhere under Riften, shouldn't be too tough to find.
Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us, boy.
Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us, girl.
Fine. If you can't pay with coin, you'll pay with your life!
For the privilege of entering the city. What does it matter?
Fort Hraagstad is one of the few that remains mostly intact.
The ancients built many of the fortresses that dot the landscape of Skyrim.
Sadly, most have fallen into disrepair. And nearly all have been overrun with bandits or other vagabonds.
We're going to install a garrison there, but first, your going to clean out the bandits that have moved in.
Gianna will be overjoyed to meet you. She's in the kitchens.
Stop right there. The tower is off limits until further notice.
Go on ahead. I'll be sure and catch up with you before long.
This bears closer inspection. I'd like to stay a while and examine this.
I've never seen anything like this in Nordic ruins before. Why, just look at all these coffins!
You, however, should press on. See if you can find whatever this vision of yours mentioned. But if it is truly dangerous, be careful.
Good news. I found that dwarven hammer you were looking for.
You did? Thanks. I get you the rest of your coin by tomorrow.
Yeah, funny thing about that. The price was a hundred higher than I expected.
Vekel, you have no shame. I'll get you the rest like I said. I want that hammer.
Great! Thanks! Bastard stole from me. I'll catch him though!
He won't say a word to me, but I don't know how I upset him.
Yes, my youngest son. He's a dark child. I don't know what to do with him.
If you could speak to him. Draw out the truth. I would be immensely grateful.
He was always a quiet lad, but lately... something has changed. He's become brooding. Violent.
Here, your reward as promised. You have Winterhold's thanks.
Can you believe that this hold used to contend for the throne of the High King? Now perhaps others will listen.
Here's your shiv. Promise you won't ever use it on me, okay?
Hmm, it's encrypted.  It'll take a while to figure this out.
How long have you been in Skyrim? Yes. Give the man my axe.
If he returns it to you it means we have business to settle. If he keeps it, then we are at peace.
I believe this gem is worth more than you are at the moment.
I would not sell it to just anyone but I'll make an exception for you. The cost to replace the gem is quite high.
I have Alva to take care of now. I don't need Helgi anymore.
I hear your crops sold well at the market. Well done, Ennis.
I'm trying something new, offering discounts for bulk purchases. So far, that seems to be working.
I know who you are. You've been terrorizing the entire city.
You... you have my statue! What are you going to do with it?
What does he want now? I already explained to him that you can't get blood from a stone.
Please, there's no need for that here. Message understood. Here, I even have the payment!
I knew when we were married, this would come between us one day. I don't want to lose what we have, so I'll pay him gladly.
I'm going to examine the body before the rats can get to it.
If you want to help, ask some of these gawkers if they saw anything useful.
In the mountains to the northeast. I'll mark it on your map.
It is when my customers waste time chatting, and not buying.
You'd think so, wouldn't you? I'm fine. Thank you for asking.
Only when you're around. The rest of these fools I could do without.
It's a blessing given to the most honored of the Companions.
Come on now, you're a sharp one. You must have heard of werewolves before.
It's a blessing given to some of us. We can be like wild beasts. Fearsome.
Just please, don't harm anyone. I couldn't bear the thought.
Look, I'm only telling you this because I care for her. Don't mistake this as acceptance for what you do.
Keerava has some family at a farm just inside of Morrowind. If you mention you know about it, she might just listen to you.
Karliah and I had a long discussion before you arrived here.
As a result, we both feel that you have the potential of replacing Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild.
As a result, we both feel that you'd make an excellent replacement for Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild.
Thanks to your efforts, the Guild's been restored to it's full strength and you've exposed the traitor in our midst.
Thanks to your efforts, Mercer's treachery has been exposed. After we deal with him, all that remains is restoring the Guild to its full strength.
Let's get up there before mother finds out what we're doing.
Maybe I'll hold off and go another day. Get some rest first.
Money, you laggard! What else? It always comes down to coin.
We've got the same pride, the same honor, and we've got wealth. No wonder they envy us.
The Gray-Manes have deep roots in Whiterun, but so do we. Difference is, we're rich, and Vignar hates it.
Oh, and they hate it, too. All their big talk of pride and honor, and what have they got to show for it? Beggar's rags and stale bread.
My darling, you've made me the happiest woman in all Skyrim.
My sweet Leanora, I will never let anything happen to us. I promise.
It brings me joy to hear that, but what possessed you to say that so suddenly?
I've already lost a family, and we're about to start a new one. I don't want that to happen again.
My family thanks you. Take this as a token of our gratitude.
My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone.
Were I able to provide it, I'd shower you in wealth for what you've done.
No, I'm not. Looks like we've got something in common, then.
Hmph. No, friend, that I'm not. But I get along with your kind well enough.
Ha! And neither are you, eh? Good to see another Redguard. I like to think we bring a little heat to this frozen wasteland.
Not much. But as a bard, I find the whole affair depressing.
There are no heroes in this war. No winners to be had and no real conclusion.
There are no heroes in this war. Even with Ulfric here in Solitude, there are no winners to be had. No real conclusion.
Of course not! Thieves take what is precious. Thieves steal.
We just take what will not be missed. What no one needs anymore. Maybe we take some weapons and stop a few deaths. Who would call that thievery?
One of them's escaped, and you're going to find that coward.
Perhaps, but abuse is abuse. I don't think I could stand it.
If you'll pardon the expression, she's far more bark than bite.
There's much more to worry about in life then a bit of a temper, my friend.
I heard Temba yelling at you yesterday. Why do you let her treat you like that?
Please, I need help! I don't want to die on this damned log!
Please, visit me at my home. I can tell you the whole story.
I just... I just know it. I can feel it in my heart. You have to believe me.
She's our only child, Boti. Am I to throw her to the wolves?
You have to let Fastred follow her heart. You can't tell her what to do.
And if she decides to leave Ivarstead, what then? No, no... I can't bear the thought.
You're hardly throwing her to the wolves. She just wants to see the world... just like I did when I was her age.
Since the Stormcloaks took over, Jarl Thongvor is in charge.
That would be Jarl Igmund. Young for a ruler of a Hold, especially the Reach.
It'll be lean times for the Reach with a Silver-Blood ruling it, that's for certain.
Wasn't surprising he stayed loyal to the Empire. His father helped capture Ulfric Stormcloak after the Markarth Incident.
So, I've been hearing your name in court quite a bit lately.
Ah, there you are. I was wondering when you'd visit us again.
I've been informed by my steward that you've made quite an impression in the Rift; the people won't stop blathering about you.
I've been informed by my steward that you've made quite an impression in the Rift; several of our citizens have expressed their admiration.
Someone's got to head out there and take care of the beasts.
It seems that predators have taken up residence and have been attacking farmers and travelers.
Somewhere in the ice fields, if you want to try to find him.
Oh no. I hope not. But even I haven't seen him in years, and we were close.
Became obsessed with the Dwemer. Took off north saying he had found some old artifact. Haven't seen him since.
Sssssh! That's not something we want everyone to be hearing.
Let's just not take the chance. We can talk about this later.
Oh, like the sleepy rebel supporters in this town are going to tell anyone.
Did I tell you I got a letter from General Tullius? They've conscripted some more archers and will need...
Thank Her Benevolence it wasn't burned like the other tomes.
Thank the gods. I'll get to work on the Phial straight away.
Thank you for this. I have a great deal of work ahead of me.
Wonderful. I was afraid I'd have to give up, and when I'm so close...
That's what I've spent my twilight years trying to find out.
They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force.
And now I've found the answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and only their magic can release us.
And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity.
I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in  the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild.
That's what you did, isn't it? Absorbed that dragon's power?
In the very oldest tales, back from when there still were dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal their power.
This is why so few follow it, and why the world is as it is.
Those who are ignorant find the Way of the Voice easy to ridicule.
Those green apples you sold me the other day were delicious.
You're right. I'll have to remember that the next time I get a shipment in.
I'm sure you could charge double for those and still sell them all within a week.
Aren't they? I always set some aside for myself when the traders bring them up from the south.
We are honored to have you as Thane of our city, Dragonborn.
By my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. It's the greatest honor that's within my power to grant.
I assign you Lydia as a personal Housecarl, and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now would we?
We are used to the cycle of gain and loss. It is no trouble.
What are you gawking at? Can't you see I have problems here?
Yeah? Well, I got news for you; there's nothing to see here.
Last thing the Black-Briars need is some stranger stickin' their nose where it doesn't belong.
Yes, just a brief overview of our facilities. Are you ready?
Another new student... I'm surprised at how many of you there are lately.
I'll give you a brief tour, and then we'll get you to your first class. Are you ready to begin?
Well, first you'll need these. While you're not required to wear them, you may find them more to your liking than your current clothes.
Yes. He was an absolute genius when it came to the nirnroot.
Sinderion made it his life's work, developing all sorts of interesting concoctions.
You're here! I was beginning to think you might not make it.
You're leaving? Okay, we'll just work on the verse in a bit.
Ah yes, Sarthis... a thorn in my side for the last few years.
Yes, I'm afraid we're aware of Sarthis's presence in the warehouse.
However, if you'd take care of this discreetly, you might be able to surprise him without warning.
However, if you'd wish to eliminate that burden for me... well, let's just say it would go a long way with earning my favor.
Unfortunately, we're certain he has informants within the city guard. Every time we've made a move to arrest him, he's escaped.
I've tried repeatedly to eradicate that meddler, but he has ears within the city guard. Gives us the slip every time we raid the warehouse.
And obviously you have Ulfric, the Jarl and future High King.
The clans Shatter-Shield and Cruel-Sea see most of the gold that passes through the city.
There's an author named Adonato staying at the inn. He's published a few works of historical fiction.
Oh, and that busybody Viola Giordano. She's got her nose in everyone's business, which I guess is one way of being prominent.
And so, perhaps, your destiny will be fulfilled. Who can say?
Alduin believes that he will prevail, with good reason. Rok mul.
Dez motmahus. Even to the dov, who ride the currents of Time, destiny is elusive.
And he is no fool. Ni mey, rinik gut nol. Far from it. He began as the wisest and most far-seeing of us all.
And why would I... Oh. Oh! Guards! Guards, I need assistance!
Are you sure? I doubt you stand a chance against the Thalmor.
I can have a group of men ready at a moment's notice. Many would be willing to help rescue my brother.
Are you... threatening me? Walk away fool. It's not worth it.
As always, lord, your loyalty is a shining example to us all.
Melaran, you lazy milk drinker, have you finished studying the imports from Black Marsh?
Right you are, elf! Or even from the rebels, if they've got enough money to make a competitive offer.
Even a fine weapon is only as good as its wielder, sir. But they should fetch a high price from the Imperial army.
Scary, thinking of those boots with an army of Elven weapons at their command. Let's be thankful they're half a world away, eh?
Indeed I have, sir. Elven weapons for their armies, sir. Elven material, but poor workmanship, like most of what we get from them.
At last. It is over. Perhaps it was all worth it, in the end.
Aye, and some of what Karliah said is starting to make sense.
Old Delvin kept calling it a curse and we all laughed at him. Looks like the joke's on us.
Mercer may have damaged our reputation and raided our coffers, but this goes well beyond even his twisted form of larceny.
Because getting rid of the Empire was only half the problem.
Soon, the elves will again seek to rule the world. We must ready ourselves to fight them.
It's only a matter of time before their pointy ears start itching to rule the world again.
The ordinary citizen will be happy to get back to life as normal, to have their families return home.
Peace? When has any Nord ever known peace? Skyrim breeds warriors. It's who we are, it's in our blood.
And that's as it should be. In the darkest days ahead, it'll be us Nords who lead the fight against the elves.
The fiercest of the remaining rebels will continue to harass us, but by in large, the people here desire peace.
For it will be Skyrim that shall lead Tamriel in those dark days, when the fate of the world is finally determined.
What I'm not so sure about is the peace we've made with the Thalmor. But we'll keep that between the two of us, alright?
And they should enjoy it while they can... I suspect all of Tamriel will again be called to arms in the not too distant future.
It'll be Skyrim that leads the charge. Mark my words. And that time around, mankind will either succeed once and for all or die trying.
There will be peace for a time, during which we must rebuild Skyrim into the land it once was. Strong. Self-reliant. The center of mankind.
There are those who still call themselves Stormcloaks, who continue to fight us, and bring misery to the people... but they are few in number.
But nothing a band of Stormcloaks can't handle, I assure you.
Curses notwithstanding, the tombs of kings are always full of traps to ward off grave robbers, are they not?
Aye. The Great Hunt killed old King Borgas. Gods only know with what profane arts those elves cursed his remains.
Does it look like I can move? You have to cut me down, first.
Don't go talking about that. Only the dinner guests can know.
Shh. You mustn't speak about such things away from the shrine. Only you and your dinner guests can know.
Better if we don't talk about that. As far as anyone's concerned, we all had dinner at a nice inn along the road, and nothing strange happened.
Don't sound so eager, it's not a social visit. It's business.
Dragons aren't just coming back, they're coming back to life.
Now something's happening to bring them back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.
They weren't gone somewhere for all these years. They were dead, killed off centuries ago by my predecessors.
Dumping bodies and keeping the guards quiet can be expensive.
Are you daft? I told you not kill any of them. How much clearer do you need me to be?
So, job's done and you even brought the gold. Best of all you did it clean. I like that.
How about the gold? Did you remember to bring it or is that too difficult an instruction as well.
Exactly. For the Guild to survive, they need Maven's support.
This Karliah must have spent a lot of time and resources planning this.
Fine, then. I guess some Dunmer are content to be their pets.
Don't you ever find it demeaning, working for that Nord family?
Look, Ambarys, I just came here for a drink. I don't need any trouble.
Here's what's going to happen. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, and you're going to leave me alone. Deal?
Good. And you'll have a chance to prove it to me soon enough.
Have you considered that Alduin was not meant to be defeated?
If the world is meant to end, so be it. Let it end and be reborn.
What I want is irrelevant. This Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again.
Those who overthrew him in ancient times only postponed the day of reckoning, they did not stop it.
I didn't mean to imply I was earning an honest living either.
With my lock picking aptitude, I was a natural at jailbreaking... made a great deal of gold doing it too.
I hope you're not expecting to get paid until the job's done.
Oh really? And I don't suppose you'd just do it out of the kindness of your heart, would you?
I just cook, and clean, and do whatever it is they ask of me.
Now, then. I been gabbin' long enough. Too much cleanin' to do.
What? You dare challenge Ma'randru-jo? You will suffer for your insolence!
What? Why? I don't understand... I have done nothing to wrong you. Please, mercy!
I can't even keep track of all the people who have been in and out of this fort. They come, they go. I barely notice.
I remember one morning, long time ago, I woke up and the place was run by some Orcs. Went to bed that night, it was all vampires. Don't matter to me.
Hard enough to keep up with who owns this fort. One side takes over, the other runs away. I tell them, [QUOTE]I ain't leaving! I come with the place![QUOTE] Ha!
I knew, that day, that it was truly the beginning of the end.
30th of Frostfall, 171. Thirty years ago. The Great War started that day.
We heard the news at Cloud Ruler by courier, riding hard from the Imperial City.
It was a cold day. The end of Frostfall is nearly winter in the Jerall Mountains.
The Thalmor ambassador delivered his ultimatum to the Emperor Titus Mede: the heads of every Blades agent within the Aldmeri Dominion.
I simply must have this! I'll pay you double what it's worth.
Excellent. Very good. This is exactly what I need to complete a series of studies I'm doing on Dwemer craftsmanship and magical resonance.
I told you to go away. I'm not opening this door for anybody!
I'll bring you everything we have on them, but it's not much.
So don't get your hopes up. It's mostly lies, leavened with rumor and conjecture.
I'm afraid I have absolutely no idea what you're speaking of.
Now, just a moment. Let's think about this... you know, discuss it like two rational people.
I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone.
And I... I can't bear to face Nocturnal after my failure to protect the Key.
Brynjolf is needed back at the Thieves Guild to keep order while you're away.
I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for this. Move along.
If this place is in danger ever again, the shadows will call.
Should the need arise, a portal connects the Sepulcher and Nightingale Hall. Use it whenever you wish.
If you don't find him soon, he'll return, stronger than ever!
He must have returned to Sovngarde to feed on the souls of the dead.
In the meantime, I'll see about figuring out what went wrong.
I'm not really sure. I think it's just a minor miscalculation on my part.
I'm sure it will wear off soon. When it does, you'll be perfectly fine, and then we can try again.
It's all here. Well, congratulations. You're one of us again.
Next time you decide to pull a stunt like that again, just remember how much it hurt to give this away.
It's an old family. Very well-respected throughout the Reach.
The Silver-Bloods run nearly all the lands in this Hold, as well as the local inn.
And of course, they own Cidhna Mine, the finest prison and source of silver in Skyrim.
It's my wife, Fjola!  I think she's being held in this tower.
It's quite fetching actually. The craftsmanship is excellent.
It's through these subtle means that Nocturnal influences us.
Again, you have to think differently. Haven't you ever noticed how our luck behaves?
Like a novice picking an impossible lock or a blind man suddenly turning to face you as you reach for his pocket?
Knowing a Word of Power is to take its meaning into yourself.
Contemplate the meaning of a Rotmulaag. You will become closer to that Word, as it fills your inner self.
Will I teach you, Dovahkiin? What Word calls you to deeper understanding? There are three to master: Fus, Feim, and Yol.
Look silly! As if you could look any sillier than you do now.
Look, I don't think I should say. I mean, they could kill me!
Makes Narfi very, very sad. Narfi needs Reyda to say goodbye.
With father I said goodbye... with mother I said goodbye. Reyda leaves and Narfi can't say goodbye.
My problem with her? She's the one who has a problem with me!
She's trying to undermine my confidence, make me doubt myself. Well it won't work, I tell you!
She's threatened by me! By my skill as a wizard, by my elegance and posture, by my superior good looks!
But she's not going to get the better of me, oh no. I won't let it get to me one bit. That's what she's after.
Narri! This mead tastes like water and the meat has gone off.
We had this same argument every week, even when you were Jarl.
The impertinence! You never would have talked to me like that when I was Jarl.
The mead is same as it ever was and the meat is fresh, maybe your sense of taste has [QUOTE]gone off.[QUOTE]
Necromancy, as any other type of magic, is a tool to be used.
Of course, non-mages may not see it that way, so we don't go around flaunting it.
By Sheor, no. Those archaic policies died out with the Mages Guild, and were never enforced here.
New in town? You're lucky. Dreams aren't affecting travelers.
Well, until they do, I don't have any business to discuss with outsiders.
That priest of Mara who came here before you says the Divines will cure us.
You haven't heard? All of Dawnstar hasn't had a decent night's rest in days.
I hear there's a priest of Mara visiting the inn. Maybe the Divines will cure us.
Nightmares. I haven't met a single man or woman who doesn't admit to having them.
It's these nightmares. Me and every one of my workers can't catch a nod without having one.
That's right. Dawnstar. My Dawnstar is plagued with nightmares. I haven't slept properly in days.
Everyone here is having nightmares. I have miners tripping over their own feet from lack of sleep.
A bad dream I can handle, but everyone having the same bad dream, every night? It's a curse, I say.
People are having nightmares they swear are real. They go to bed, but they wake up more tired than yesterday.
Everyone else though.... They're horrible. Imagine dying over and over again in your dreams night after night.
They're almost... real. They say a priest of Mara has arrived in town. We'll see if faith can cure this curse.
I heard there was a Priest of Mara who was supposed to be looking into it. We'll see if anything comes of that.
If people aren't tired, they're angry, and if they aren't angry, they're afraid. It's made keeping order a mess.
I hear Mara has sent one of her priests to the inn to try to calm people down, but I don't know how much words will do now.
They say a priest of Mara is visiting the Windpeak Inn. Says the Divines will take care of everything. We'll see about that.
I've heard that a priest of Mara has come, saying that the Divines will lift this curse somehow, but that remains to be seen.
Not a single man or woman in Dawnstar has gotten a good night's rest in days. We keep having the same nightmare, over and over.
No you're not. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?
Now that they've been dealt with, we need to find the Torpor.
Of course. That's your choice. I just wanted to let you know.
Oh, yes. All the time. They come with the visions, as always.
How are the headaches, dear? You or your mother still having them?
Well dear, you know where to find me if it ever becomes too much for you.
Oh no! I couldn't. Mother says they are a burden we must bear for our gift.
Are you sure you don't want something for them? I may be able to brew you something to help.
Perhaps you could spare a tomato for a priest of the Divines?
Perhaps if I were a little more blessed I could afford to give away my fruit. As is you'll have to pay, Rorlund.
Raerek, how is The Reach faring against this Forsworn menace?
The safety of the city and our settlements must be our only concern, Igmund. The rest of the Reach is on its own.
This is why I say we take the fight to them. Gather the Legion and drive those blasted beasts out of the Reach for good.
Cowards, the both of you. My father would not sit idly back and wait while evil men take over his lands. We're done discussing this for now.
Things are bad, Igmund. Our forces are barely able to keep the Forsworn in check. Merchants are reporting the loss of more of their shipments.
And what do Legion soldiers know about the hills the Reach? And the caves that make up those hills? The Forsworn can hide and ambush every assault.
Ranmir beg a drink from you, yet? That's gold wasted, friend.
Take my advice. Never gamble. Damn Irnskar has me in debt up to the eyes.
Poor Roggi. If you're feeling charitable, buy the Nord a mead. He's good for it.
Life's hard enough with all these men propositioning me. But that bard is the worst.
We're used to getting by on scraps, but the Shatter-Shields want everything for nothing.
Secret, though. Official Synod business. Can't talk about it.
It was a brilliant idea, really. Mostly mine, though Gavros took the credit.
Seemed like the best way to see the world and make some coin.
Sure I'm a little green, but what I lack in experience, I make up for in courage.
Seems friendly enough. Obviously intelligent. Why do you ask?
Think of him? He's an odd little man. Always poking around the ruins and wasting time in his museum.
Some other time? That's not going to help me much, now is it?
Spices? I'm certain I have no idea what you're talking about.
You sure? It was in your handwriting. If you can't keep the books straight then let me do them.
Drifa? I was looking through our books and there's an entry for [QUOTE]spices.[QUOTE] Says we spent 300 septims. What is that?
Oh, yes... spices. That was a special order for someone in Whiterun. Should be along any day now. Don't let it worry you, my dear.
Steel your nerves. The draugr are gone. Focus on your mining.
I feel like any moment, a draugr is going to come and chop my head off.
Svari, yes. It's been hard on her. The girl misses her uncle.
I've tried to explain that Roggvir did something bad and that we all have to be accountable for our actions but... a child feels what she will.
Tell him to finish the preparations, the Festival is back on.
I need you to go speak to Jorn. He was preparing the Effigy of King Olaf.
Soon, soon. These things must be done properly, you will be inducted as part of the Festival itself.
Thank you. When I find my daughter, it will be thanks to you.
That pig? Oh, I have info on him. More than you care to know.
That thing's evil, Lynly! I told you to keep away from there!
I think I saw it again. That... ghost. It was over by the barrows.
See that you don't. I promised to keep you safe and I'm not going to break my word.
I'm sorry. I was curious... I didn't believe the stories. I won't go over there ever again.
The cemetery is ancient. It's been here longer than the town.
I'm no scholar, but I know that a lot of battles have been fought here over the course of history.
After each battle, more dead were buried, and the graveyard got bigger. I've heard it's now the biggest graveyard in Skyrim.
The Legion could really use someone like you, especially now.
You'll want to talk to Legate Rikke. She deals with the new recruits.
I'll be sure to put in a good word for you if I get back to Solitude first.
And if the rebels have themselves a dragon, General Tullius is the only one who can stop them.
General Tullius has his headquarters in Castle Dour, in the city of Solitude, northwest of here.
Of course! I know, today wasn't the best introduction to the Legion, but I hope you'll give us another chance.
The life of adventure and song is the life for us, eh friend?
Ah, smell that fresh air? Truly, this is a good place to play a song.
Hello there, friend. How lucky for you to chance upon a bard on the road.
Hello there fellow, traveler. One itinerant minstrel and wandering wastrel, at your service.
Then I swoop in and take over the place. No more competition.
Exactly. With Sabjorn in prison, his meadery will be forced to close.
They say a dragon attacked Helgen. Sounds like hogwash to me.
Word is Ulfric Stormcloak escaped from the Imperials. War's only going to get worse, now.
We've got something of a love triangle here in Riverwood. Faendal and Sven, both vying for Camilla's affections.
Those Thalmor are elves, too. I bet they're working together.
Maybe I should round up some men and take us a few prisoners to interrogate.
Wouldn't surprise me. They've done nothing to help in the fight for Skyrim's freedom.
Ulfric Stromcloak's head rolling away from his lifeless body.
Skyrim being sold to the Thalmor so the Emperor could keep his throne!
We're fighting because Skyrim needs heroes, and there's no one else but us.
I hope Ulfric will come to his senses. But I fear he's in too far to stop now.
We're fighting because we're done bleeding for an Empire that won't bleed for us.
Untold numbers of Nords died defending the Empire against the Dominion. And for what?
We're fighting because our own Jarls, once strong, wise men, have become fearful and blind to their people's suffering.
Likely only Ulfric's death, or the overthrow of the Jarls supporting him will end this. Either way, much blood will be spilt.
First we'll kick the Thalmor and their bloody Imperial puppets out of the country. Then we'll rebuild Skyrim into the land she once was.
When we are done with that, we will take our army to the Dominion, and show those pointy-eared bastards not every man is fit to be their slave.
Welcome. I'm the owner and proprietor of Honningbrew Meadery.
If you want to buy something, go find Sabjorn. Otherwise, piss off.
If you're looking to purchase any mead, speak to the owner, Sabjorn.
We may be small, but what we lack in size we make up for in quality.
I've never met someone like him that revels so much in other's misery.
If you're looking to purchase any mead, speak to the brewmaster, Mallus.
To tell you the truth, Sabjorn isn't much of an owner. Slave driver, sure.
You need something to do, or you just enjoy slowing down the hard-working folk?
If you need to sample some of the finest mead in Skyrim, you're in the right place.
Honningbrew uses only the finest natural honey, not that sludge you'll find at Goldenglow Estate.
Black-Briar Mead is just fine, if you need something to wash the dirt off a riding horse's hooves.
It's a shame the Black-Briar Meadery took this place over. I never liked it as much as our Honningbrew.
Mallus is teaching me everything he knows about brewing. Hopefully, I can take over his position some day.
We're a small meadery, but growing quickly. Sabjorn's only been running this place for a short time now and look at it.
Well come back when you do, my friend. Come back when you do.
Well done. I wasn't certain you'd even know what to look for.
Well, ain't gonna find her here. Haven't seen her in a while.
What do you want now? You still hurling baseless accusations?
Why would anyone want to kill her? It doesn't make any sense.
She's a traveler, from the Imperial City. Came by every day looking for jewelry for her relatives back home.
No. She's such a nice woman. Comes by every day looking for jewelry for her family in Cyrodiil. Is it because she's a noble?
Yes, I'm going with you and together we're going to kill her.
Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.
Here's your payment for Solitude. Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.
You can go back and forth all you want, he just needs to pay.
You might try there, if you can get through the Ratway alive.
Huh. Lot of old guys around. I don't really know how I can help.
You're not the first person to come in here asking about him, either, so be careful.
That's interesting. Why do I care? You want a drink, or maybe just a few broken bones?
He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Be careful. You're not the only one looking for him.
Never heard of anybody like that. But if you want to hide out in Riften, the Ratway's where you'd be.
Down in the Ratway Warrens. Nice place, if you don't mind the stench, rats, and assorted lowlifes as neighbors.
Lot of people looking for him. Don't know his name, but he's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here.
Don't know his name, but there is a guy like that hiding out down here. Paid plenty for nobody to know about it.
Well... there is guy like that. He's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here, but I guess I can tell you.
Yeah, I think I know who you mean. He's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here, but I guess I can tell you.
There's a sort of tavern down there, the Ragged Flagon. Where all the lowlifes in Riften get drunk and knife each other.
You should leave. I don't want you scaring off my good death.
You'll come of age soon. Time to be married to another chief.
I won't be married to some weak-willed Orc chieften. I'd sooner join the Legion.
You're the one who put out the fire in the Lighthouse, right?
And he's not just any dragon. He was the right hand of Alduin.
He committed atrocities so infamous they are still remembered, thousands of years later.
It's true that his crimes are long in the past, but justice does not count the passage of years.
That's fine. We needed his help. Now we don't, and it's long past time for him to pay for his crimes.
All well and good. But did you know that he was Alduin's chief lieutenant in ancient times? Responsible for terrible atrocities?
And if the meadery is profitable, I get rich. Get the picture?
Ever since I took over as the foreman the production of our mead has never been more profitable.
Maven Black-Briar wants me to keep the mead flowing and that's what I aim to do despite all these lazy good-for-nothings that work for us.
Another girl killed. This is Susanna, from Candlehearth Hall.
Served me a drink just a few nights ago... but I can't say I knew her.
Another poem, I'll bet. He does know how to make a girl blush.
You can tell Sven that he already has a mother. I'm not speaking to him anymore.
What's this? If that oaf thinks all I'm going to do is stay in that filthy house of his and clean, I'll....
At last... the final Totem is ours. Let's go complete our set.
That's it! That's the second Totem. Quickly, let's put it back with the other one.
That definitely matches the description of the totem from Skjor's old book. Let's get it to the Underforge.
Can't do that and keep an eye on things here at the same time.
But... You could take word to her in Solitude, let her know it'll be coming soon.
I'd make it worth your while. No one would notice a few missing ingots out of the next shipment.
Do not delay. Alduin will be coming. He cannot miss the signs.
Go then. Fulfill your destiny. Take the Scroll to the Time-Wound.
You have it. The Kel - the Elder Scroll. Tiid kreh... qalos. Time shudders at its touch.
There is no question. You are doom-driven. Kogaan Akatosh. The very bones of the earth are at your disposal.
Do not delay. Alduin must feel the tremors in Time by the Scroll's presence here. He will know what it means.
Do you have any family? Anyone waiting for you on the outside?
Don't worry, it will all be waiting for you when you get back.
Just make sure you get back out of there alive with the information we need.
Fine, but there's a whole crypt of draugr underneath the mine.
We're not going in there until the Jarl's men come to clear them out, so I wouldn't go down there.
Go now, the artifact must be reclaimed and Malkoran destroyed.
Ha! Clearly, we should have killed that old bastard years ago!
Hadvar's alive? I hope that's true. He's a damn good soldier.
In the meantime, why don't you have a chat with Legate Rikke.
But he hasn't reported in yet, so he can't exactly confirm your story.
He knew everything about the ancient dragonlore of the Blades.
You mean, aside from wanting to kill every Blade they can lay their hands on?
Esbern was one of the Blades archivists, back before the Thalmor smashed us during the Great War.
Obsessed with it, really. Nobody paid much attention back then. I guess he wasn't as crazy as we all thought.
He's not a werewolf any more? Even dead? This is a good thing!
And that's exactly what the old man wanted. I'm glad we could give it to him.
Yes, you brought honor to him, even after his death. A worthy outcome for a worthy warrior.
Hemming, have you dispatched that letter I gave you yesterday?
Yes, and I sent it with our fastest courier and under the cover of night, exactly as you specified.
I'm almost certain he'll reach the Imperial City tomorrow, so we should have an answer by the end of the week.
Good. If I need to light a few fires in order to get what we need to defend this place from the Stormcloaks, so be it.
Hmm. Very well. I'm putting my reputation on the line for you.
This is neither the time nor place for such things. I'm surprised you would ask it of me.
How did you get it? No, never mind, I probably shouldn't know.
Try to find out where their fortress is. The captain, Stig Salt-Plank, has to know something.
I see... it looks like Suvaris has been traveling to Dawnstar to meet with a pirate crew there.
Get to Dawnstar and see what you can find out about these rogues. I'd wager they won't be too far from the tavern.
How does a knife in the gut sound? It's 200 gold or your life.
Eh, fine. I can tell you aren't worth the trouble. Just get out of here before I change my mind.
I could also do some good for a change. Sure, I'd go with you.
I doubt the Empire has the stomach for much more bloodletting.
Good. We still hold half of Skyrim despite everything the Empire could throw at us.
Good. They've had their victories, but Tullius is no fool. The Empire can't afford to keep this up much longer.
Good. Maybe he's realized he's beaten. The way things are going, we'll be knocking at the gates of Solitude itself before too long.
I inherited the store from my husband. His father was Arnleif.
My husband, Gunnar, died about five years ago. Forsworn attack. I miss that stubborn oaf.
I said [QUOTE]a free meat pie[QUOTE]. As in one. Here's yours.
I suppose so. I just fear they won't make it out here in time.
I'm not so sure the few guards they've assigned to the farm are enough.
Just worry about keeping the fields tended and let the Jarl worry about the war.
It will have to do. Besides, if it came to blows, I'm sure the Snow-Shod's would come out here and assist us.
I suppose there's no point in concealing the truth any longer.
My knowledge of this temple comes from personal experience. I was a priest of Vaermina.
I understand your hesitation, but I promise you that it works.
Dawnstar's fate rests in that tiny bottle. The longer we wait, the more damage Vaermina could be doing to those poor people.
I'm a Forsworn. One of our raids went bad, and I got captured.
Would've been fine dying for the Reach with my kinsmen, but the Silver-Bloods want their ore mined, so they threw me in here.
I'm not sure. Just... Well, mind what you tell him, all right?
If it puts your mind at ease, I'll take it with me. I'm sorry.
Husband, you worry far too much. We are within an hour's walk of Riften.
Synda... you left your dagger behind again yesterday. I told you, the road isn't safe.
That doesn't matter. All it would take is a stray wolf or a bandit crossing your path... I can't bare to lose you after everything we've done.
If you want something a bard can dig into look to the dragons.
A thousand years from now Skyrim will have changed rulers dozens of times but the return of the dragons, that story is once in an era.
Luckily for you, I've already made the mixture. Here, take it.
It's buried with its maker, Curalmil, in a long forsaken cave to the west of here.
Please... don't dally. I've wasted enough time arguing with my useless assistant here.
You would do that? It's good to know there are some people out there who are willing to help an old man.
Curalmil was a crafty one, even in death. You would need the skills of a master alchemist to reach his resting place.
New sister. May I offer my most sincere welcome to our Family.
New brother. May I offer my most sincere welcome to our Family.
Well, well. It's raw meat. Oh, my beautiful wife has told me all about you.
Welcome, my sister. Welcome to our Sanctuary. You have made the right choice, joining us, I assure you.
Welcome, my brother. Welcome to our Sanctuary. You have made the right choice, joining us, I assure you.
There you are! Astrid's told me all about you. Heard she pulled the ole' [QUOTE]Choose your victim[QUOTE] gag with you. Ah, I love that one...
Yes, yes, you're the new Family member. Let's make this easy - consider me the cranky old uncle nobody talks to. You go your way, I'll go mine.
No, he means to ambush us down here, I'm almost certain of it.
I've learned to trust her lead at this point. After all, we Nightingales need to stick together, eh?
For someone in possession of the Skeleton Key, stealing the Eyes of the Falmer would be child's play.
Mercer's been careful so far. I don't think he'd just leave those plans behind unless he had his reasons.
The lass seems to think old Mercer is pulling a fast one on us... leading us here and letting the dwarven constructs wear us down.
Not just the men. The Greybeards seem to think the same thing.
Now, empty your pockets or I'll pick the gold off your corpse.
Brynjolf's been sending idiots like you down here for years looking for their hideout.
Funny thing is his stupid Thieves Guild never counted on me and my partner blocking the way.
Oh, no. Nothing like that. You're calling on her for business.
Okay! Let's play hide and seek. You find me and I'll tell you.
That's cheating. We're playing hide and seek. You have to find me before Laelette does.
We have to wait for nighttime though. The other one is playing too, and she can't come out until then.
One more reason to pray for the fighting to end then, my love.
Falk, you shouldn't have come. You know what'd happen if people found out about us.
I know, my lady. I just needed to see you outside of court, away from all of the politics.
You're right, of course. But when this war is over, I'll gladly resign and we can stop sneaking around like this.
I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you helping the Jarl, Solitude would be weaker.
I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you, he'd have the Jarl bent around his little finger.
Seriously, you don't know? That was Ulfric Stormcloak himself.
Stop! We know you're holding a Daedric artifact. Hand it over.
Thanks. It would be nice to have it back... means a lot to me.
That, and a true Nord never misses a chance to test her worth.
The heat of battle is the fire that forges the strongest blades. It's an old Nord proverb.
That's all right. Return to me if you change your mind though.
That's all! I'm a nobody, really. So can't you just let me go?
None of your damned business who I am! If you're going to kill me, just do it already!
Ahhh... Vasha, at your service. Obtainer of goods, taker of lives, and defiler of daughters.
As Mara is my witness, if I didn't have this hood on right now I would spit right in your face...
Have you not heard of me? Perhaps I will have my people carve my name in your corpse, as a reminder.
My name is Fultheim. I'm a soldier. Well, mercenary, really. You know, a... a sellsword. I've lived in Skyrim all my life.
That's between you and Maven and I prefer to keep it that way.
Just keep your ears open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine.
Don't worry about it. Maven's business dealings usually involve quite a bit of gold for her people.
The dagger...? By Akatosh, they didn't even wrap it correctly?
The ice entombs the heart. The bane of Kagrenac and Dagoth Ur.
To harness it is to know. The fundaments. The Dwemer lockbox hides it from me.
The Elder Scroll gives insight deeper than the deep ones, though. To bring about the opening.
They laughed at me again, Dinya. They simply don't understand.
You're a good man, Maramal. We're lucky to have you watching over us.
I'm so sorry my husband. You must remember, they're at the Bee and Barb to drink, not to listen to a sermon.
Yes, yes, I know. I just wish to show them there's more to life than drowning your sorrows in a goblet of mead.
Unless you've come to pay a ransom, turn around and walk away.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Bear pelts.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Wolf pelts.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Ice Wolf pelts.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Cave Bear pelts.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Sabre Cat pelts.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Snow Bear pelts.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Snow Sabre Cat pelts.
Well met, Brand-Shei. I've come by to browse your wares today.
Good. Maybe that will teach them to leave honest citizens alone.
Is it true you chased a thief from your home? I overheard Aerin mentioning it.
It's true. Wasn't much of a thief though. Made enough noise to wake the Red Mountain.
Well, boy, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint.
Well, girl, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint.
What if I told you about a large shipment of gold and weapons?
What if I told you about a large shipment of silver and weapons?
Where? I would never... ah, I see. You are a fellow enchanter.
Wish to converse with the crazy old elf, eh? Very well. Go on.
Yamarz has demanded we stay inside the walls. We cannot leave.
I must petition Malacath for relief. This curse must be lifted.
But I cannot travel to Malacath's shrine. The ritual must be done here, and I do not have the materials I need.
I beg of you, can you bring me Troll Fat and a Daedra Heart? I have no wish to depend on a stranger, but I have no choice.
Yamarz is proud, and refuses to see that we need outside help.
Our chief is weakened. He will not rest, will not sleep. He suffers, and so the tribe suffers.
He needs someone to confide in. If it will not be one of us, perhaps it will be you. Go to him.
Yes, you were going to demonstrate your ability, were you not?
And thus, you're not skilled enough to be a candidate. I'm afraid we're not interested.
Those invested in Restoration magic find Healing Hands to be essential. Can you cast it on me? That would prove your skill.
The Flame Atronach is a vital companion for anyone relying on Conjuration. Summoning one here would certainly show your skill.
The Mage Light spell is useful to any mage, not just those specializing in Alteration. Can you cast one on the seal on the ground?
A standard spell for one skilled in Destruction magic is the Firebolt. Casting one at the seal on the ground here would be sufficient.
The Fear spell has saved the life of many an Illusion mage. If you could cast it on the seal here on the ground, that would prove your skill.
Unfortunately, one needs to be able to cast at least Apprentice level spells in any school of magic before being allowed to join the College.
It would seem that you have yet to reach a level of skill that the College would find valuable, so I'm afraid I can't allow you to join at this time.
Yes. I earned the right by slaying my father in single combat.
Until then, I alone have the right to have wives and children. It ensures our strength.
One day, I will have a son who will challenge me when I become too old to lead, and the stronghold will have a new chief.
You have returned. Will you now aid me in contacting Malacath?
Forgive Ugor's harsh words. She is merely doing as she has been told.
You're right. Tullius isn't in any position to ask for Riften.
Yes. With Markarth in our hands, we'll be able to raid the Imperial supply lines out of Solitude...
It has its advantages. I've never liked having the Empire perched on my doorstep. And Riften would be easy to hold...
You're wrong! Sibbi and I are in love and you're just jealous!
No! I'm saving myself for someone special. Someone who loves me dearly.
It's only a bit of fun. You're a lovely young thing, you should try it sometime.
Aunt Haelga, why you... demean yourself with these people you barely know? They show no real love for you.
You mean Sibbi? You must be joking! All he wants to do is bed you and be done with it. You may as well get it over with and let him.
Your corpse will feed my spiders for weeks. Now die, you fool!

Ah, freedom. Now get out of my way. I have a task to attend to.
Ah, well I guess it was unlikely. I'm sorry to waste your time.
All at once! You're efficient. I like that. Here's your reward.
And I've figured out where the next one will come back to life.
I know they are. I've visited their ancient burial mounds and found them empty.
We're going to go there, and you're going to kill that dragon. If we succeed, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Are you so sure of that? I think Birna might disagree with you.
As long as he keeps paying, I suppose. He keeps to himself, and isn't hurting anyone.
How long are we going to let Ranmir drink himself into a stupor? When will enough be enough?
It's not my place to get involved in their family's business, remember? You're the one that told me to stay out of it.
As a consequence, I have no knowledge of what you'll be facing.
It wasn't created for the Nightingales. It was created to test those who wished to serve Nocturnal in other ways.
Astrid... By the sands, I still can't wrap my head around it...
Bah. Another honest man lost in all this madness. And for what?
Really should talk to Mulush if you have a problem with one of the workers.
The Forsworn? That's right. I'll say it. We all knew. Even that fat-headed, slave-driving Mulush knew. Just ask him about it.
Beyond that I seek only to be left alone to pursue my research.
I keep to myself. I offer spells and scrolls to those who need them, and wisdom in Conjuration magic for those who wish to learn.
But I have nothing to hide. I'm in from the south, on business.
You must be new around here. Bad manners to ask such a direct question, at one of Elenwen's little soirees.
And if you want to do business in Tamriel these days, well, you'd better get used to cozying up to the Thalmor. Like it or not.
Come along, no more stops, we need to find our way to Solitude.
Why are we even going to a wedding at this far flung end of the Empire anyway?
Hopefully these gifts will put us in her good graces, secure that import deal, and lead the way to an audience with the Emperor.
I told you, it's the wedding of Vittoria Vici, an extremely well connected merchant with the East Empire Company. The Emperor's cousin? Remember?
Easy there. The numbness will pass. Just don't strain yourself.
We've done it. The Star has been cut off from Azura, and Malyn's soul finally has some measure of peace, even if it is in non-existence.
Enjoying the hospitalities of the inn. Suggest you do the same.
I like to spend time up here. Walk the Steps, meditate on the emblems. Doesn't hurt when I bag some game along the way.
I'm walking the 7,000 Steps to honor the Greybeards and reflect on my own life. It's a tradition among the Nords of Skyrim.
Good job. Here, let me give you something for all the leg work.
Good, I'll contact some of my people and have them prepare some shipments right away.
Good. No killing, though. Don't get arrested. I won't help you.
No funerals, just some pain. If you get caught, it's not my problem.
Make it hurt. But not too much. No killing. And don't let the guards catch you.
Make it quick, but make it hurt. If you get caught by the guards, I don't know you.
No killing. I'm not hiring the Dark Brotherhood, here. If you get caught, it's not my problem.
It should hurt. A lot. But I'm not paying for murder. Oh, if you're caught, it's not my problem.
Hurt him. I mean her. Whichever. No killing though. And I ain't paying your fine if you get caught.
Just cause some pain. I don't want a death on my conscience. If you get caught, it's not my problem.
Good. Now remember - pain, and lots of it. But not to the death. If they arrest you, it's not my problem.
I hope I can hear the screams. But don't let on it's from me! And I'm not paying your fine if you get caught.
Good. Then I think it's time we put your expertise to the test.
Have you talked to Brelas yet? I'm not a patient man, you know.
Did you see that serving girl? I hear elf women are insatiable...
Elenwen always throws quite a party. I never miss one if I can help it.
For the man who knows how to make money, war can be a most profitable venture.
The Great War is long past. It's time the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion put aside their differences. Prosperity is good for everyone.
Hmm... Yes, the silence suits you. Gives you an air of mystery.
Now, down to business. I'm arranging a job for you. But in the meantime, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over.
How could I forget? That old alpha male almost took off my leg.
Never did find out why they came sprawling into town like that.
Thoring, do you remember the time when that wolf pack come clamoring into town?
Animals in the Pale don't need a reason to attack Dawnstar. It's just their nature.
How could you forget? It was the sweetest story I'd ever heard.
You met at the full moon, under the biggest tree in Witchmist Grove, surrounded by fireflies. It was straight out of a storybook.
Hrmph. Breaking a curse is not a simple thing. It is dangerous.
But... To have won against Malacath himself... That would be seen as real power.
I am charged with protecting the Jarl from any and all threats.
Powerful men have many enemies. More so, in times of strife. So you can imagine the dangers.
Oh yes, there have been attempts on the Jarl's life. More than one would-be assassin has met his end at the tip of my blade.
I certainly hope so. I don't know how long we can keep this up.
At least tell me where you're going, so we can send someone after you if you don't come back.
I found out the Thalmor have him. And they don't let anyone go.
He knew what he was getting into. I don't... I don't blame anyone.
Between the two of us, his family is better off thinking he's dead.
I wish everyone could just get past that and get on with their lives.
It's been a while now. I miss him, but it's clear he's not coming back.
He fought on the wrong side, and he paid for it. That's all I have to say.
Oh come on, leave it alone. He's gone. There's no use in talking about it anymore.
Best not to ask too many questions about it. People might get the wrong idea about you.
What's there to say? You go against the Empire, you wind up dead. Thorald got what was coming to him.
Thorald and I have history, all right? We used to be friends. So I looked into it when he disappeared.
So I've kept my mouth shut. Like I said, his family is better off believing he's gone, because he's never coming back.
I'd wager old Vignar could see half a dozen of my predecessors.
You see only me because your heart knows only me as the Companions leader.
And I see them all. The ones in Sovngarde. The ones trapped with me in Hircine's realm.
And they all see you. You've brought honor to the name of the Companions. We won't soon forget it.
I'm sorry. I don't think I can bare to sell anything right now.
Is there anything more revolting than spiders? Too many legs...
It was the only way I could make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap.
Mulush, we need a break. The heat from the smelter is too much.
Are you complaining? Work. If you have strength to whine, you have strength to smelt.
My note? No, that's yours. Must have fallen out of your pocket.
No, and after what you've discovered I fear the worst for them.
None. It's been long enough that honestly, I don't expect to hear from them.
Now, what's this nonsense about trapping a dragon in my palace?
Of course. But I can't just hand that over. Privacy, after all.
Or else what? You'll kill me? I already had to face that today.
Private quarters are strictly off limits. You have been warned.
Put the thought out of your mind, and do not speak of it again.
Control yourself! Do not frighten away our customers with your fits.
My bones ache for the moonsugar. It has been too long since I tasted it.
My ears hear the truth in your words, and yet my body shakes with the need.
Yes, of course you are right. Still, I would give much for even a few grains of moonsugar.
You know that our supply is limited. It could be a season or more before we get a new shipment from the south.
Revenge is it? Have you learned nothing from your time with us?
When will you open your eyes and realize how little my actions differ from yours?  Both of us lie, cheat and steal to further our own end.
Sadly, we never had the opportunity to speak about the details.
Besides the fact that there are only a handful of people in Tamriel that even recognize the language?
I'm fairly certain he was planning some sort of a heist that involved a deep understanding of the Falmer language.
Skyforge Steel is all the Companions will use, for good reason.
The Skyforge? Aye, my clan-fathers have worked it since the first Gray-Manes came to Whiterun.
So that's how it's going to be, huh? Fine. Take your best shot!
Some of these Nords will come up with any excuse to despise us.
In fact, just about anyone who isn't a Nord is fair game for their bullying.
And it isn't just the dark elves they hate -- they make a target of the Argonians as well.
Stop, outlander. You must pay for your crimes in blood or gold.
You've broken the Code of Malacath. Your choice - pay with your blood or your gold.
Tell me, do you believe in mighty Arkay, god of life and death?
Thank you! I can promise you that this will be put to good use.
That's right. Home of the Redguards. The land of sand and seas.
I hope one day I'll convince Rustleif to take us back there. Until then, I'm content running the forge together here in Dawnstar.
The catch is that you can't burn the whole place to the ground.
That important client Mercer mentioned would be furious if you did.
The Empire is in shambles. They've banned the worship of Talos.
I may have roots in Cyrodiil, but Skyrim's as much my home as any Nord's.
I'm on my way to Windhelm to join up with the Stormcloaks. Ulfric has the right of it.
These fights are invite only. And you're not invited. Slag off.
Think maybe we should jump the guards when they come down next?
They keep the doors locked when they come down. You kill them, you're trapping us here with no food.
Ugh. That insufferable pup? Forget it. Request denied. No deal.
Well... perhaps there is a way he could earn his place back at my side. Maybe. But no promises.
I'm glad to be rid of him. Even if it does mean I'm stuck in this pitiful shrine, in the back end of... nowhere.
We should get after Vals Veran before he does more damage here.
Whatever it is those Psijics are up to. They cannot be trusted.
For all we know, he's here to scout out the College. I'm sure they want to undermine our efforts.
Yes. The oldest and most powerful, although he may not seem so.
I doubt he's forgiven me for leaving. And for... well, for what he'd consider blasphemy. Using Shouts for anything but worship of Kynareth.
You would do that? That's great. You should go do it right now.
You're right. Ulfric isn't in any position to ask for Markarth.
It's true that Whiterun is dangerously exposed as long as the Stormcloaks hold Markarth...
Hmm. The Rift would help secure our communications with Cyrodiil... and threaten Ulfric's southern flank...
You've done it! The College is safe again, thanks to your work.
Here, consider these yours. And the Arch-Mage's quarters as well. I shall be here for advice, should you need me.
I knew you had it in you. I daresay the Psijics are right. There's no one more deserving to be Arch-Mage, in my opinion.
A family of thieves. Running their corrupt empire from Markarth.
The Silver-Blood family own half the Reach, and they won't stop until they own all of it.
Always such a model for decency in these troubled times, Yngvar.
Shut it, Kleppr. Thongvor isn't here, so save your kissing up for a Nord who cares.
Ah, Yngvar, here to sing? You know an employee of the Silver-Blood family is always a guest of honor here.
An Elder Scroll is an instrument of immense knowledge and power.
Even so, the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price.
To read an Elder Scroll, a person must have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness.
I knew it. Everyone comes in here, expecting my help, but they don't even have the proper questions.
And here you are. I hope you've found the museum to your liking.
And when the coin dried up, that's when people started to leave.
It wasn't long before we lost what we depend on to survive... respect.
We had the best of everything down here... the Ratway was a damn palace.
Are you kidding me? Ever since the Guild's luck turned sour, we haven't had a coin to our name.
The only way this place will ever return to its glory days is if we can finish these extra jobs and start the gold flowing again.
By doin' these extra jobs and puttin' some fear into the people, we can take back the cities and start bein' taken seriously once again.
Years ago, the Guild used to have a foothold in every major city in Skyrim. You wouldn't dare even lift an apple without checkin' with us.
When things started goin' downhill around here, it became difficult to keep it all together. We lost fences, influential contacts and coin.
As for honor, well, there are some luxuries even I can't afford.
Not every Nord is obsessed with strength, honor and skill at arms.
A rare few are born with a gift for making money. My investments are my strength and my wealth is my weapon.
Aye, the last thing we want to be doing is crossing our clients.
Because Tolfdir says so. He says there are things to learn here.
Not really. Just that it's very, very old. It was one of the first cities of men in Tamriel, I think.
Hopefully we can learn something from the experience. How the ancient Nords used magic, maybe even what happened to this place.
Besides, you're the one having all of these visions, aren't you?
I've got to stay here, to see if we can get to Ancano and stop this. I need someone I can trust to do it.
Brynjolf's been looking for you about the Guild Master ceremony.
Brynjolf's looking for you. Something about becoming the Guild Master.
Brynjolf told me he was looking for you about the Guild Master ceremony.
Guild Master, huh? Well, guess we could do worse. Better go see Brynjolf about it.
So, they're making you leader, huh? Better go find Brynjolf so he can seal the deal.
Did you know Brynjolf was looking for you? I think it's about the Guild Master ceremony.
I heard Brynjolf is looking for you. I think it's time for the Guild to have a new leader.
Brynjolf tells me you'll make an excellent Guild Master. Oh, he's looking for you, by the way.
So, they're making you Guild Master, eh? Good. Just find Brynjolf and he can make it official.
Brynjolf's been looking for you. He wants to discuss the Guild Master ceremony. Congratulations... boss.
So, you're finally going to make Guild Master, eh? Well, you better track down Brynjolf to seal the deal.
I think it's time we make this Guild Master thing official. Go and talk to Brynjolf, he's makin' preparations.
I heard Brynjolf wants to see you about being Guild Master. I suppose my turn will come one day, but for now you'll do nicely.
What are you doing talking to me? Didn't you know Brynjolf's been trying to find you? It's time to install you as Guild Master!
By all I hold holy... Can it be true? Have you actually done it?
This is a great day, my friend. You have struck a blow against darkness that will not soon be forgotten! Here, as promised - a most generous reward!
Damn him - the old bear was right! Did you run into any trouble?
Exactly. Together we stand more of a chance of making this work.
Make your way to Northwatch Keep in Haafingar. I'll meet you near there, and we'll plan our assault.
Excellent. You've done us a great service. Here is your reward.
Here. Take a look at this. Some of the Jarl's men came by and left this bounty letter.
Good. After I open the gate, please stand on the western circle.
Great.  Here you go. Come back later and I'll have other things.
Hey, when you make up your mind, just let me know. I'll be here.
I can't, Valindor. It won't let me go. It's taking over my life.
It's an evil substance. Whoever's selling it to you should be brought to justice.
If there was any justice in the world, I'd just get this over with and die peacefully.
Wujeeta, you really need to stop using that skooma. It's very bad for your health and I wouldn't want to see anything happen to you.
I don't know how you made it this far, but you'll go no farther.
I haven't seen him in many years. I wonder what became of him...
I had quite the mentor. He taught me everything he know about the nirnroot and its strange properties.
I knew we could count on you! Glad to have you back on our side.
At long last. An ancient evil is avenged. The shades of many Blades salute you this day.
I may consider it. But you must first do a service for my glory.
I used to fence for the Thieves Guild in Skyrim a long time ago.
When Linwe moved into the area, he contacted me and said if I didn't fence for them, he'd kill me.
I want to be an adventurer like you, but my father says I can't.
His name's Mralki, and he's the innkeeper here. I hope you can change his mind.
He says that he needs me to stay here and work the farm, and even if he did let me be an adventurer, we couldn't afford to buy armor.
I'm afraid your skills haven't improved enough to be considered.
I'm Captain Aldis. I'm here to help you take down these bandits.
I'm not a scholar, Esbern. How many times do I have to tell you?
Well, I'm [QUOTE]not a scholar[QUOTE] of architecture. And that's that.
The architecture of this temple is marvelous. Have you ever seen stonework like this, Delphine?
Nonsense. Is a child who learns to read [QUOTE]not a scholar[QUOTE] of literature? Is a smith's apprentice [QUOTE]not a scholar[QUOTE] of blacksmithing?
I've had enough troubles recently. What is it that you're after?
I've scraped this collection together by whatever means I could.
A few intrepid souls even brought some items back from Morvunskar, the fort southwest of the city.
I do some business with the trade caravans, and I've picked up a number of items from adventurers like yourself.
If that's all, there's pressing concerns that need dealing with.
If you say so. If this were anyone but you I would lock them up.
Take it. Take the coat, have your fun. I'll see you at the festival.
If you want to help, you'll need something to cut into it first.
In fact, there is. I need a soul gem filled, if you're up to it.
It flew over the town and landed on the old dragon burial mound.
Kynareth gives life, and we need a living tree to be her symbol.
A big dead tree isn't very inspiring if you're coming to worship the divine of wind and rains.
Like I said in my note, I've heard that you might be Dragonborn.
Mara's mercy, then he's safe! Come on, we have a lot to discuss.
What? You left him on his own? With the Thalmor after him? Go make sure he's safe and bring him here!
Nice to finally meet someone who can follow simple instructions.
Here's your reward, as promised. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to work.
No, the dragons are merely the final portent of the End of Days.
Dragons, pah. They can be killed. The Blades killed many in their early days as dragon-slayers.
Oh, yes! Quite! So many important people from all across Skyrim.
Our daughter. Our little girl. She hadn't seen her tenth winter.
Prisoners smuggle the stuff in. Only currency we have down here.
Bottles of Moon Sugar. Khajiit use it as a... pick me up. Good way to pass the time.
Really? You're certainly... forthright about your criminal past.
But it's none of my concern who the Imperials want to execute. Especially now. What I want to know is what exactly happened at Helgen.
Rescue? No one knew where I was, when I was taken. Who sent you?
Return when you've defeated the guardian wolf, crab and skeever.
I'll anoint you with the symbol of the wolf, the crab and the skeever. This will compel the guardian to appear when you reach his lair.
She finally decided to return it to her father. Bless her heart.
I will make sure this finds its way to his tomb as soon as possible. Thank you for bringing it, my child.
She wouldn't have to be there at all, if it weren't for Roggvir.
Perhaps, but necessary. As you know my cousin, Fura, died out there fighting for us. She wouldn't have had to, if it weren't for Roggvir.
Perhaps, but necessary. My cousin, Fura, is somewhere out there in Skyrim right now, fighting Ulfric Stormcloak and his damned insurrectionists.
Since you're still alive, I assume you have good news to report?
So, what's your heart's desire? What kind of deal can we strike?
By all means, let's hear it. It's the least I could do, since you already helped me grant one final wish for my last worshippers...
They were suffering so from vampirism, and begged me for a cure. Then you came and ended their misery! I couldn't have planned it better myself.
Some say murdered, but it was a lawful challenge in the old way.
If Torygg couldn't defend his throne, he had no business being High King.
Ulfric called him out as a traitor to Skyrim, and killed him in single combat.
Thanks for the offer, Jouane, but I'm saving up for a new sword.
Anything I can pick up for you on my next trip into the city, Erik?
That was suspiciously nice of her. I thought she hated everyone.
Really? How did we afford that? Besides, I like the gown I already have.
She does, my lady. But apparently, she hates you just a little less than the others.
My lady, I'm pleased to inform you that you have a new gown for court, specially tailored by madame Endarie.
Madame Endarie insisted. She made it free of charge, in honor of your lenience about last month's rent discrepancies.
That's good news. I was starting to fear something had happened.
Then this is beyond coincidence. First Aringoth and now Sabjorn.
Someone's trying to take us down by driving a wedge between Maven and the Guild.
Try and be careful, all right? We don't want to damage anything.
I've only looked through a portion of this section. You, uh, you can look around in the chambers just north of here.
Very good. I hope this will allow us to maintain our reputation.
Wait... you mean I should just... tell her? Tell her how I feel?
Watch your tongue, stranger. We don't take backtalk in this inn.
Well, as a jailbreaker, you work alone. No Guild to back you up.
I'd do jobs for the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood, but if things didn't go as planned, I was on my own.
Yes, I know what you mean. Most Nords struggle to accept change.
Besides, the Thalmor reward their friends richly. Anyone who doesn't take advantage of that is a stubborn fool.
Those who fought the Thalmor in the Great War still see an enemy. But that war is over, and a new day has dawned.
Yes, you're innocent. As innocent as anyone can be in this city.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a mine that needs new workers to fill it.
I guess we also owe you something for locking you up. Here, my family's ring. And everything the guards confiscated from you.
Yes, you're right. I should have, but I didn't know what to say.
When the orcs raided the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters behind to die.
You should know. You got the map for me from Bleak Falls Barrow.
You think I'd abandon an opportunity to lead my Family to glory?
But this is all so much to take in. I need time to read the letter, and figure out where we go from here. And this amulet. Hmmm...
You're damn right we'll accept it. If we pull this off, the Dark Brotherhood will know a fear and respect we haven't seen in centuries.
You! You'll help me! You help people, right? That's what you do?
All right, hand over your valuables, or I'll gut you like a fish.
Hail, sister! I saw you walking there and thought you could use this.
Hail, brother! I saw you walking there and thought you might need this.
Hail, Nightingale! Luck has shined down on me and made me a rich man. Here is your cut, as promised.
All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you. Good luck!
All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you from the ridge. Good luck!
All that effort, and you just kill her. You've ruined everything.
Are you prepared, then, to help bring the light across this land?
As long as we keep Talos in our heart, his legacy will never die.
They can defile our shrine, they can arrest our people and they can silence our voices, but the Empire will never destroy our spirit.
Now that the Imperial blight has poisoned Riften, the worship of Talos is strictly forbidden by the terms of the White-Gold Concordat.
Assorted books, scrolls... I'm sure you'll find something useful.
Please make sure your hands are clean before touching anything, all right?
I have a few things laying around that weren't worth adding to the collection. You may look through them.
Be careful around here. You don't want to anger the wrong person.
Being a Jarl could hardly be simpler. You should try it sometime.
Meanwhile, my very capable steward sees to the needs of the smallfolk and ensures that my hold runs smoothly.
Difficult? I am a Jarl. I eat the most succulent meat, drink the finest ale and hunt with the best hounds in the hold.
But I'm sure you didn't come here for a lecture on high politics.
The worship of the false god Talos contributed to the unfortunate friction that led to the Great War.
Following the Great War, the White-Gold Concordat set out the terms for peaceful coexistence between the two powers.
The Empire and the Dominion agreed that the worship of Talos was a relic of the past, and must be eliminated in the interests of peace.
The Thalmor Justiciars are so often misunderstood. Our primary goal is to preserve the peace between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion.
Call it what you want. You don't pay, then you're not getting in.
All right, keep your voice down... you want everyone to hear you? I'll let you in, just let me unlock the gate.
Captain Aldis can't prove it, but that Argonian is up to no good.
Really? I knew he was mixed up in something dangerous, but I hadn't heard he was dead.
Cheers, my friend! May your adventures find you fame and fortune!
Cut me loose, minion of the Hated One. I need to get to Markarth.
So. The King of Corruption sends his messenger to challenge me. Very well.
I will meet with Molag Bal, and I will venerate his altar in Boethiah's name, as I did before.
You? A servant of the King of Corruption? Has the beast's standards fallen so far? Tell me another one.
Exactly! Now you're beginning to see how our little system works.
Maven sent word that you discovered something else while you were out there. Something important to the Guild?
Good. I'll have a sack of coin waiting for you when you get back.
That's a brave offer. I'd be happy to throw in my coin behind that.
This brings back memories. Come back when you're done and maybe I'll be up to showing you a few tricks.
You deal with them, I'll make sure you get paid. Maybe this old soldier will throw in some lessons as well.
Good. That's what I want to hear. Now go make it happen, soldier.
Have you learned nothing about me? I have dealings with everyone.
Now, leave me. I don't want to arouse suspicion by talking to someone that clearly doesn't belong here.
Have you spoken to my parents yet? Please, my love depends on it!
Here for work? Get an axe and bring me all the wood you can chop.
If it's work you need, how about chopping up some wood for the fires?
Make yourself useful and chop up some firewood. There's a few coins in it for you.
Here, take these as well, they may prove useful for your journey.
There were three of us. Myself, Gallus and Mercer. We were a anonymous splinter of the Thieves Guild in Riften.
Perhaps I'll tell you more about it later. Right now, you need to head for Winterhold with the journal and get the translation.
Hey, if you're in good with Maven you've pretty much got it made.
She's got friends in high places, and I don't just mean in Skyrim.
So getting the guards to throw me in here as a [QUOTE]punishment[QUOTE] was about as easy as falling off a log.
I almost envy you. That first time is always the most... intense.
You gave us even more trouble than Farkas did at his first turning.
I asked her the same thing and she wouldn't come out and tell me.
But now that I know who she is, I'd say she's trying to hit the Thieves Guild where it hurts.
I brought him the coin and walked away with her copy of the deed.
I was approached by a woman who wanted me to act as the broker for something big.
She flashed a bag of gold in my face and said all I had to do was pay Aringoth for the estate.
I can take a hint, lad. You want to make some coin, come find me.
I can take a hint, lass. You want to make some coin, come find me.
I don't know what we do with it now. Maybe you can figure it out.
I don't need you to teach me how to play high politics in Skyrim.
But... you're right. There's nothing to be gained by refusing the Greybeards' request.
I don't think Ulfric knew how much Torygg respected him for that.
No. Even after Istlod died, the moot voted to make Torygg High King of Skyrim.
If Ulfric had asked Torygg directly to stand up, to declare independence, Torygg might have done it.
But Ulfric was at that moot, continually talking about Skyrim's independence in terms just shy of treason.
I hope I'm wrong. I'm not sure the Empire can afford another war.
For now, perhaps. But I've heard disturbing rumors that they're marshalling their strength.
I suspect the treaty that ended the war was just a tactic to buy time so the Thalmor can rebuild their armies.
I wish she would. At least that way she'd have people to talk to.
Thanks. Papa talks about it some. Mum doesn't say much since Uncle Roggvir died. She doesn't even go to Temple anymore.
I'm feeling better, but Bashnag's curse won't wear off for weeks.
I won't be myself for some time. I just need to get out of here and recover.
Please, will you help me get out of here? If the coast is clear, I'll make a break for it.
I'm too weak right now. Between the spiders and the coven, I'd be dead before escaping the cave.
Thanks for getting me out of that. Bashnag's coven chased me out and left me for dead down here. Nobody lasts too long with the spiders.
I'm so sorry. I hope the Eight give you more peace in the future.
In a sense, but no more poisoned than a fool after too much wine.
It was Dengeir who made me a steward, long ago when he was young.
When Dengeir's health began to fail, young Sidgeir was appointed Jarl in his stead. It was simpler just to keep me as steward.
Sidgeir has no interest in running his hold, and so leaves such matters to me. As for my part, I do my best to see that folk are treated fairly.
It's a reflection of all possible futures and all possible pasts.
But at the same time, all of it is true. Even the falsehoods. Especially the falsehoods.
The simplest way to put it is [QUOTE]knowledge,[QUOTE] but there's nothing simple about an Elder Scroll.
Each reader sees different reflections through different lenses, and may come away with a very different reading.
It's okay, I know what happened at home. With the dragon and all.
It's the only thing I've even heard of that could cut Eldergleam.
The hags are hateful of anything which grows from the earth. They made the weapon strong against the natural world.
It's the only thing I've even heard of that could cut Eldergleam. Stick it in, give it a twist, and the stuff will just flow out.
Locked him up someplace to get back at my family. I'm sure of it.
The Battle-Borns. The Emperor's biggest boot-lickers here in Whiterun.
Thorald did worse. He took action against the Empire, and the Battle-Borns knew it.
It's hardly a secret that they have ties to the Empire, and hate anyone who speaks out against it.
They knew Thorald supported the Stormcloaks, knew he was going to aid them in battle. Made sure he didn't come back.
Their connections to the Empire and the Legion are well-known. When Thorald didn't return home, there was no question in my mind.
Look around you. The Flagon, the Guild... it's all fallin' apart.
A few decades ago, this place was as busy as the Imperial City. Now, you're lucky if you don't trip over a skeever instead.
Luck? I think it has more to do with the hard work and good soil.
Maybe you're right. Even so, I can't help wondering if some other force it at work here.
Looks like we're in for quite a harvest. We've had better luck with our planting than any village in the hold.
Needless to say, these rebels and I have no love for each other.
Of course they have! I've made no secret of my loyalty to the Empire. I'm no coward.
Lately, they've been threatening to send my whole family into exile if we're caught collaborating with the Empire. They think we're spies!
Twice I've been robbed, and good luck getting any kind of justice from Vignar now that he's the Jarl. He probably told the Stormcloaks to do it.
No need to bother with giants right now. Just keep your distance.
Not too much farther now. Kynesgrove is just down the road to the southeast of here.
This is Kynesgrove. Not much to look at. Let's see if we can find that dragon mound.
We'll cross to the White River and follow it to Windhelm. Then we can swing south to Kynesgrove.
This is Kynesgrove. Not much to look at. The innkeeper ought to be able to tell us if there's any dragon mound nearby.
This is notorious bandit hideout. But it's also the shortest way to Kynesgrove, so... we may have to kill a few bandits.
There's an inn at Kynesgrove - the Braidwood. I hear they serve a nice dark ale. Nothing on the Sleeping Giant, of course.
I'm glad you were willing to trust me. I know it probably wasn't the best way to introduce myself. But old habits... you know.
Not everyone, but all the Circle are. It's a secret to everybody.
Not all of us, just the members of the Circle. We shouldn't be talking about this anyway.
Oh alright.  Well I'll be here for a bit if you change your mind.
Oh... well... I can see you have no appreciation for scholarship.
Or at least, I thought I was. I don't really know what I'm doing.
Oh... hello there. Didn't notice you come up. I was focusing my magicka.
Please. Not now. You'll know when I'm ready to discuss the issue.
Really? You're who she picked? I hope she knows what she's doing.
Riften, eh? Probably down in the Ratway, then. It's where I'd go.
Right. And what did you say the point of this little venture was?
So, Arniel. How's that little project of yours coming along? Any progress worth mentioning?
Oh, no. Err, wouldn't do to say at all. Not, err, not now. Not at all. I have far too many things to do still.
Oh, that. Err, yes. It's... It's quite promising, I believe. Definitely on the right track. Results, err, results should be soon.
Secondly, we plan on liberating a settlement from Imperial hands.
Next, I need dirt on the Jarl's Steward. Heard there's blackmail potential there.
Secondly, I need to cripple rebel production capabilities with a little sabotage.
And perhaps more importantly, I need to break one of our boys out of a rebel controlled fort.
Secondly, we got a couple of Imperial spies roaming through the hold. Need to put an end to that.
Next, I need a little investigating to confirm the possibility of blackmailing the Jarl's Steward.
Then there's a little matter of some recruiting. I have someone in mind I'd like to join our campaign.
I need to send someone out to do a little recruiting. There's someone in particular I'd like to join us.
We also have the opportunity to slay an Imperial Legate. That'll put fear and confusion into those faithless dogs.
And we understand a rebel garrison is close to abandoning the resistance. We need to send them a little encouragement.
I also would like to get a handle on what the rebels are planning - slip into their headquarters and steal their war plans.
And perhaps more importantly, we have a brother rotting in an Imperial prison. He won't languish in there long, will he now?
And then there's this Orc who's been hanging around causing me headaches. Something about a vision quest he needs help with.
And we hear a handful of Imperials are realizing they are Stormcloaks at heart. We need to send them a little encouragement.
And then there's a tiny problem with a giant attacking our supply caravans. A giant! As if I didn't have enough to deal with.
And then, it seems an Imperial worm wiggles it's way back home, carrying information stolen from us. We need to steal it back.
Soldiers win wars, but where to put them is the key. We have word of an enemy courier in the area. We aim to confiscate his documents.
Secondly, we're mounting an attack on the Fort. I want to gain a fortified position here before we launch our final attack on the capital.
Also, I need a peek inside Imperial headquarters, ideally lifting some documents detailing their plans. I need to know what to concentrate on.
And we have an opportunity to slay the rebel field commander. Without a clear command structure, they should fall into confusion and disarray.
And as if that wasn't enough. I got this damn Orc hanging around, getting in the way, yapping about needing help with some kind of vision quest.
And then there's a tiny problem with a giant that's been raiding our supply caravans... You heard me right. A giant. Need to put a stop to that.
Next problem - Imperial thieves have, yet again, stolen an important resource.  So we're gonna take it from them permanently - by destroying it.
Secondly, some rebel scouts that have seen too much are moving through the hold. Need to take them out before they report back to their leaders.
Secondly, I want to take the fort here. Having a fortified position will make it easier for us to amass men for our ultimate attack on the capital.
Secondly, we got more of 'em hiding in a village, using the local populace as shields. Not to worry. We can dispatch them without harming the locals.
Something about placing it back in Yngol's chamber, I don't know.
What was I thinking? Even if it were true, I'm not setting foot in some ancient tomb, filled with who knows what.
Some line about this claw thing and Yngol Barrow. He said it was worth more than its weight in gold if I took it back there.
The fool's my husband. I'm Fjola - or I was, once. Don't you see?
I left that old scab. Came home to Skyrim, and found this rabble of bandits.
The Greybeards tend not to get out much, if you catch my meaning.
Mostly food supplies like dried fish and salted meats; you know, things that keep fresh for a long time.
The one who stole it has fled to what he thinks is his sanctuary.
Just as a bear climbs a tree to escape the hunt, but only ends up trapping himself.
Seek out this rogue shifter. Tear the skin from his body, and make it an offering to me.
The only way to bring it back will be through the Pilgrim's Path.
When the Skeleton Key was stolen from the Twilight Sepulcher, our access to the inner sanctum was removed.
The sort of embellishment wizards of ancient times loved to make.
I'm not really sure. Made and used by Magnus himself, if you believe those sorts of things.
I believe I've heard it said that it's the only thing that could adequately contain his power.
The witches didn't lie, of course. But it's more than our bodies.
Then find one. That dung heap Grisvar's been known to make a few.
All right, head on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach is smarter than you think.
Then it is done at last. Perhaps it was all worth it, in the end.
There may be a matter in which your... skills... could be useful.
The various points of focus for magic energies around the College have become polluted, and need cleansing.
The magical energies underneath the College still require purification. Your assistance would be most useful.
There's just one more target before we strike out at the Emperor.
Have you by chance heard of the [QUOTE]Gourmet[QUOTE]? Read his cookbook? It's become quite a phenomenon.
Festus has been spearheading this part of the assassination plan. He's close to uncovering the identity of the Gourmet. You should report to him.
The Gourmet is scheduled to cook for the Emperor at a special dinner. You'll kill him, steal his Writ of Passage, and assume the roll of master chef.
There's one way to find out. Try to Shout... that would prove it.
Well, you can Shout now. You couldn't before, right? That can only mean one thing. You must be Dragonborn.
This one would try a shop. You might prefer the direct route, hm?
Deathbell grow in the frozen tundra. You might nip into a mine for the ruby and silver. Vampire Dust is tricky. Vampires, you know.
Ulfric showed up at the gates of Solitude requesting an audience.
We thought he was here to ask Torygg to declare independence. By the time we realized Ulfric was here to challenge Torygg... it was already too late.
Unfortunately for you, we don't allow men into the inner sanctum.
Unfortunately for you, we don't allow the uninitiated into the inner sanctum.
Very well, but when their emissary arrives I want words with him.
Why have taxes not come in from Granite Hill, Nenya? We should send some guards down there.
They are only a little late, Jarl. The trade routes are affected by the war, we should give them another day.
Very well. He seems like a fighter to me. I'll give him the oath.
Very well. She seems like a fighter to me. I'll give her the oath.
Very well. I'll do the oath later. Let's just get 'em geared up and ready to fight.
Wasn't long before I saw more of the world than I bargained for.
My parents were traveling merchants eventually settling in Cyrodiil. I must have inherited their wanderlust...
I joined the Legion to see the world. I know, that's one of those things people say, but it's completely true in my case.
Well then, let's get started. I've got three available right now.
When you've completed all those, we'll see if I might have some more.
Your targets are the beggar Narfi, an ex-miller named Ennodius Papius, and Beitild, a mine boss.
Well uh, Endon is a silversmith in Markarth, so I just assumed...
Whatever the case may be, her intentions are far from benevolent.
Who can say? Perhaps she collects them for display like works of art in a nonsensical art gallery.
Why don't they listen to me, Keerava? Why won't they do as I say?
Maybe they're afraid of you. Maybe it's your breath. How should I know?
They always try to take advantage of me. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile.
I'll tell you one thing, if you don't make peace with them soon you may get a walkout on your hands. Then we're both in trouble.
Wuunferth? Bah. It's purely ceremonial, and he has no use for it.
Besides, I wouldn't want to be the one to give it to him. Gives me the creeps. They say he dabbles in necromancy.
You can't go to a party at the Thalmor Embassy dressed like that.
Have you given Malborn the gear you want to smuggle into the embassy?
You have shown that you are Dragonborn. You have the inborn gift.
But do you have the discipline and temperament to follow the path laid out for you? That remains to be seen.
You want Thonar Silver-Blood. He handles all the family business.
If you're here to talk politics, though, you'd want his brother Thongvor. He spends most of his time in Understone Keep.
Your sigil stone. Lord Dagon is... less than pleased at its loss.
Aela will be joining us shortly. Once she's inside, we can follow.
All that remains is to ensure the safe return of the Skeleton Key.
I can't believe it's over. Twenty-five years in exile and just like that, it's done.
All that remains of the infamous cult, I've gathered in my museum.
They were worshippers of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Lord of Destruction and Change.
The Mythic Dawn killed Uriel Septim VII and his heirs, triggering the events that lead to the Oblivion Crisis, when the Daedra invaded Tamriel.
Although I suppose a little mead now and then would be harmless...
If it wasn't for skooma, I'd already be on my way out of this horrible city.
All my gold... completely gone. Now I have to start over. I'll never use skooma again!
Are you prepared to join your spirit with the beast world, friend?
Are you ready to enter the Star and purge the soul of Malyn Varen?
But war is war. Right? Nobody could blame me for that. Could they?
Please! I don't know! I mean, I'm a soldier. I've killed people. When I was ordered to. Maybe there were some times... some times I got carried away?
Come to think of it, I know of a win-win situation for both of us.
As much as I hate to say it, you're almost as powerful as I am right now. But that's just because half of my power resides in that mutt, Barbas.
Don't worry, I'll treat those shipments as if I owned them myself.
I'm telling you, Vulwulf, it's the investment you've been waiting for.
So I pay for the weapon shipments and you oversee their distribution to the Stormcloaks?
Shor's Beard! You're right! I'll do it... provided you supervise the shipments personally.
Exactly. What better way to help the cause than to put weapons into the hands of young Nord warriors dying for their homeland?
From the moment I arrived here, I've felt myself... well... dying.
Nothing would bring me more pride than to return the Key, but I'm afraid it's impossible.
Gallus's Oath has been paid. His actions have satisfied the terms.
Now his spirit becomes one with the Evergloam... the realm of perpetual twilight and the cradle of shadow.
Gulum-Ei is our inside man at the East Empire Company in Solitude.
I'm betting he acted as a go-between for the sale of Goldenglow Estate and that he can finger our buyer.
Get out there, shake him down and see what you come up with. Talk to Brynjolf before you leave if you have any questions.
Ha! Tough talk for someone who's about to have their guts spilled.
You know, now that I think of it, that sounds fair. Just shove off before the others notice.
Hardly worth giving up Markarth for, but not a bad starting point.
Not quite worth handing over Riften, but not a bad starting point.
He just couldn't accept that. And now he'll have to pay the price.
Look, the Dark Brotherhood is a family. This Sanctuary is a family. And, we've always welcomed those... shunned by society.
Werewolves, wizards, eternal ten year-old vampires... what does it matter? In truth, I've rarely met a lunatic I haven't liked.
Cicero's problem isn't his madness. It's an adherence to an ancient, outmoded way of life. The Night Mother's ways... simply are not our ways.
Here, take this as a bit of a reward for nabbing our little thief.
That fetcher! I gave him the same keg just this morning and told him to store it in the cellars.
Oh, he'll rot in prison for this one I promise you. As soon as Maven finds out, it's all over for him.
I couldn't. It would dishonor the place the chief has made for me.
I do. There is a freedom the roads give you that the stronghold does not.
But I have a place here, and I wouldn't want to dishonor my clan by leaving again like some young pup.
I couldn't. It would shame my chief and my mother and foremothers.
It is our way, and I am proud to follow my people's traditions, but I can't help but feel chained.
Yes, but I must stay here and wait for the day when I'll be married and sent to another stronghold.
I don't have time for your foolishness. Either help me or be gone.
I guess it's all over. I expected... I don't know what I expected.
Roggvir always talked about his honor. Seems to me honorable men don't get executed.
I know I did. But how was I to know the shipment would get robbed?
Next time, keep your plans quieter and nothing would have happened to it.
What? Are you telling me you robbed it? Why? Why are you doing this to me?
Look, Shadr. Last warning. Pay up or else. All I care about is the gold. Everything else is your problem.
I'm really getting tired of your excuses. When you borrowed the money, you said you'd pay it back on time and for double the usual fee.
I studied with them when I was young. They taught me how to Shout.
I swear upon Lady Mara that I would never let any harm befall you.
No, all my research points in the opposite direction. This is the exact liquid the priests would drink.
The only question in my mind is whether you will be granted The Dreamstride. Otherwise, the worst that could happen is a bad aftertaste.
I wish to cleanse myself that I might know glory in the afterlife.
I want to be clean, like he was, and go to Sovngarde when I finally die.
I think that maybe Kodlak was right. As a werewolf, I can't be a good Nord.
Kodlak's final teaching. I think he was right about beastblood and Sovngarde.
I wish you luck, but should leave here while I still have my skin.
Should our paths cross again, I will remember your kindness. Farewell.
Oh my. You would do this for me? Here, take it. I don't want anything to do with this wretched thing anymore.
Seek out the beast. He wanders these woods. Bring him down and... well, the Lord of the Hunt should smile on you.
I'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation.
We'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation.
I'll go with you, but when things are back to normal I want an explanation.
I'll send word to the strongholds to let you in as one of our own.
I'm in no position to go searching for her, but perhaps you could.
I'm not sure. I hoped that maybe if she could be found, if he had some sort of explanation, that maybe he could put himself back together.
If I only knew where he was, I'd sure give him a piece of my mind.
I waited and waited, and he never came back. Probably shacked up with some elven whore. Good riddance to him I say.
He said he was going east towards the border of Morrowind to trade some of our grain to some folks at Broken Helm Hollow.
If the Guild isn't willing to listen to reason, you might have to.
In fact, the night she disappeared, she was supposed to meet Alva.
Alva told me later that she never showed up. I never got to tell her good bye.
She began to spend a lot of time with Alva. Yet just a week before, she despised her.
Interesting, to say the least. What with all that's been going on.
All that matters is that I have what you need. And it's worth every septim.
But on the other, the scarcity of supplies has led to some, well, [QUOTE]elevated[QUOTE] prices.
On the one hand, supplies are harder to come by, since fewer traders are traveling the roads these days.
Just a pilgrim. I'd prefer to leave it at that, if you don't mind.
Just take my advice and just get out of Riften as soon as you can.
Okay, look. If I'm caught saying anything bad about the meadery or the family, I'm a dead man.
I'm the fourth person to work the tasting counter in the last year. The last three are at the bottom of Lake Honrich.
Keep your distance and you shouldn't have anything to worry about.
I'm on my way to a giant camp and I can't guarantee those beasts won't think you're part of the offering.
Mages need to be reminded to be careful around research materials.
Of course I do. If I didn't, most of these books would've been burned to ashes or dissolved to nothing before the Third Era.
My mother taught me. She was a Bard, from the college in Solitude.
I hear they accept most people who apply, if you're ever interested.
My son? Erik? What about him? Did something happen? Is he alright?
Name is Stig Salt-Plank, one of the captains of the Blood Horkers.
Nid. If you wish me to answer your question, you must answer mine.
Oh my... umm, you won't let Mercer hear about this will you? Ahem.
Delvin, that last shipment we heisted on the Cyrodiil frontier was worthless!
You idiot. He said [QUOTE]firs[QUOTE] not [QUOTE]furs.[QUOTE] It was a damn logging caravan!
That's impossible. I distinctly heard that lout in the tavern say it was a full shipment of furs. They should be worth a fortune.
Oh, it's not so terrible. I actually find the work quite relaxing.
Relaxing? They must be working you to the bone! You should rest before you do yourself in.
Not to worry, dear Svana. I promise you I can handle it, but your concern is quite flattering.
How do you do it, Valindor? How do you work at Black-Briar Meadery and the Fishery without getting exhausted?
Oh, no. I won't tell you anything more until we have an agreement.
Oh, no. I'm no fool. You'll learn what you need to know once we've come to an agreement.
Oh, they'll find some way to send us there. It'll be just my luck.
Only criminals get sent to Cidhna Mine. They're not going to send us there.
We're doomed. The mine is going to stay closed, and we'll up be carted of to Cidhna Mine as slaves.
Reliable and headstrong? You're turning out to be quite the prize!
So... now that I've whetted your appetite with our little scheme at the market, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?
Still can't wake him up? Perhaps you're barking up the wrong tree?
He would lie in bed, paralyzed with fear, imagining his own nightmares coming to life. Ooohhh... Scary.
You've headed down the path of dreams. Unfortunately for you, Pelagius suffered night terrors from a young age.
All you need to do is find something to wake our poor Pelagius up. You'll find his terrors easy to repel... but persistent.
Well now, that's something to crow about. With Pelagius up and about you're moving right along. We'll both be home in no time.
Thank you, friend. Don't worry. I'll have that shiv ready for you.
Ah, you're a clever one aren't you? Now, here's your shiv. Promise you won't ever use it on me, okay?
The Divines reveal things to me at times, yes. I do not hide this.
It is a gift. Anyone who believes otherwise does not and cannot understand it.
The Imperials wouldn't have just let you walk away. Remember that.
The temple is the one place my wife finds peace these days, Runil.
It is a hard time for all of us. I hope that you too can find some sanctuary here, Mathies.
Their souls are trapped in Oblivion all the same, and here I stay.
Ah, I was beginning to think the day would never come. So you broke the binding spell, did you? Matters little.
Then get out of my way. I have to get to a town and find a priest.
There are more books to be recovered and secured in the Arcanaeum.
There's something... personal... I was hoping you would do for me.
Very well. I'll give you a chance. But if you can't do it, I will.
We bring you here to make you stronger, new blood. Now let's move.
And the Underforge taps an ancient magic that is older than men or elves.
Here's all you need to know. Jorrvaskr is the oldest building in Whiterun. The Skyforge was here long before it was.
Well, I grow old. My mind turns towards the horizon. To Sovngarde.
Living as beasts draws our souls closer to the Daedric Lord Hircine.
I worry that Shor won't call an animal to glory as he would a true Nord warrior.
Some may prefer an eternity in his Hunting Grounds, but I crave the fellowship of Sovngarde.
Well, yes. But the Key isn't only restricted to physical barriers.
Once you realize the Key can access these traits, the potential becomes limitless.
All of us possess untapped abilities; the potential to wield great power, securely sealed within our minds.
What about you? Are you ready to transact the Oath with Nocturnal?
What's happened? Did you find a way to learn the Dragonrend Shout?
Who is he speaking with? What are they planning? I fear treachery.
It's Cicero. Ever since he arrived, his behavior's been... Well, erratic would be an understatement. I do believe he is truly mad.
But it's worse than that. He's taken to locking himself in the Night Mother's chamber, and talking. To someone. In hushed, but frantic tones.
You and everyone else. Word is it may not happen this year though.
I think I may wait until the Burning of King Olaf to have and Spiced Wine.
You are an Orc, but do not know of Malacath, our master and yours?
You do not know of Malacath? He is the keeper of oaths, the master of curses.
You can try, but I'd keep your sword-arm ready if things get ugly.
You give me one more look, and I cut you open. That Skooma's mine.
You need to be easier on Asgeir. All he wants to do is please you.
No. I'm sorry, I've worked too damn hard to let his life go to waste.
You can't deny the fact that he needs to give back to his people; to fight to keep us free.
You healed the wounded, Nura. You saw their life's blood spilling into the mud, giving back to the land.
That's right. He is your son. He has his own hopes and dreams and we have no right to tell him otherwise.
It would please me if he'd take up arms and fight for to save his homeland. Is that too much to ask my own son?
You will be called upon to rely solely on your Restoration spells.
Knowledge is power. Knowing spells can be powerful, but applying that knowledge is key.
You're a little light on coin there, my friend. No gold, no refit.
Ah, a snitch, eh? Can't have you running to any guards now, can I?
All right, pipe down. You want the whole blessed place to hear you?
The arrangement called for a trade. I hope you'll find this suitable.
An assault. On my watch. By the gods, he'll not get away with this.
And if I were you I'd hurry. I've never seen him this angry before.
Mercer thinks he knows a way to identify this new thorn in our side. He wants to meet with you right away.
And now, thanks to you, the city is back under the Empire's banner.
Long ago, the Empire used the city to garrison troops who guarded the passes to Morrowind.
The Palace of the Kings in which you now stand is one of the last buildings that remain from that era.
Windhelm is one of the oldest human cities in all of Tamriel. In fact, it was the capital of the First Empire, which was founded by Ysgramor
Are you ready for me to show Azura her Star and receive her wisdom?
Azura's Star! I knew the Lady of Twilight had sent you for a reason.
Hand it over to me. I will ask Azura to restore the Star to its original purity.
Banners, huh? Trying to pretty up the place? All right, you got it.
Dahmaan - remember, Alduin also follows his destiny, as he sees it.
If you can see your destiny clearly, your sight is clearer than mine.
But, I bow before your certainty. In a way I envy you. The curse of much knowledge is often indecision.
Even if it means her leaving Ivarstead, I want Fastred to be happy.
If they just snuck out of town together, I could manage my husband.
Now, don't tell my husband, but I don't have any problem with Bassianus.
Oh my. Probably something about the men. We all wish we had her problems.
Good to see you, my friend! I knew you'd make a proper Legionnaire.
I'm glad you're with us. I don't like the looks of this place... and I'm not talking about the Stormcloaks.
I'm glad you'll be with me in there. I don't like the looks of this place... and I'm not talking about the Stormcloaks.
I remember you... You were with us at Helgen... I heard you came around and picked the right side. Welcome to the Legion!
Halt! City's closed with the dragons about. Official business only.
He stayed with us for decades... became an uncle of sorts to Aduri.
Years later, Sinderion simply showed up at our doorstep asking to stay for a while... said he was going to do field research.
Well, after I fled Morrowind during the eruption, I made my way here... my family had purchased this farm and its all we had left.
Help the Dark Elves? Oh, you must have heard me talking to Malthyr.
The Dark Elves live in a run-down slum called the Gray Quarter. Ulfric's content to keep it that way.
I guess they think I can open Ulfric's eyes to their plight, and get him to lift a finger on their behalf.
I'm trying, but Ulfric is set in his ways. For him, there's two kinds of people in this world -- Nords, and the folk beneath them.
Here you go. Your continued assistance to the cause is appreciated.
Here, let's have Farkas show you where you'll be resting your head.
I crave a tale of tall ships and fearless heroes, for heart's ease.
Listen well, friend, and lighten your mood while words I'll spin of warriors bold, whose deeds of valor brought undying fame.
I didn't expect to see you again. What became of my doting husband?
Oh, it's you. I didn't think you could handle this on your own. Did you get rid of Christer?
I didn't want to, but she attacked to try and keep me from leaving.
I just can't be a part of this place any more! The things we do here - evil, evil things. No more!
I hope that doesn't mean things are going to get worse around here.
I've heard. Bolli and Keerava were speaking of it just a little while ago.
Marise, I've come to warn you that the Thieves Guild has been harassing shopkeepers again.
I wish Elgrim had spent more time tutoring me then that Ingun girl.
I'm the Steward of Whiterun. I serve Jarl Balgruuf in Dragonsreach.
Truth be told, I'd be more comfortable if I were back there. I get nervous in the company of so many worthies.
If I'm not being clear enough, that means we don't want him killed.
For now, just keep on his tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.
Aye, he does indeed... and with his fingers in the East Empire Company's pie, we'll make good use of that debt.
If you need a bow, there's one on the rack to the left of the door.
If you want to try, but I'll keep my dagger sharpened just in case.
You can help yourself to any drink you find, but bring me the bottle of Dragon's Breath Mead. It's his favorite, so I know he has one there.
In fact, if you'd fetch my blade from him I'd be most appreciative.
If you must know, I was practicing in the yard when the guard I was sparring with feinted when I specifically told him to duck!
My blade bit right into the stonework next to the keep and needed serious repairs. Thankfully our smith Balimund works wonders.
It requires a filled black soul gem. You will need to kill someone.
When you have a gem and have filled it return to me and I will perform the ritual. I will bring life to your dead body, vampire.
Just for once, I'd like to see her squirm... to rub her nose in it.
Do you know she's slept with three different men in the last month alone? What kind of a woman would do such a thing?
It's not just the work, it's everything about her. She's disgusting. I think she takes her worship of Dibella a bit too seriously.
Last I heard he intended to pass through Eastmarch on his way here.
Last I'd heard, he was crossing the border from Morrowind into The Rift.
Make haste to our camp in Whiterun. I want you on the front lines.
I have a feeling about you. Your place is on that battlefield. I need you there.
Make it quick, and there might be a bowl of hot stew in it for you.
Certainly. I'll be sure to bring some back for you the next time I go hunting.
I've got a recipe for venison stew that I want to try out. Will you have venison anytime soon?
Meet me there. We will fight our way to Namira's embrace together.
It's inside Reachcliff Cave. But the dead have stirred from their slumber recently, and I was forced here.
Until then, tell the people of Markarth that their dead won't be disturbed, anymore. We have bigger plans ahead.
My Alembic. I need it for some research, and can't seem to find it.
A book of mine. I was at least halfway through, and wanted to finish it, but apparently I put it down somewhere.
My dear boy, what makes you think you're getting out of here alive?
My dear girl, what makes you think you're getting out of here alive?
My duties keep me busy in Markarth. I don't know if I can help you.
You are looking for Arkay's protection while you delve some dank tomb, I take it?
No! You mustn't listen to them. They speak only lies and deception.
Had we aided them in releasing the Skull, they would use it to wreak havoc across Skyrim. They... they had to die.
Not here. Let's speak at my home, where we can be alone, unwatched.
Thorald's disappearance has been hard on all of us, but Avulstein has taken it badly.
He's afraid of being taken as well, so he hasn't left the house. All he talks about is Thorald.
Please, help Avulstein if you can. Something has to be done, or we're all going to lose our minds.
Of course, there is always work. My mind is someplace else, though.
There is always work for the Companions. But there is more personal task before me.
Of course. I should've known. Avulstein was behind this, wasn't he?
Of course. I should've known. This was all Avulstein's idea, wasn't it? Where is he?
Oh... well, I'll leave that to you. I trust you know your business.
Probably for the best. It will give me time to see if that old trap still works - and break the news to the men.
Only Dagon can declare if a pawn is worth keeping. I. Have. Spoken.
Same as the others. Looks like she was stabbed, and then cut apart.
It's like an animal got to her, but these are the wounds of a blade.
Shame. But, I'm sure one of the whelps around here will take it up.
So that's what's in there? Coins and weapons? How do you know that?
Really? It just so happens we've been tracking a wagon! For about a day now.
So, perhaps you are not entirely useless... We shall soon find out.
Were you certain in your purpose, you would have no need to apologize.
You have much to learn... But you have proven your will is strong and your heart is devoid of pity.
Tell me, why have you slain those who profess to follow in my ways?
Tell me, why have you slain this one, who trusted you, here upon my shrine?
No, we Daedra are far more powerful than any god. And among my brethren, I am the most feared.
You were weak. Now you are dead. What signs have you left of your passing for us to remember you by?
A god? Assuredly not! Gods are weak and ineffectual. When was the last time you heard or saw evidence of the Aedra in the world?
Thank you. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for you when you return.
Thank you. Thank you! Azura's Prophecy always guide you to fortune.
Speaking of fortune. Here. Everything I earned from my last shipment. It's yours.
The marsh is treacherous. You would do well to not wander at night.
Very good. I'll trust you to get there in one piece. Don't be long.
Your call. Might be safer to travel separately - attract less attention that way.
Don't worry, I'll get Esbern there in one piece. We'll wait for you near Karthspire. Good luck.
Very well. I can't stop you. But I can't bear to watch it, either.
Yamarz refuses help, but I sense that you may be just what we need.
Our Chief, Yamarz, was once a strong and proud warrior. Now he is stricken, cursed.
He is weak, and so our tribe is weak. The giants sense this, and intrude on our territory. Now they assault our very home.
You have wax in your ears? I said no one dies. We're not assassins.
So I've heard. Thanks to you, this should be the last time they forget to pay.
Well guess what... now you've inherited their debt. Don't come back to me until you have every last coin.
One small detail though - I need all of the gold they gave you. No one skims around here. Come back when you've got every last coin.
You see any other inns around here? Where else would I go to drink?
You should bring this information to the Thieves Guild immediately.
Well, whoever this mysterious marking represents, they'll regret starting a war with me.
There's also the matter of your payment. I believe you'll find this more than adequate for your services.
You think that even if I did have one here, I would let you see it?
It would be kept under the highest security. The greatest thief in the world wouldn't be able to lay a finger on it.
You wouldn't have a few minutes to run down to the docks would you?
You're going to happen by and lend poor old Sabjorn a helping hand.
He's going to give you the poison to use on the pests, but you're also going to dump it into the brewing vat.
You're not an Orc, or Blood-Kin, so stay out. We only help our own.
This is our stronghold. Here, we are free to live as Malacath intended, away from the prying eyes of the Nords.
You must have been away from your kind for a long time to forget. Come, speak to the chief and the wise woman and remember.
You're right, I saw it. Didn't want to believe my own eyes, is all.
You've come this far, so I see no harm in concealing it any longer.
The Twilight Sepulcher is the temple to Nocturnal. It's what the Nightingales are sworn to protect with their lives.
Ah, no mere brute mercenary, but a thinker - perhaps even a scholar?
One sure mark of a fool is to dismiss anything that falls outside his experience as being impossible.
You see, when the stories of dragons began to circulate, many dismissed them as mere fantasies, rumors. Impossiblilities.
But I began to search for information about dragons - where had they gone all those years ago? And where were they coming from?
Alduin escaped us long ago. Today we take our well-tempered revenge.
For a hundred lifetimes my heart has burned for revenge on Alduin too long delayed.
Are you loyal to Skyrim? Break into Lod's house and get that letter.
Not against me. Against all of Falkreath. Those Imperial bastards are spying on every one of us.
No. I'm not. I feel like my scales are clawing into me. Maybe you could help an old Argonian out?
Last night I saw Lod the blacksmith writing a letter. Probably sending word to Solitude and General Tullius.
Maybe you'd like to help me keep up appearances? Old Nelacar has a mage's staff in his room in the Frozen Hearth.
It'd be good to have that staff in case the Jarl starts wondering if I actually have a real connection to the College.
Me? Nothing. And I hope to keep it that way. The Jarl is convinced I have some connection with the College, so he goes easy on me.
I heard some of the sailors talking about how they stashed a bottle of Double-Distilled Skooma in the Gnisis Cornerclub. I just need a taste.
Because life was better under the old ways. No Nords and their laws.
Before we get down to business, I've got something I need you to do.
But three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe.
By Shor's command we sheathed our blades and ventured not the vale's dark mist.
Gormlaith the fearless, glad-hearted in battle; Hakon the valiant, heavy-handed warrior; Felldir the Old, far-seeing and grim.
But you might be able to butter them up enough to lower their guard.
They'd be hiding it, of course. Wouldn't want it to get out that they've been lying this whole time.
Anything that confirms that Thorald isn't dead, but is being held captive. I know those Battle-Borns have it.
By the gods... you! But it can't be. You're dead. You... Yeaaaahhhh!
Enthir... Gallus's friend at the College of Winterhold. Of course...
It's the only outsider Gallus trusted with the knowledge of his Nightingale identity.
Get moving. I shudder to think what might happen if you're too late.
The Companions have been asked for assistance, and we shall answer. Particularly when the pay is as good as this.
Had I intended to kill you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
No, I saved your life. My arrow was tipped with a unique paralytic poison. It slowed your heart and kept you from bleeding out.
Hmm. I still don't like it, but I guess I'll overlook it. This time.
Well. I'll let it slide this time. But you'd be smart to take that off. Someone might get the wrong idea.
How can we fight Alduin? Doesn't his return mean it's the end times?
Alduin? The World-Eater himself? But... how can we fight him? Doesn't his return mean it's the end times?
I have no idea, but it's fascinating. Assuming it's true, of course.
And yet now, suddenly, they have chosen to contact you? Why, it's intriguing!
The Isle of Artaeum disappeared over a hundred years ago, and no one has seen them since.
If nothing else, I'd take it as a compliment. The Psijics have only ever dealt with those they feel worthy.
I was blinded. Blinded by dark treachery masquerading as friendship.
Perhaps if I had been more vigilant, then Mercer Frey wouldn't have lured me to my fate and stolen the Skeleton Key.
I will hear no more of this, Harrald. Do you understand me? No more!
Mother, how long must we put up with Saerlund spouting his nonsense about the Empire?
What would you have me do, send him to the gallows for treason? He's your brother, Harrald.
My only concern is your safety, mother. One can only imagine the sordid types he may be conspiring with to bring about your downfall.
I'll be fine. I just need a minute to catch my breath. Find Savos...
I'll bet Bassianus would know what's going on. He understands women.
Oh, Fastred. I'm not sure what happened. One moment she's smiling at me, the next I can't even meet her eyes.
I'll tell everyone we're ready but we'll start the festival at dusk.
Come talk to me after dark, we'll get the festival started when you do.
Great. Looks like you'll be one of us soon.  We'll gather outside the College for the Burning of King Olaf.
I'm very disappointed. I'd advise you to rethink that decision soon.
I can't say I'm happy with your decision. If you change your mind, let me know.
I've tasted your food, Odar. It's better than most songs I've heard.
Sometimes I like to think my cooking is like playing the flute or singing a song.
In fact, they didn't seem to care much for anyone who wasn't a Nord.
Yes, markedly so. Ulfric and his Stormcloaks made no secret of their disdain for the Dark Elves.
The folk of the Empire have always had a more cosmopolitan view of the world, so I'm glad to see them in charge.
Is that right? Here's how the Legion deals with rebel scum like you.
It was the Falmer, wasn't it? Curse them! They've ruined everything!
And you. If you're here for treasure, or wisdom, or anything, I'm afraid you've wasted your time.
If Gavros is gone, there's no hope. He was supposed to return with the crystal... Without that, all our efforts are wasted.
It's as if the merchandise and coin are simply falling from the sky.
Vex and Delvin are having to turn clients away at this point, it's almost impossible to keep up.
Don't forget to check your tribute chest once in a while. As Guild Master you're getting a significant cut of the spoils.
It's lies. All of it. I don't care what she told you, it's all lies.
Let me know. We shouldn't stay here all day. My men want their mead.
Look, I don't really know you. I don't even really know anyone here.
Why do you care anyway? It's not like we're family. This is a business.
My loyalty lies with Solitude. So where Jarl Elisif leads, I follow.
You could say I'm a King's man at heart. Hmph. I guess that's [QUOTE]Jarl's man[QUOTE] now.
Ah... To be honest, no. But High King Torygg supported them, and now her lady Elisif has thrown in with them.
No more than that. I don't want to hear about a killing, understand?
I don't know what the fight is about, and that's not our business anyway.
I just need you to go out there, look tough, and scare this milk drinker into submission.
Not this Empire. The world's better without it. Certainly Skyrim is.
No. I will have no part of any such Empire. And I will gladly gut anyone who says otherwise.
I fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion. I bled and spilt blood for the Empire. And for what?
The Empire to bend its knee before those evil elf bastards? Signing a treaty meant to kill the heart of the Empire itself. To deny Talos?
Now get going... I don't want to see your face until the job's done.
Captain Volf is ashore right now and I want the authorities waiting for him when he gets back.
Now that I think of it, she would have made a fine Imperial general.
Elenwen is a formidable woman. She lacks for neither cunning nor ambition.
Oh yes. After all, what's the point in being miserable all the time?
But being happy or unhappy is a choice you make, and I've chosen to make the best of things that I can.
I know life on the docks isn't easy. Sometimes life puts you in difficult circumstances you didn't choose.
Perfect. This is just what I needed. Here's some gold for your time.
Perhaps you should let a father decide what is best for his own son.
Go and tell Erik that I've changed my mind. I'll see about borrowing some money in Whiterun for his armor.
I... I cannot deny the truth of what you say. Erik is all the family that I have left, but it's wrong to hold him back as I have.
So you have the Voice, then? I would be quite impressed to see that.
Such blasphemies are the calling of mages, not followers of the Way.
Ask Esbern. If he doesn't know himself, he'll know where to find it out.
Take your question to the College of Winterhold. They may be able to help you.
Thank you! Thank you! I'll never speak of this to anyone, I promise!
Ah, you see? That wasn't so hard, now was it? Let's the two of us just forget we ever met, hmm?
Well it's about damn time. Capturing a woman from her home, keeping her bound like an animal. Ridiculous...
Then the hunger set in. Curiosity. What's the harm in just one bite?
It's okay, now. You've found a friend who understands you. You can let go of your guilt.
You were young when you first tasted human flesh, weren't you? A brother or sister had died? An accident, of course.
There is a copse of elms to the east. We could really use that wood.
Mother, I finished cutting at the northern stand. Where do I move on to now?
I was hoping to head into Riften for supplies, but I can do that after I'm done with the elms.
Just be careful, Gralnach. That copse doesn't look safe. If you see any trouble, you run right home.
There'd better be. I didn't come all this way to leave empty handed.
They say that eating the fruit it bears will add years to your life.
We are traveling to the Shrine of Kynareth in Whiterun. I hear the Gildergreen is more beautiful than ever since it's been restored.
They should have drawn it out some more. He deserved a slower death.
Excuse me, I'm trying to watch a traitor to the Empire lose his head.
Thus we must take certain precautions in order to secure our safety.
It is no great secret that we have been unjustly blamed for a great many things over the years.
The good people of Skyrim on occasion would rather pass judgment than attempt to understand what we do here.
Unless it's gold for another round of drinks, I don't wanna hear it.
We supply Falkreath to the south. Until recently we supplied Helgen.
Falkreath trades with the surrounding holds and without our wood they would have trouble keeping their prices low.
We're united, but where should we live? My home is yours, of course.
We face the world together now. Where should we live? My home is yours.
I'm a married man! Hey, where should we live? I guess you could always stay with me.
This is the happiest day of my life. Where should we live? My home is your home now, of course.
I guess we have our entire lives together, now. Where should we live? You could stay with me....
We're married. I guess we'll need to decide where we're living, won't we? You can always stay with me.
Married. It doesn't feel like I thought it would, but I'm happy. Where should we live? You could stay with me....
Well then, what are you waiting for? Get in there and earn your pay.
Whatever you want to know, I don't care. I run a smelter. That's it.
When will I learn how to forge weapons and armor? Isn't that my job?
Your job is to do what I say. And I say you have many nails and fittings to make before you even touch a blade. Now get to work.
Worst thing is, nobody wants them in the cities. Nobody trusts them.
Yeah, these Khajiit make a living traveling the roads and selling their wares.
It's got to be tough. Skyrim's a hard enough land when you've got a roof over your head.
Yes. My collection of artifacts from a group that toppled an Empire.
Yes. Now that you're a Nightingale, you may consider this your home.
Once the Skeleton Key has been restored to the Twilight Sepulcher, I'll make this place my home as well.
You'll find that this place offers many things that will help you in your endeavors as well as a wealth of information for you to learn.
You attacked one of my family. What do you have to say for yourself?
You assaulted one of my family members. I've come to accept your apology.
You! Fetcher! I should kill you for assaulting my family. But I will accept your apology...
You! You hurt my family. I don't like when my family gets hurt. Say you're sorry. Or say goodbye.
You know who I am? You attacked one of my clan. I've come to accept your apology... or your death.
You can't attack my family and get away with it, fetcher! I will have an apology, or your head on a spike. Choose.
Dishonorable dog. You attacked one of my kin. So now you're going to apologize... or I'm going to lop off your head.
Here's the situation. You attacked my family. So now you're going to apologize.. or I'm going to kill you. I hope we understand each other...
You buy my way out of here, and I'll tell you what you want to know.
But it seems we both have needs, friend. Perhaps we can help each other out.
You have a death wish, then? If you know that name, you must know to meet him would be to meet your end.
You didn't know? That was Ulfric Stormcloak and his top lieutenants.
You must go to a fortress, endangered by water, yet untouched by it.
Inside, you will find an elven mage who can turn the brightest star as black as night.
It is cryptic, I know, but Azura's signs are never wrong. I believe the fortress may refer to Winterhold. Ask if they know this elven enchanter.
You would? Well then, I would insist on rewarding you for your time.
Here, take my satchel and give it to my father, Verner. He'll likely have something for you to bring back.
Ah, Borkul muscle one out of you on your way in? Fine. Take this one.
All from inside Cidhna Mine. A Nord prison. The irony is quite thick.
He is the King in Rags. A man who once held all the Reach within his grip.
He stokes the passions of the downtrodden in this city. Directs them to kill the enemies of the Forsworn in our name.
All right, snowback. Who are you, and what are you doing in my tower?
And what? You couldn't read it yourself? Fine, give it here a moment.
Another member of the Family! Hello, hello. So very good to meet you.
Why talk? Cicero has nothing to say to you. Call it a matter of... trust.
No time to talk now, my friend. No time. Out mistress needs tending. Keeping.
Wait, oh wait. I know you! Yes, yes. From the road! Cicero never forgets a face.
Oh, I do wish we could get to know each other better. But not now! I must tend to mother. See her settled.
Arkay. One of the Eight Divines. God of the Cycle of Birth and Death.
It is his shrine people pray to when they visit the Hall. That his divinity will watch over their ancestors on the way to the next life.
As a Nightingale, I've been sworn to secrecy regarding the Sepulcher.
I know the Guild doesn't do much to foster faith, but I'm going to have to ask that you continue to trust me.
As I get closer to the Ebonmere I begin to feel myself slipping away.
Whatever is affecting the Nightingale Sentinels is starting to affect me too.
Even right this moment, I feel strange... when I don't think I should be feeling anything at all.
But at the same time, I don't dare refuse an invitation from Elenwen.
Ill luck. I'm a busy man and I don't have time for this sort of frivolity.
But what I ask of you... it must be done. There is too much at stake.
You think I don't know that? If anyone learned of this meeting, my corpse would swing over Solitude for a decade!
But why did they take her? What could they want with our little girl?
I don't know. The guards are out looking for her, now. They'll be back soon.
You keep saying that. What if she's gone forever? What if they've done something to her?
But you should know that we have a more pressing matter to deal with.
It's... Cicero. There's been an incident. You should proceed into the Sanctuary. I'll let Astrid explain.
Yes, I know. As does Astrid. And you've earned your payment, though the bonus is forfeit, as I'm sure you're aware.
Yes, I know. As does Astrid. You have done well, and have earned both your reward, and a bonus, as I may have mentioned.
Can you believe one person came in here and took out this whole camp?
Well, before that cave-in sealed our ships in here we could loot any size ship we wanted.
Where did you keep all that loot?  I've been here almost a year and haven't seen any of it.
If only we could get our hands on that treasure. We could get out of here and never look back.
Maybe. For now just lay low and do your job. I have a feeling we'll be rid of the Captain soon...
You've been here for a while, right? What was it like back when we could still make runs out to the coast?
Stop yammering and keep your eyes peeled. They could be here at any moment. If I were them I'd come straight here, sword swingin'!
The Captain has it locked away in that drowned ship by his quarters. He says it's [QUOTE]to keep it safe[QUOTE] but I know he's just keeping it for himself.
Changed your mind? Well, I can't give up so easily. I'm heading back.
Darling! I've been waiting for you to return, to consummate our love!
Everyone in town knows about the Black Door, and to never go near it.
Whatever you do, stay away from that Black Door. Being near it chills you to the bones.
Did you hear? People have been seen coming in and out of the Black Door. Divines have mercy.
I've heard that shadowy figures are being seen coming in and out of the Black Door. Gods help us.
Give me a minute to examine the Star. I'll see what we'll need to do.
He needs to die. He deserves to die. And it falls to you to kill him.
Until he's dead... well, I'm sorry, but we would dishonor our oaths as Blades if we continued to help you.
The Blades have been hunting him for centuries, but he was protected by the Greybeards and then the Emperors.
Justice demands that he die for his crimes. Until he is dead, I'm afraid my oath as a Blade prevents me from offering you aid and comfort.
I already knew Delvin, I asked if I could join up, and that was that.
Killing someone in a jail is much easier than what the Dark Brotherhood deals with. I guess I wanted to play it safe.
I don't know. I think I realized that out in the world, my skills would bring me more wealth as a thief rather than an assassin.
I appreciate the delivery, here... I want you to have this. I insist.
Ah, yes... seems he sent back my satchel stuffed with letters. I look forward  to reading them.
I expected no less of you. And once again, you have not disappointed.
And I have already received word that the client is satisfied. You have done well for yourself, and for the Companions.
I hope Falk made it clear that Solitude owes you a debt of gratitude.
In case Falk doesn't make it clear - Solitude owes you a debt of gratitude.
I hope Vignar doesn't find them. He'll ask a king's ransom, I'm sure.
If the gods are merciful, they've found a safe place to hide in the city.
I knew it... Mercer sent you to kill me! Guards, there's an intruder!
I know full well that you have. Please do not insult my intelligence.
Tolfdir is still there now, is he? I shall expect a full report when he returns.
I love the man, bless his heart, but he doesn't know the whole story.
You'll wind up getting yourself killed. Dagur shouldn't have said a word about it.
I must now show them the path that will lead us back to our strength.
There is no progress without sacrifice. No wheat without threshing the chaff.
I have shown the people that when our Jarls drink the Empire's milk, it makes us weak.
The Empire and the Jarls who back them must be swept away. The people demand it. I demand it.
I'll just wait here and make sure nothing foul escapes the catacombs.
I'll speak with Aela about how you handled yourself. Come back later.
I'll speak with Farkas about how you handled yourself. Come back later.
I'm a writer by trade. Not that the people of Skyrim do much reading.
If you're one of the Jarl's men, you'll get your lumber. Anga's Mill pays its debts.
I'm afraid he's asked to not be disturbed. He has important business.
I'm not going to sugar-coat it for you. We're in a bad way down here.
I've been here 50 years, and nothing is going to move me off my land.
What kind of question is that? Look at me! Is this a young man's face?
If anyone will know what the coming of the dragon means, it's Ulfric.
You should come to Windhelm with me and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today.
If that's not enough, I suppose... I have this amulet you could take.
Well, I... I simply thought you might wish to help out one of your fellow mages.
It's just a flute. A really old and valuable flute, but just a flute.
Apparently Larina told him some story about the flute being able to make the dead dance.
It's the least I can do for your help in putting this matter to rest.
Oh dear, I didn't mean to say it like that. That wasn't a joke, really.
Well, all of the previous Apprentices have been accounted for, thanks to you.
Here, why don't you take this. It was intended to be given to the best in their group as a reward for their hard work.
Lost it? Well, at least you showed signs of initiative by telling me.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised with the way things are going around here.
May you carry the warmth of Mara to all corners of the frozen wastes.
Moons protect us! I hope we do not encounter one of them on the road.
I suppose if we do, we will find out just how fast each of us can run.
All this talk of dragons returning to the world makes me more than a little nervous.
As the saying goes, you do not need to be faster than the dragon; you need only be faster than your friends.
My sources tell me you can find that book in a study in his quarters.
It's a well-known fact that the steward keeps all of the records on Whiterun's prisoners in a large book.
Change Arn's entry in the book to anything you want and they'll be forced to let him go after he serves a few weeks.
No! I'm not about to let you ruin everything I've worked so hard for!
Not much. I came here a few years ago from Hammerfell when I married.
The land is beautiful, but I can't stand this cold. I don't know how Rustleif manages it.
And Dawnstar is known for its bad luck. We're the last port of call before Windhelm, and the ore we trade makes rich targets for pirates.
Aye. I've worked on a few moorings here and there for it. Most of the ship captains are superstitious about who works on their vessels, though.
Of course, I have everything you need for sale, if you have the coin.
Ah, a student of the craft. You'll need to start by learning an enchantment.
Once you know an enchantment, you'll need a filled soul gem, and something to enchant. You'll use the Arcane Enchanter for that, too.
Take an enchanted weapon or piece of armor, then use the Arcane Enchanter to learn its secrets. The item is destroyed in the process, so be wary.
Of course... otherwise it wouldn't be much of a reward, now would it?
Your new piece will enhance your skill beyond that of the original. Trust me.
Oh dear, whatever is a girl to do with such fearful brutes about her?
Well maybe if you would finally convince Thongvor to put you in charge of the family, I wouldn't need to question you anymore.
I'll take control of the family on my own time, Betrid. Until then, my brother remains in charge and you'll keep your mouth shut.
Where were you last night, Thonar? Busy with work or have you found some other woman who's willing to tolerate your lack of ambition?
I am busy keeping this family in coin and your pretty little head adorned with jewels, so I'll thank you not to question where I go at night, wife.
One of the terms of the treaty was the outlawing of worship to Talos.
Surely you're aware of the Great War between the Imperials and the Elves who called themselves the Aldmeri Dominion?
To the Stormcloaks, this was viewed as the moment when the Empire became unworthy of the allegiance of any true Nord.
When the smoke cleared, the White-Gold Concordat was signed... it was supposedly a treaty aimed at establishing peace within the Empire.
Please place your hands on the altar. Azura wishes to speak with you.
Surprised to see you working. Mulush almost broke your arm yesterday.
Does it look like I can afford losing a day's wage? That damn Orc isn't getting the best of me.
Take the giant's hammer to Atub, and tell her what has happened here.
The tribe may yet survive, but only if you are willing to do what is right.
Yamarz has fallen. It is now up to you to return the giant's hammer to Atub.
Yamarz has revealed himself as a coward and a schemer, and has earned the fate of all who follow that path.
Thank you. Here's your gold. I'll make a run for it back to Dawnstar.
That's the spirit. Find her and I promise you'll be well compensated.
The first thing we need to do is figure out who's behind the dragons.
The Thalmor are our best lead. If they aren't involved, they'll know who is.
The ivory from this tusk will be perfect for the inlay on my amulets.
These dreams are manifestations created by the Daedric Lord Vaermina.
I must end her terrible influence over these people before the damage becomes permanent.
She has an awful hunger for our memories. In return, she leaves behind nightmares not unlike a cough marks a serious illness.
They should be back shortly. You're welcome to wait here if you like.
This is life, sister. The struggle is what reminds us to draw breath.
This is life, brother. The struggle is what reminds us to draw breath.
Unless, of course, that was your goal all along. Here's your payment.
No sarcasm this time. You faced a vampire, and lived to tell the tale. Well done.
And if you contracted Sanguinare Vampiris, be sure to get that taken care of. Else you'll end up like our own Babette.
Very well, I trust that you wouldn't be here were it not significant.
We know full well about your investment in shipping ventures, Erikur.
Thankfully, Jarl Elisif cares far less about your lost profits than she does about winning the war!
General Tullius needs more money for the war effort. We need the funds to arm and provision more troops.
The Jarl would be wise to remember that it is her thanes - and my profits - that are paying for this war.
I've also heard troubling rumors about dealings between you and the crew of that pirate ship, the Red Wave.
I've heard the Empire plans to levy a tax on our trading ships. Falk, you've got to do something about this.
Then let's increase the taxes on the farms and merchants. We can't afford to lose the loyalty of the ship captains.
With this the world could have a better understanding of the Dwemer!
Come now, where's your sense of propriety? Extorting an old man like this.
Well... I suppose important research is worth every coin. All right. You have yourself a deal. How's double and a half its value in trade?
Wonderful. This will be a splendid addition to my private collection.
Yes. Were I to simply lay down and die, it would not please Malacath.
You and I have work to do. The Silver Hand will tremble at our sight.
He was one of the strongest we had, but numbers can overwhelm. He should not have come without a Shield-Brother.
Get out of here. I'm going to make sure we got the last of them, and see if there's any information to be gotten from the bodies.
You dare approach me here? Are you mad? You cannot hope to defeat me!
You're really going to the Blue Palace? That presents an opportunity.
If you were willing to wear one of Radiant Raiment's outfits and speak to the Jarl I would not only pay you but let you keep the outfit.
Your actions here were a disgrace. You betrayed Skyrim at every turn.
You... you disappointed me. You gave too much away. More than was necessary to secure this truce.
A lofty goal, to be sure. And what brings your search to our doorstep?
Ain't got one. But I'd fancy a chance at that Jaree-Ra's scrawny neck.
Filthy Argonian never would have set foot in this city, if High King Torygg was still alive. I can tell you that.
Alduin... we heard the Dragonrend Shout from here... you defeated him?
All right, but if you change your mind. Not like we're going anywhere.
Another job well done. Your payment is secure, and you have my thanks.
Bit by bit, we bring honor to this land. And you've brought honor to the Companions. More importantly, some gold.
Are you going to help me with my mission? I need someone very capable.
You there, hold! If you are a true friend to Skyrim, you will help me in my mission.
You there! As an officer of the Imperial Legion, I require your assistance to complete my mission.
Be careful. I miss my amulet, but a life cannot be replaced as easily.
You are kind to offer. We believe the bandits are a part of a group headquartered here.
But it must be something you're doing. There's no other explanation...
By the gods. You... you're alive! But I had heard... your Sanctuary...
Please! You mustn't think I had anything to do with that! I wanted the Emperor dead! The true Emperor! I still do! It was Maro! He...
Don't you see? I prayed to the Night Mother! I am the Black Sacrament.
But you're alive! So there's still a chance. A chance to start over, rebuild. That's why I did... this.
Yes. I set you up. I wanted you dead. I betrayed you, the Night Mother, and everything I hold dear. And now Maro has betrayed me.
I just wanted things... to stay the way they were. Before Cicero, before the Night Mother. Before... you. I thought I could save us. I was wrong.
Enough of your dire predictions! We will talk about this another time.
If we win. This war is going to drag on for years. I can feel it. We need to prepare for a long struggle ahead.
We are poised for glory, Jod. The Empire will never take Dawnstar while every last man, woman, and child here draws breathe!
With respect, Jarl. You can't ask everyone to throw themselves against trained Legionnaires. Let's leave the fighting to the Stormcloaks.
You're right. Why dilute the glory with too many souls fighting over it? We'll drive out the Empire and be celebrated as heroes when we win.
Even Tullius may be forced to talk sense in the face of such a threat.
Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true, we're all doomed anyway.
Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true... well, it changes the situation doesn't it?
And if it isn't true... well, then the fight to free Skyrim goes on. Either way, I don't see the use in talking to the Empire.
First it was 6 months, then a year, then 2 years. Now I'm in for life.
Food, experience and a roof over my head in the finest city in Skyrim.
If money's all you hold dear, then you you end up like Jaree-Ra. A plague on the city.
Good, good. Just point me in the right direction and I'll do the rest.
Hey, could you deliver this bottle of Nightshade Extract to Wuunferth?
Everything you see is grown at my family's own Hollyfrost Farm. Fresh and filling.
I also do a little herb growing. The court wizard, Wuunferth, pays us to plant a little Nightshade. Who knows what he uses it for?
Hind siiv Alduin, hmm? No doubt you want to know where to find Alduin?
Zu'u bonaar. You went to a great deal of trouble to put me in this... humiliating position.
I appreciate the gesture, but I'd rather not be in debt to a stranger.
You would give your own coin to help my son? I'm moved by your compassion.
Your kind deed will not go unrewarded, my friend. Tell Erik I've changed my mind, and we'll visit Whiterun soon to fit him for armor.
I believe I'll stay here and bask in Eldergleam's warmth a bit longer.
I can't do this all on my own. Are you... are you offering to help me?
I don't even want to know, do I? But for you... all right. I'll do it.
Hmm. I don't want to get involved in anything beneath my dignity as Jarl.
Say no more. I was wondering what you were doing here... I'm glad to play my part.
Nothing would please me more. I'll keep their eyes away while you do what you came here for.
This is very irregular. I trust that whatever you're doing doesn't compromise my position in any way?
Oh... perhaps not, then. I don't think the Jarl of Solitude should be participating in a childish prank.
That's it? Sure. Shouldn't be too hard. I usually end up making a fool out of myself without even trying.
I don't know... I don't want to do anything that might offend Elenwen. There is a lot of money at stake, after all.
I trust you don't presume on our friendship? I am a Jarl, after all. I wouldn't want to appear foolish in front of these people.
I don't recognize you, but I sense that you're one of us. Who are you?
I go where my brother goes. I think he wants to look around some more.
This place is worthy of some time. You go on ahead. I'll see you back there.
Eventually. But this... this is the Tomb of Ysgramor. I think I'm just going to... commune for a bit.
But you don't have to stay, if you don't want to. I'll see you back at Jorrvaskr. Stories to tell the others, eh?
Not right now. I'm going to look at some of these carvings. I wonder if Ysgramor ever set foot here while he was alive.
I had a bad fall in the mine when I was bringing some food to the men.
I'm still pretty sore and can't really walk too far without having to rest for a while.
I was pretty bad off for a while, but a priest of Mara was passing through on his way to Dawnstar and healed me to the best of his abilities.
I'm afraid so. There's a problem with one of the Jarls here in Skyrim.
I'm not that foolish. The last thing I want is a war with your people.
With the rumors going around about how poorly your Guild's been doing, she's become much too bold.
I'm sorry. I don't know anymore. I'm just visiting here from Cyrodiil.
I've heard of them. Something about the men who live in the hills and attack caravans.
I'm too busy tending to the dead to spend my time making more of them.
And I wouldn't very well tell you about the cuts if I had made them, now would I?
If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift.
The Dragonborn is said to be uniquely gifted in the Voice - the ability to focus your vital essence into a Thu'um, or Shout.
It wasn't my fault! I told them over and over that it was an accident!
They wanted me to prove my worth, so they threw me up against a young whelp of a lad, hardly old enough to grow his first chin-hairs.
I guess they thought a woman wasn't strong enough to hurt him. I didn't mean for him to die! Why would I want that? I just... lost control.
Just got here from the Summerset Isles. Lots of opportunity in Skyrim.
My sister Deeja and I are treasure hunters. We like to collect things.
I bet the two of us, we're very alike. So why not take the next step? We can help each other.
As I said, it's easy to find things nobody will miss. My sister Deeja and I are treasure hunters. You could be too.
It's easy to find things to sell. Things nobody will miss. Things from underground, or just left lying around in someone's house.
No offense, I mean I'm sure you aren't into any of that kind of stuff.
My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I'm afraid to go in by myself.
My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I don't think I can take him by myself.
Now you see why I've warned you against them! Bloodthirsty barbarians!
Of course not. Purely a formality. Now, I need to see your invitation.
One day, the Forsworn will paint the walls of Markarth in their blood.
One day, the Forsworn will paint the walls of Markarth in your kinsmen's blood. Best you not be there on that day, Nord.
Our fires are visible for miles. We're in a low valley. Sitting ducks.
So don't concern yourself with it. Markarth is safe. You have my word.
It's unfortunate that we live in such violent times, but there you have it.
I want to make things clear. Markarth has its troubles, but there are no Forsworn in this city.
They're only a threat in the hills and along the roads, where they live. Everywhere else, we are in control.
Now I've been told that the attacker claimed to be a Forsworn. It's nonsense. More likely he was just sick in the head.
My guards told me. Poor Margret. And witnesses report that the attacker was shouting some nonsense about being a Forsworn.
Thank you, Vex. You've always been the most reliable one in the Guild.
Well, what the hell is Mercer going to do about this mess? Have you even talked to him?
Mercer is being Mercer. If he has a plan to get us out of this rut, then he isn't sharing it with me.
I've picked up some new clients and did a few jobs on my own, but I'm not sure if that will cover our expenses.
Thanks for the help. The Reach has been crawling with Forsworn lately.
It's a wonder people can get anywhere around here. Maybe I'll avoid this entire hold for awhile. That said... I do have a few things to sell.
That I am. Train the recruits. Turn boys into men. That sort of thing.
Work? I demand tribute before you can be considered for any real tasks.
How about drink? None of that local piss. Real Black-Briar Mead, fresh from Riften.
Before my ma and da passed, I told them that one day, I'd become the best trader in Skyrim.
My wife Seren and I run it together. She still smiths even though we found out she is with child.
Our little girl died recently. I've been shouldering my days with strong mead, but nothing gives my Tova peace.
Ever seen a book called [QUOTE]The Mirror[QUOTE]? We used to hand it out to boys looking to learn basic shield work.
I picked up the trade when I was a girl. One of the temple healers staying here on a pilgrimage showed me the basics.
I've been looking for an Amulet of Arkay to remind my wife that our child is with the gods now, but I can't find one.
She had a book with her, [QUOTE]Song of the Alchemists,[QUOTE] that I used to read over and over. I miss having a copy.
I met one of the caravan leaders, Ma'dran. He said he'd help get me started if I could bring him a mammoth's tusk. Easier said than done.
Our son or daughter isn't going to get much Redguard culture here in Skyrim. I know my wife worries how she will pass along her traditions.
Thinking of asking the General for some training books. Give the soldiers something to do while they're on rest. Something besides drinking.
Hey, if you find a book called [QUOTE]Night Falls on Sentinel,[QUOTE] could you bring it to me? It's a story from my wife's people. Be good to have.
The summoning of undead is even less advisable outside of the College.
If you require assistance with summoning techniques, please let me know.
If you would, please also contain your summons to the College grounds. The locals do not need to be agitated further by Atronachs roaming their town.
The warehouse is off-limits. I suggest you head back the way you came.
There's nothing for you in the warehouse, so why don't you take a walk?
The warehouse is for East Empire Company workers only. Entering without permission is a crime.
Then I would be glad to help you with your mad dragon-trapping scheme.
Maybe... hmm... what of the Greybeards? They are respected by all Nords. High Hrothgar is neutral territory.
But getting both sides to agree to a truce will be difficult at this point. The bitterness has gone too deep.
If the Greybeards were willing to host a peace council... then maybe Ulfric and Tullius would have to listen.
They're good company if you want to study necromancy in peace, though.
Bashnag's circle of mages. We - well [QUOTE]they[QUOTE] live here. They made it pretty clear that I'm no longer welcome.
These are no dainty college mages. Bashnag has the skill of a magister and the mind of a warlord. This is a dangerous bunch.
Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds.
The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit.
And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.
For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity.
Very good. Be sure to bring any more Sleeping Tree Sap you find to me.
Very true! Hmm. I wonder... do you know the Jarl's palace in Whiterun?
We have been on our own for some time now. I fear we will not survive.
We must go, quickly now. Take me to Delphine. We have much to discuss.
Well now that's an odd question. Why in the world would you be asking?
What's more, he's got no armor. I'll have to save up the money for it.
But the world is a dangerous place. Erik has no idea what he's getting himself into.
Why are you still standing around here? Go get me the Phial, you fool.
Yes, I was hired to protect the others as we walk the roads of Skyrim.
Ahkari freed me from a prison in Cyrodiil, and now I must repay my debt to him.
It is a thankless task and I would rather be back home in Elsweyr, but I have little choice.
A word of advice, my friend --  do not mix gambling and drink. Taken together, they will empty your pockets of every septim.
You make an example of that gang, I'll give you a year's worth of pay.
The North Wind is my mistress, and I'm her master. I don't tolerate any disloyalty.
You looking for work? Got a sailor who thought running a gang of thieves would be more money than hauling my cargo.
You've found the vessels. I worried that I had sent you to your death.
[QUOTE]An elf that studies stars[QUOTE]? Where did you hear about that?
The mages are up in the College. You can ask them, if they'll let you in.
Then again, Nelacar might know. He's an old-timer from the College, but he has a room here.
Did you say an [QUOTE]elf[QUOTE] and [QUOTE]stars[QUOTE]? I hope you don't know what you're asking.
Studies stars you say? Why, there hasn't been a mage doing anything related to stars since.... Oh....
Why specifically stars? Wait, you aren't referring to... No, there's no way you would know about that.
Stars? You wouldn't be referring to that incident a few years ago? I still say that exile was far too harsh.
I know plenty of spells that produce light, but stars? Hmm. There was that problem a few years ago, but that couldn't be related.
Why would anyone bother to study stars? Well, unless you're talking about that artifact that got all those... dimwits thrown out.
Studies stars? I remember the last time the word [QUOTE]stars[QUOTE] was flown through the Hall of the Elements. Bad things had happened.
A few months ago it was troll fat salve and now he's got something new.
Not that there's anything that can be done about it. He's in good with the Thieves Guild.
Not well I'm afraid. That Brynjolf... he keeps draining the people's pockets with his ridiculous miracle cures.
A man opens a gate and they cut his head off? Doesn't seem right to me.
Are you kidding? Those damn things will drive me right out of business!
Tell you what. Bring me ten of their pelts from anywhere in Skyrim I'll gladly pay you for thinning out the herd.
As you wish. Whatever you can afford will certainly be put to good use.
Because the so-called Emperor is a coward! That's right, I said coward!
Well, I call it blasphemy! A true son of the Empire would never have turned his back on our greatest hero, not at any price.
Well, let me tell you something, friend. Cyrodiil is a long way from here, and in Skyrim, we will never forsake mighty Talos!
Oh yes! He agreed to banish the worship of Talos at the tip of an Aldmeri sword. They called it the [QUOTE]White-Gold Concordat.[QUOTE]
Before the Great War, the Blades helped the Empire against the Thalmor.
Our Grand Master saw them as the greatest threat to Tamriel. At the time, that was true. Maybe it still is.
So we fought them in the shadows, all across Tamriel. We thought we were more than a match for them. We were wrong.
Before the Nords came, we worshipped the old gods, had our own kingdom.
Times have been good and bad since then, but some folks couldn't handle not ruling their own land. Those are the Forsworn.
The Forsworn follow the old ways, but some of those were best forgotten. Blood sacrifices, communing with Daedra. It's the road to ruin.
Divines preserve you, you're a hero. We'll re-open the Hall right away.
Go on. See what she says. Now you've gone and gotten my hopes up again.
Really? Yes, maybe that would be just the thing. She seemed to be playing hard to get when I spoke to her earlier.
Good. If Riften should fall, it's only right that its leader be spared.
Have our scouts come up with any information on these reports of dragons?
Yes, milady. I've also taken the liberty in preparing a private carriage... just in case.
Yes, milady. That unpleasantness at Helgen supposedly involved a dragon. It killed several soldiers before it departed.
I want you to speak to the city guard. Make sure there's a contingency plan in effect in case Riften falls under attack.
Grew up here. Colder as Atmora, but that just grows the beards thicker!
Lot of history in these walls. We're trying to make some more. It's a lucky time to be alive.
Grew up in a stronghold. Every Orc girl tended the forge at some point.
But a girl has to grow up, and life in the stronghold asked for a lot in return, so I joined the Legion. Mastered my trade there.
Ha, nothing like fine spirits to help raise your... well, your spirits!
Hagraven up ahead. Pull the lever when you're ready and we'll take her.
Hah! And what would a witless oaf like you know about raising children?
You keep on like you are, you'll end up with two daughters who hate you.
You're right, it's none of your business. How about you keep your nose out of it?
I'm not saying it's my business, but I have to ask. Why are you so cruel to your little girls?
He introduced me to Gallus, and that was it. I've been here ever since.
And you know what? Despite what I left behind, I don't regret it one bit.
I ended up in Skyrim thanks to a contact I'd made when I was with the Crescents... good old Delvin.
He's taking the Empire to task and making them answer for their crimes.
Ulfric's a bloody hero. I don't think there's a worthy Nord alive who'd dare argue the point.
All I care about is two things: watchin' Maven's back and countin' the gold she pays me to do it.
Hey, if the Empire and the Stormcloaks want to kill each other over some foolish cause, I say let 'em.
I don't think I'll be content until Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim with the ashes of the Concordat at his feet.
Her blessings are many. To love is to know the true nature of the gods.
We are devoted to the Goddess Mara, who gave mortals the gift of love that they might have a hint of eternity.
Here's the deal. I can smuggle some equipment into the Embassy for you.
Don't plan on bringing anything else in with you. The Thalmor take security very seriously.
Your job is to get into the party without being fingered as a spy. I'll take care of the rest.
Give me what you can't live without, and I'll make sure to get it into the Embassy. The rest is up to you.
You ready yet? I need to get back before I'm missed. Remember, you won't have anything except what I smuggle in for you.
Hopefully Skaggi will send word to the Jarl and something will be done.
Seems Kolskeggr Mine got hit by Forsworn. Those madmen get more bold every season.
Was. Forsworn came in the night. Killed everyone. Gat and I are the only ones who escaped.
Pavo and Gat are the only survivors. I'll be sending word to the Jarl about this, but I don't know when help will come.
I always preferred the liver myself. My brother had such a juicy liver.
The toes are my favorite part. I hope I get to take a few home with me.
I don't know how ya' talked Maven into letting me go, and I don't care.
You did something for me, I'm gonna do something for ya'. Here, take the key to Mercer's house. Won't need it any more.
I don't think he likes either Ulfric or Elisif much. Who can blame him?
But I've no doubt he'll prove loyal to the Empire in the end. He's no traitor.
I guess you know what you're doing. I've got to find a way out of here.
No problem. Thanks for springing me. I owe you. Look me up in Riften if you make it out.
I had retained Enthir's services in, uhh, acquiring something specific.
But now he's refusing to deliver. Could you perhaps speak with him, and see if we can come to some sort of arrangement?
I knew when you walked into the Hall of the Dead that you were special.
And here you are. Champion of Namira. Keeper of her ring. You're everything I hoped you would be.
I suppose someone else will need to look after the Apprentices for now.
Yes, from what I've heard I expect Tolfdir will be occupied for some time. Hmm, that is a problem, isn't it?
I undertstand. Now, let me take a good look at this. Over here, please.
I want to help you, Dragonborn. And I will. But I need your help first.
I want you to know I don't trust you, Madena. And I'll be watching you.
So you say. We'll see if that's true when the Stormcloaks make their move.
Well, at the first sign of battle I'll be comfortably sitting in my room, waiting for it to end, so don't you worry.
I'll tell you the same thing I told Skald. I'm here to help the people of Dawnstar, not play politics. Point your suspicions of treachery elsewhere.
I'll have to make a point of re-reading it. I don't recall the details.
Is that the one about something buried beneath Saarthal? Something that men and mer fought over?
I'm good at what I do, maybe even one of the best. But it's all I know.
I've never been one to lead. Never desired it, never cared for it. Don't want it.
I've been at this game a long time, my friend. A long time. I've stolen trinkets from nobles and framed priests for murder.
I'm not really sure. Styrr thinks you have some sort of link to Potema.
I trust his judgment on this. As a priest of Arkay he's had to deal with necromancy before. Nothing as dangerous as Potema though.
I'm not sure. None of them were working on anything terribly dangerous.
If you can bring me these materials, the Phial can again be made whole.
The final step is tricky. It requires the briar heart from a Forsworn of the Reach.
Then we need the tusk of a mammoth, ground to a fine powder as only the giants know how.
On the top of the Throat of the World is a patch of Unmelting Snow. No heat can touch it.
I have some thoughts. There are three crucial elements. Some may be easier to find than others.
It can't be lost. It just can't! It's irreplaceable, do you understand?
You must find it! It cannot end this way! Not after I've worked so hard!
Without it, I cannot finish my work. All these years, so much time, so much energy...
It's not that you're intruding. I'd wager they've actually expected us.
They just want to be sure that you're worthy. Be ready for an honorable battle.
The original Companions. Their finest warriors rest with Ysgramor. You'll have to prove yourselves to them.
Just head north - you can't miss it. It's the capital of Whiterun Hold.
Cross the river and then head north. You'll see Whiterun on its hill as you pass the falls.
Jarl Balgruuf still hasn't declared for one side or the other, so at least you won't run into any Imperials along the way.
Kill him. Take your rightful place as my champion, or I will crush you.
Let's go. I'd rather not stay out here alone any longer than I have to.
Look, we all have our flaws; mine is that women can't get enough of me.
So I had this little affair going on while I was betrothed to a beautiful girl named Svidi.
Well, she finds out and she tells her brother, Wulfur. Then her brother attacks me with a knife... I mean, I had to defend myself!
Not really. Varnius Junius is a fool. I'm sure nothing will come of it.
I suppose if you're truly interested you could talk to Falk. He's the better-safe-than-sorry type.
Nothing, nothing at all! Arniel already overpaid for... whatever it is.
Now you're coming with us. It's a life sentence in Cidhna Mine for you.
We have a nice arrangement in this city, and we're not letting you get in the way.
You have a problem wth that? Take it up with Madanach. I'm sure the King in Rags and his Forsworn would love to meet you.
Now, I need your assistance with a matter of a more... personal nature.
Of course, dear. Of course. And, from what my little ravens tell me, you handled yourself quite well.
Of course! I'd be more than happy to add a donation to our charity box.
Right now, the best you could provide is coin. We need all the help we can get.
Of course... I could fly you there. But not while imprisoned like this.
Only this. You have the Thu'um of a dovah, but without the wings of one, you will never set foot in Skuldafn.
Once I have the sigil stone, I shall inscribe the spells that you seek.
Once you have summoned the Dremora, you will order it to deliver to you a sigil stone from an Oblivion gate.
I will teach you the spell to summon the Dremora, but know that it will only work in a place properly prepared for the event.
Pruzah wundunne wah Wuth Gein. I wish the old one luck in his... quest.
If Alduin himself could not stand against your Thu'um, I feel no shame in my own defeat.
But I doubt many will wish to exchange Alduin's lordship for the tyranny of Paarthurnax's [QUOTE]Way of the Voice[QUOTE].
Since then, they've been working to weaken the Empire any way they can.
They're the high elves that rule the Aldmeri Dominion. Sworn enemies of the Empire and everything it stands for.
Thirty years ago, they invaded the Empire and came close to destroying it. They smashed the Blades in the process.
So, you're finally back. Look, I've been patient, but you still owe me.
Speak with Legate Rikke. She will determine if you are Legion material.
The Legion's always looking for strong, capable warriors. If you think you've got what it takes, our headquarters is in Solitude.
Thank you. I don't know what's going on, but I think I owe you my life.
The General has sent me to obtain a powerful weapon for the war effort.
This was the last great bastion of the Dragon Cult, and their leader's mask was reported to be quite powerful.
The way this war is going there might not be anyone left to drink soon.
The way this war is going you'll soon have plenty of veterans like me to buy drinks.
There are more books to be recovered and secured here in the Arcanaeum.
If you're feeling adventurous, I'm always looking for someone to procure valuable books from some more... dangerous locations.
They have always sought to turn the Dragonborn from the path of wisdom.
Have you learned nothing from us? Would you simply be a tool in the hands of the Blades, to be used for their own purposes?
They may be able to tell you something about the Elder Scroll you seek.
As for where to find it... such blasphemies have always been the stock in trade of the mages of Winterhold.
We have never concerned ourselves with the Scrolls. The gods themselves would rightly fear to tamper with such things.
They see me as master. Wuth. Onik. Old and wise. It is true I am old...
This world is not ready for it. If it remains here, it will be misused.
As you may have learned, this object... The Eye... is immensely powerful.
Indeed, many in the Order believe it has already... Rather, something will happen soon, something that cannot be avoided.
True... But qostiid - prophecy - tells what may be, not what should be.
Qostiid sahlo aak. Just because you can do a thing, does not always mean you should.
Do you have no better reason for acting than destiny? Are you nothing but a plaything of dez... of fate?
Wait... you mean you killed every last one of them? I can't believe it!
We can't afford to lose any men if we wish to keep Falkreath protected.
I would think a man of your military training would be able to do with less but so be it.
Helvard! The guards are looking sloppy today. I want you to reduce their wages for the month.
Sir, I will shape them up but with the war on it is unwise to reduce their wages any further.
We've got trouble right here in Whiterun Hold. Nothing we can't handle.
There's some trouble in The Pale. We need you to go in and clear out an enemy stronghold.
The Rift is seeing a lot of trouble from some riff-raff. We need to head in and break them up.
There's trouble up in Winterhold. I'm a little surprised anyone's complaining about it, but money is money.
There's some trouble in Falkreath. There's always some sort of trouble down there, but now it's come to a head.
We've been hired to deal with some pests in Hjaalmarch. Someone's got them riled up, and you need to put an end to it.
There's some trouble in Eastmarch. Farmers getting troubled by some bad types who've built up a stronghold in the area.
There's some trouble in Haafingar. The Legion's too busy with the war, and they're hiring us to take care of their problems.
There's always some sort of trouble in The Reach, but a local warlord has raised the stakes. We have to handle the situation.
Welcome, child of Malacath. Your kin bid you welcome to our stronghold.
Halt, outlander. By the Code of Malacath, this stronghold belongs to the Orcs. Your kind are unwelcome.
While you were in the Star, Azura gave me a vision. Her last, she said.
Leave this shrine, blasphemer, before I kill you for defiling Azura's artifact.
I have never been without Azura's foresight since escaping Morrowind. I don't know what to do.
If you need me, I'd be honored to accompany you, Guardian of the Star. It would give me a purpose.
You could challenge Burguk, my brother. Yours is the stronger swordarm.
Serving in the Legion taught me to respect leadership. The stronghold needs Burguk.
You got Aldis to tell you something? I knew you would. What did he say?
[QUOTE]You are Ysmir now, the Dragon of the North, hearken to it.[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]Long has the Stormcrown languished, with no worthy brow to sit upon.[QUOTE]
Ah. I sometimes forget you are not versed in the dragon tongue as we are. This is a rough translation:
[QUOTE]By our breath we bestow it now to you in the name of Kyne, in the name of Shor, and in the name of Atmora of Old.[QUOTE]
Ancano is doing something with that thing... the Eye. We can't stop him!
I need you to find the Arch-Mage, and I need you to do it quickly. Get moving!
I haven't seen Savos since the explosion. He must've been blown clear, and he may be injured.
And let's not forget her crew - loyal and bloodthirsty, the lot of them.
Ah, yes. The pirate captain. A ruthless she-devil, by all accounts. Deadly with a blade.
This is my final contract, and certainly the most challenging. Be careful with this one, my friend.
Are you kidding? I came all the way from Cyrodiil just to work with him.
He's... he's not the best teacher. But just watching him, I've learned so much.
Do this task for me and you'll be well on your way to a title in Riften.
Then I want you to head out there immediately and eliminate all of them.
Then there's no time to lose. It won't take long for Sarthis's associates to learn of his death.
The source of the poison must be destroyed once and for all, otherwise another dealer will simply take his place.
I can't afford to have another Sarthis blunder into Riften because they think we're too lazy to disrupt their pitiful operation.
Fine then.  The blood of my family is on your hands as well as Brurid's.
Frabbi, my dear loving wife, could you please clean out our guest rooms?
Clean the rooms yourself Kleppr. It's not like you do anything important around here.
No, just check in the guests and manage the coin and keep a roof over your head. No, nothing important.
Give me your sword, Hjalti. That we may become brothers as you promised.
You promised me, Hjalti. You promised that when we sacked Hroldan, you would make me your sworn brother.
And I've waited. Even after the enemies' arrows dug into my chest and their hammers crushed my bones. I've waited.
Ha! I knew it, you rascal! By Sithis, the old man was worth the trouble.
He will not resist the challenge of your Voice, Dovahkiin. He will come.
But Odahviing, he is... headstrong? Boziik. Rash. Even among the dov, he was known for this.
He is not compelled to come, but the dov are prideful by nature. Few could resist such a challenge. Especially from you, Dovahkiin.
Head up the steps from the market an' look to your right. Can't miss it.
Here, use my sword to do it. I made sure to sharpen it for the occasion.
Dragonborn. Here, use my sword to do it. This moment will be immortalized in song. Make it a good kill.
Hmm, yes. I have been pondering on exactly that question. Lingrah morah.
I have tasted the voices of Alduin's allies on the wind. Pogaan nahlaas, vokrii wah jun.
There is one who I remember well. Odahviing. He is the one to tell us where Alduin has gone.
Odahviing will come to your challenge. Boziik. Krilot. He will not be able to resist your call, from the Hill of the Dovah itself... he will come.
I can't imagine where he found the gold to take it to market so quickly.
