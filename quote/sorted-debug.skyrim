Great, let's go!
Great! Let's go!
Hail, Companion.
Halt, outlander!
Hello, Listener.
Here's your cut.
Hey, be careful!
Hey, melon nose!
Hey, troll bait!
Hhhhuuuuuhhh....
Hhyyaarargghhhh!
Hmm? What about?
Hmm? What is it?
Hmm. As you say.
How do you feel?
I appreciate it.
I feel so alive!
I have a choice?
I live... again.
I should say so.
I suppose it is.
I will return...
I'll do my best.
I'll find you...
I'll... get you!
I'm on it, lass.
I'm ready to go!
I'm sorry, what?
Is dinner ready?
It will be done.
It's the Legion!
Jarl Balgruuf...
Just not by you.
Just play along.
Later, ham hock.
Lead on, friend.
Lead on, sister.
Let me see that!
Let's get going.
Mara be praised!
Most impressive.
Move along, now.
New to Markarth?
No lollygaggin'.
No match at all.
No one here now.
Nobody here now.
Not lately. Why?
Not now, Braith.
Not now, please.
Not so fast Elf!
Now we can talk.
Now you're mine!
Oh no you don't!
Oh, hello hello!
Oh, such colors!
Oh, why is that?
Oh. What's this?
Okay. You're it!
Out of my sight!
Outsiders. Pfft.
Please, lead on.
Please! Help me!
Potatoes? Again?
Reeaaaallllyyyy?
Reyda! Reyyyyda!
Right away, sir!
Secure the door.
See that you do.
Should've known.
So far, so good.
Speak your mind.
Stay back, lord!
Surprise! Ahaha!
Talos guard you.
Talos guide you.
Talos smite you!
Thank you, dear.
Thanks! I'm out!
Thanks. I guess.
That everything?
That's all, hmm?
The Jarl's down!
The other chief!
The Voice? Here?
There! Now, I...
This is a shame.
This isn't over.
This one's mine.
Tread carefully.
Uh oh! Look out!
Understood, sir.
Unghhh... oww...
Until next time.
Very well, here.
Wait, come back!
We follow, then.
We need to talk.
We should not...
We will prevail!
We're so dead...
Well? In you go.
What a sight....
What about them?
What do you say?
What is it, Elf?
What is it, Orc?
What who wanted?
What's going on?
What's the plan?
What's this now?
Where's Anuriel?
Which other one?
Why do you care?
Yeah, good luck.
Yeah, take care.
Yeah. Next time.
Yes sir, I have.
Yes, headmaster.
Yes, what is it?
Yes? What is it?
Yield or suffer!
You are correct.
You are excused.
You are nothing.
You betrayed us!
You did? Really?
You dirty thief!
You go on ahead.
You look strong.
You must kill...
You're an idiot.
You're cheating!
You're pathetic!
You're too slow!
You've returned.
(Heavy breathing)
A moment, please.
Aha! You're back!
And you, Jorleif?
Are you prepared?
As you wish, sir.
Better make sure.
Breath and focus.
Captain, captain!
Catchy, isn't it?
Come on! Come on!
Damn it, no more!
Damn it, not now!
Damn right we do.
Damn you, Mercer!
Death awaits you!
Did you see that?
Die, Grelod! Die!
Do you feel that?
Easy does it now.
Enough. Let's go.
Esbern, look out!
Fear the Thalmor!
For the fallen...
For the Forsworn!
Forsworn forever!
frustrated grunts
Get away from me!
Get away from me.
Give it, quickly.
Glad you're here.
Go with the gods.
Go with the Nine.
Go, boys! Attack!
Go. Away. Please!
Gods be with you.
Gods... damn you!
Good day, Grelka.
Good luck to you.
Goodbye, Karliah.
Goodbye, my love.
Guards! Forsworn!
Have you seen it?
Help me, help me!
Here we go again.
Here's your gold.
Hey, slug-breath!
Hey, what the...?
Hey, who's there?
Hey! What's this?
Hin laas los dii.
Hist spit on you.
Hmm. What's this?
Hmph. Yes, Nepos.
Horkers' revenge!
How goes it, son?
I can't talk now.
I could take her.
I could take him.
I don't know you.
I don't think so!
I don't think so.
I hate this game.
I will, I will...
I work the forge.
I'll... Kill you!
I'm eager to try.
I'm fine, Madena.
I'm here to help.
I'm on your side!
I'm watching you.
I've... failed...
Imperial bastard.
Is someone there?
Isn't it amazing?
It shall be done.
It wasn't so bad.
It would ruin me.
It would seem so.
It's time to act.
Jolly good guess!
Kel drey ni viik.
Kill the vampire!
Lead on, brother.
Leave that to me.
Leave, outlander.
Let's see here...
Look out! Draugr!
Looking for work?
Looks dead to me.
Looks slow to me.
Mistress, a word?
My point exactly.
My thanks to you.
Need a new blade?
Nerevar guide me!
Next, the Breton!
Next, the lizard!
Nivahriin joorre!
No one here does.
No. Not possible.
No.... Not again!
Not this again...
Nothing personal.
Now hit it again.
Now off with you!
Of course you do.
Oh gods, my ears!
Oh yes, Listener!
Oh, goodbye then.
Oh, no you don't!
Oh. Oh, I see....
Oho! Not so fast!
Olaf! It is time!
On one condition.
Over by the tree!
Over here! Hurry!
Pirates, you see.
Please, carry on.
Praise to Namira!
Prepare yourself.
Protect the Jarl!
Qiilaan us dilon!
Ready to do this?
Ready to give up?
Really? How nice.
Relax, new blood.
Rexus. The items.
Right... Helgen..
See for yourself.
Shadows take you!
So now he's dead.
So you may think.
So... we're done?
Sovngarde awaits!
Sovngarde saraan!
Sovngarde... sir.
Spare me, please!
Stay under cover!
Steady, old girl.
Stormcloak lover.
Su'um ahrk morah.
Tell him, Ulfric.
Thank you, Laila.
That was amazing!
That's strange...
The Greybeards...
The one and only.
They're fearsome!
This is not good.
This way, my son.
This way, please.
Thorald? Thorald!
To see the fires!
Unngh...  Uhhh...
Vampire! Burn it!
Vampire! To arms!
Waiting for what?
Watch the blades.
We hunt together.
We summon Potema!
Well done. Again.
Well met, hunter.
Well? Is it done?
What do you mean?
What do you need?
What do you want?
What? What is it?
What's going on?!
What's happening?
What's the hurry?
Whatever you say!
Whatever you say.
Whenever you are.
Where will we go?
Who has a sister?
Who's this, then?
Woah... watch it!
Yeah, sure, okay.
Yeah, what of it?
Yeah? What is it?
Yes? No? Nothing?
You are banished!
You are new, yes?
You are, are you?
You bear my ring.
You have no idea.
You little thief!
You may go now...
You mean nothing!
You need but ask.
You play so well.
You want a drink?
You won't get me!
You...must...die.
You're dismissed.
You've bested me!
You've done well.
Your end is near!
A debt. Is a debt.
A pleasure, thane.
Aaaayyyaarrrrgghh!
Aedra, what a day!
Agh! Flithy n'wah!
Agh! Who did this?
Ah, there you are.
Ah! Don't do that.
Aiiiiiiieeeeeeee!!
All right, mother.
All set, let's go.
Already done, sir.
And how about you?
And mine is yours.
And so it is done.
Another quiet day.
Anything I can do.
Are you listening?
Arkay protect you.
As you were, then.
Back to my book...
Be safe, traveler.
Blood running hot?
By all the gods...
By Ysmir, a thief!
Can we talk later?
Careful with that.
Come on, hurry up.
Come on, this way!
Come on, this way.
Come on! Let's go.
Come, my champion.
Daar Lein los dii.
Damnable jester...
Dibella, guide us.
Did you hear that?
Die, you sonofa...
Do enjoy yourself.
Do we have a deal?
Don't fall behind!
Don't go near him!
Don't worry, I am.
Enough... of this!
Faaz! Paak! Dinok!
Farewell, kinsman.
Farewell, my lady.
Farewell, Sabjorn.
Fight or die well.
Filthy pickpocket!
Fine, here you go.
Fire is not a toy.
For me? From whom?
Gather 'round all!
General Tullius...
Get 'em! Kill 'em!
Get a bad feeling.
Getting tired yet?
Go away... please?
Go on in, already.
Gods I'm so tired.
Gods, what a mess.
Good, you're here.
Goodbye, assassin.
Greetings, mother.
Greetings, sister.
Ha! You caught me!
He is... the Void.
Hello there, miss.
Hello, Lady Mjoll.
Here you go, dear.
Hey, cheese brain!
Hey, skeever butt!
Hmm. We shall see.
How did you do it?
How disappointing.
How goes the hunt?
I appreciate that.
I beg your pardon?
I cannot best you!
I didn't touch it!
I don't blame you.
I have work to do.
I heard something.
I serve no mortal!
I suppose so, yes.
I won't back down!
I won't hold back!
I'll fix you good!
I'll let him know.
I'll make you pay!
I'll never submit!
I'll see you burn!
I'll... get you...
I'm afraid you do.
I'm getting bored.
I'm not impressed.
If it even exists.
Is it not allowed?
Is it really dead?
Is that wise, sir?
It makes us right.
It seems cowardly.
It was a pleasure.
It's about Ranmir.
It's just up here.
It's not that bad.
It's still coming!
It's... nothing...
Just a... scratch!
Just here to work.
Just... stay back.
Krif krin. Pruzah!
Lead on, Listener.
Lead. I'll follow.
Let's begin again.
Let's finish this.
Let's keep moving.
Let's see here....
Let's talk inside.
Look at that fool.
Look for yourself.
Mighty impressive.
My blade is yours.
My eyes are sharp.
Nnnnooowwwwwww....
No one crosses me!
No way. I'm quick!
No. Not like this.
No. Now shove off.
Not in our nature.
Nothing after all.
Oblivion take you!
Oh no, not at all.
Oh, if you insist!
Oh? What about it?
Okay, I'll go now.
On your way, then.
One, two, three...
Out with it, then.
Ow! What did I do?
Please... mercy...
Positively vulgar.
power attack grunt
Rrrraaaaaaggghhhh!
S'rendarr's mercy!
Scourge of nature!
Shadows take me...
Shut up, will you?
Silence, prisoner!
Smell that? Blood.
So, the same then.
Some wine, please?
Sorry, Miss Temba.
Speaking of harsh.
Stay away from me!
Stop back anytime.
Stop right there. 
Stop the intruder!
Stop your whining.
Take care, dearie.
Take care, friend.
Talos be with you!
Talos preserve us.
Talos protect you.
Thank you, friend.
Thank you, milady.
Thank you, milord.
That is the truth.
That is true, yes.
That's a good man.
That's all I know.
That's far enough.
That's the spirit.
The beasts return!
The city is yours.
The Eye of Magnus?
Then it's decided.
There! All better.
There's no escape!
This way, come on!
This way! Come on!
This way. Come on!
Thu'um wah Thu'um!
Time to die, hero!
To the keep! Move!
To the next fight.
Tragic, of course.
Treachery! Attack!
Treasure, you say?
Ugh... damn thing.
Uhh.. thank you...
Uncle Calcelmo....
Until later, then.
Very much so, yes.
Watch out. Wolves.
We take our leave.
We'll get to that.
Welcome to Riften.
Well done, indeed.
Well met, kinsman.
Well, hurry it up!
Well, not exactly.
Well, yes! Please!
Well? Out with it.
What did you hear?
What did you need?
What did you want?
What do you think?
What gave it away?
What in the world?
What should we do?
What? Oh, goodbye.
What? You have it?
What's happening?!
Which one is that?
Why am I fighting?
Why won't you die!
Yes sir, fine sir.
Yes, yes. Goodbye.
You can't beat me!
You cannot escape!
You hear anything?
You need to leave.
You puny weakling!
You saw her ghost?
You win! I submit!
You're a dead man!
You're dead! Dead!
You're outmatched!
You're telling me.
Your life is mine!
...As you say, sir.
Ach, there you are.
Agh! It... hurts...
Ah, that's too bad.
And damn the Moot! 
And his name is...?
And if I surrender?
Are you a stranger?
Are you Dragonborn?
Are you still here?
Argh! You found me!
Awaken, and perish!
Back to my errands.
Best tell the Jarl.
Best to keep clear.
Bolog aaz, mal lir!
By Sithis, help me!
Can't hide from me.
Come here a second.
Come on, just open.
Come on. Finish it!
Coming... Mother...
Couldn't be busier.
Darkness guide you.
Death to the Nords!
Di kiirre fen alok.
Die, you Orc filth!
Does Dravynea know?
Don't muck this up.
Don't patronize me!
Dragonborn... wait.
Enough... enough...
Everybody get back!
Fall to me, dragon!
Farewell, farewell!
Farewell, stranger.
Feeling any better?
For the Dragonborn!
Foul blood drinker!
Get me out of here!
Get out of my face!
Get over to Riften.
Get this gate open.
Gimme a mug of ale.
Glory to Nocturnal!
Go wrong? Go wrong?
Gods, not again....
Gods... the pain...
Good morning, wife.
Good. Honor to you.
Got metal to shape.
Greetings, brother.
Guards! Trespasser!
Ha! That's my girl.
He has to be lying!
He's deceiving you.
Hello, Fralia dear.
Hello? Who's there?
Help me! A vampire!
Hey! Don't do that.
Hhhhhhuuuuuuaaaaaa!
Huh? Don't do that!
Hurry, cut me down!
I am yours, master.
I cannot be beaten!
I do not like fish.
I enjoyed our talk.
I give, and I give.
I shall do my best.
I smell weakness...
I'll pass it along.
I'll see you there.
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm not done yet...
I'm right with you.
I'm sure. I'm sure.
I've got your back.
Insolent bard. Die!
It can't be helped.
It is time, Yamarz.
It's been an honor.
It's in the clouds!
It's just business.
It's time to leave.
Just here to drink.
Just keep swinging!
Keep your distance.
Keep your guard up.
Let me stew. Alone.
Let me try again...
Let's go, let's go!
Let's kill someone.
Let's tread softly.
Listen. All of you!
Lock the city gate.
Maybe they're gone?
Move! Up the tower!
My... my what, now?
Next, the dark elf!
Next, the high elf!
Next, the Redguard!
Next, the wood elf!
Ni faas, Dovahkiin!
No, but this one...
Now you're talking.
Now, get of my way.
Now, you try it Aia
Of course you will.
Of course, my lord.
Oh! Oh... no... No!
Oh. Well. Good day.
Okay, there you go.
One more... pull...
Only a couple more.
Oooh. Time to kill?
Piss off. I'm busy.
Please get me home!
Please remain calm!
Precious release...
Push off, will you?
Quickly, follow me!
Ralof of Riverwood.
Ready to get going?
Right away, milady.
Right away, milord.
Rrrraaaaarrggghhhh!
Ruki? Where is she?
Shut up back there!
So ends the lesson.
So... very tired...
Sorry to hear that.
Submit to Her will!
Sweltering in here.
Take care, husband.
Talos preserve you.
That can't be done.
That Cicero feller?
That was delicious.
That would be best.
The defiler waxes! 
The White take you!
The... the Gourmet?
This drink's on me.
This is for Haldyn!
This is ridiculous.
This place is huge.
This should be fun!
This should be fun.
This what you want?
Thu'umii los nahlot
Ulfric Stormcloak! 
Uncle Alvor! Hello!
Victory... for now.
Wait... I know you.
Want to come along?
We are on the hunt.
We lost everything.
We will speak more.
Well met, traveler.
Well, I don't know.
What are you doing?
What can I get you?
What else is there?
What have you done?
What just happened?
What? Err, nothing!
What? What is this?
Who did this to me?
Who left that here?
Who's the fool now?
Why? What did I do?
Yes sir, of course.
You are not worthy!
You are not worthy.
You can't catch me!
You can't win this!
You don't scare me.
You have a visitor.
You have done well.
You have my thanks.
You have questions?
You know the rules.
You need something?
You never can tell.
You still here? Go!
You want something?
You won't get away!
You won't get away.
You work the forge.
You're a damn fool.
You're still alive!
You're still alive?
You've been warned.
Your length is cut!
Your shroud awaits!
Ysmir... curse you!
Yyyyrrrraaaaahhhhh!
A pox on the Empire!
Adelaisa, I'm sorry.
Again with the mead!
Ah, a man of action.
Ah, err, yes. Sorry.
Alain is... is dead?
Alduin mah nol thur.
Always a pleasure...
And for ourselves...
And you avenged him.
Anyone see anything?
Are you a Greybeard?
Are you on the hunt?
Are you ready to go?
As you say, my Jarl.
Aye, 'til next time.
Back so soon Xander?
Be careful up there.

Bow to your betters!
But I'm thirsty now.
But she's so stupid!
By the Twin Moons...
Can you get it open?
Come on, fight back!
Come on! I dare you!
Come. Face your end.
Court is in session.
Crystal....  gone...
Damn. Another fight.
Death to the Empire!
Diplomatic as usual.
Disgusting... beast!
Does anyone see him?
Don't cross me, Elf.
Don't leave me here!
Don't make me laugh!
Don't screw this up.
Don't talk such rot.
Enough of your lies!
Enough! Both of you!
Fall to the Thalmor!
Families torn apart?
Filthy... barbarian!
Get out of my face. 
Get out of my sight!
Get out of my sight.
Get over to Morthal.
Get your ward ready.
Glad you were here. 
Gods, you're boring!
Gods! Another fight.
Good journey to you.
Good luck out there!
Good luck out there.
Good to talk to you.
Good. Don't fail me.
Good. Now get going.
Got any ale or mead?
Greetings, Listener!
Ha, enjoy the Chill.
Ha! You're pathetic!
He he. Thanks, papa.
Help me out of here!
Here's your payment.
Hey! Wanna play tag?
Hey! Where did I go?
Hmph. Suit yourself.
Hod. Just come here.
Hold and stand down.
How are you feeling?
How are you, Drevis?
How did you do that?
I can't get it open.
I die for my people.
I do... I do indeed.
I guess I was wrong.
I have faith in you.
I have herbs to mix.
I have metal to dig.
I knew I'd find you!
I love a good fight!
I remember that axe.
I will feast on you!
I won't bend. Never!
I...I'm fading away!
I'll have some mead.
I'll have your head!
I'll meet you there.
I'll skin you alive!
I'll tear you apart!
I'll think about it.
I'm counting on you.
I'm ready. Let's go!
I'm ready. Let's go.
I'm...I'm invisible!
It speaks the truth.
It won't be a waste.
It's as bad as ever.
It's time to decide.
Just saying goodbye.
Just... stand still!
Keep to the shadows.
Keep your eyes open.
Keep your scales on.
Khajiit will follow.
Kind of sad, really.
Klimmek? What is it?
Lead me into battle.
Leave me alone, Lod.
Leave or be removed.
Let us see it, then.
Let's cut you loose.
Lokir of Rorikstead.
Magic. Foul magic...
Mmm. That felt nice.
Move along, citizen.
My power is supreme!
My Thu'um is strong!
No more.... No more!
No one bests an Orc!
No turning back now.
No! The Eye is mine!
No. I have my pride.
No. Not again. Help!
No. Oh, please no...
Nobody here anymore.
None of my business.
Not even for a look.
Not here. Follow me.
Not now. Stay alert.
Not today, we can't.
Not too bad, I hope?
Now it is your turn.
Now that is a shame.
Now we're in for it.
Of course. Let's go.
Of mine? What is it?
Officially, nothing.
Oh my. How precious.
Oh, didn't you know?
Oh, got more to say?
Oh, yes, Miss Hulda.
Oh, you old charmer.
Oh! Look over there!
Oh! You behave, now!
Oh... what happened?
Okay, what'll it be?
On your knees, worm!
Over by that bridge!
Paaz. A fair answer.
Please, cut me down!
Please, let's hurry.
Please! Don't shoot!
Put up a real fight!
Quickly, what is it?
Ready to get moving?
Right. Happy trails.
Run fast, my friend.
Safe travels to you.
Shadows consume you.
Shall we get moving?
Skyrim will be free!
So you really are...
So, what's the plan?
Something to report?
Stay away from that.
Stay out of trouble.
Step aside, citizen.
Still standing here.
Sun feels good, hmm?
Take your best shot!
Talos be with you...
Taxes. I love taxes.
Thank you, my chief.
That voice is power!
That you have. Here.
That your best? Huh?
That's close enough.
That's for the best.
That's more like it.
The Elder Council...
The feast has begun!
Then we have a deal.
They have catapults.
They're at the gate!
Think nothing of it.
This is my treasure!
This should be good.
Time for you to die!
Too much... can't...
Very well, Listener.
Waste of time, then.
We sure showed them!
We'll soon find out.
We're not done here.
We've almost got it!
Welcome to our home.
Well, yes. Probably.
What a waste. Fools.
What in the world...
What is it you want?
What is it, Khajiit?
What is it, Malborn?
What is it? Dragons?
What prey awaits us?
What's done is done.
What's on your mind?
What's she on about?
Where have you been?
Why are we stopping?
Why didn't you then?
Why the impropriety!
Yeah, got this note.
Yes, I recognize it.
Yes, suffer for you.
Yes, yes... goodbye.
You are no true Elf!
You can't defeat me!
You can't take that!
You can't tell them!
You ready to go yet?
You speak the truth.
You were at Helgen! 
You... you go first.
You're a dead woman!
You're a talker, eh?
You're already dead.
You're going to pay!
You're good as dead!
You're not worth it.
You've already lost!
Your choice, friend.
Your end draws near!
Your fate is sealed!
Yyyyyeeeaaaaahhhhhh!
...go murder a clown.
Agh! Pathetic mortal!
Agreed. To the death.
Ah, kill it. Kill it!
And the message, sir?
Another round, on me!
Any luck on your end?
Archer in that tower!
Are you feeling sick?
Are you here to help?
Arkay watch over you.
Be careful out there.
Be seein' you around.
Bleed for me, mortal!
Can't do that. Sorry.
Certainly, I'm ready.
Christer?  He's here?
Cleared out, I guess.
Come in. Quickly now.
Come on, you monster!
Crazy, naked n'wah...
Damn, where'd you go?
Darkness consume you!
Darkness destroy you!
Dead? Oh my goodness!
Death feeds new life.
Destroy the intruder!
Don't be so petulant!
Don't touch anything!
Don't worry about me.
Don't you dare. Ever.
Done, then? This way!
Dovahkiin! Here I am!

Good fighting to you.
Good work. Take this.
Got somethin' to say?
Graaah! I'll get you!
Greetings, Arch-Mage.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Have a good contract.
Haven't up until now.
heavy sigh of disgust
Help! Somebody, help!
Here, have one on me.
Here's the situation.
Het siiv nunon dinok.
Hey, get out of here!
Hey, good to see you!
Hey! That's my sword.
Hmm. Yes, here it is.
How about some armor?
How do you do, thane?
How nice to meet you.
How's business today?
How's the mine today?
I ain't done nothin'.
I am at your service.
I am yours, Listener.
I am yours, mistress.
I believe we're done.
I can't believe it...
I can't pay, I can't!
I cannot be defeated!
I feel... unbeatable.
I have no complaints.
I look forward to it.
I need another drink.
I need more children.
I offer you eternity!
I said let's go. Now.
I said shut up, scum!
I saw you steal that!
I sense a presence...
I shall not be bound.
I think it's holding!
I think they're gone.
I, uhh... wait, what?
I. Will. Destroy you!
I... am... eternal...
I'd better get going.
I'll cut your throat!
I'll do my best, sir.
I'll give no quarter!
I'll rip you in half!
I'll see you at home.
I'll take care of it.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm right behind you.
I'm sorry my Brother.
I'm sorry. Good luck.
I'm taking it anyway.
I'm too old for this.
If that is your wish.
Imperials! Kill them!
Is that the murderer?
Is this no longer so?
It is a shame though.
It speaks truthfully.
It's been a pleasure.
It's better that way.
J'zargo is listening.
Just get out of here.
Just go away, please.
Just pay them, Bersi!
Keep a sharp eye out.
Keep it away from me!
Keep your distance...
Keep your eyes on it!
Keep your nose clean.
Kill well, and often.
Kill well. And often.
Korvanjund. Remember?
Kynareth preserve us.
Laelette! She's dead!
Late One-seventy-one.
Lead on, we're ready.
Leave that dog alone!
Less talk, more hunt.
Let me take a look...
Long live the Empire.
Look alive, will you!
Make sure that he is.
Malacath protect you.
Mara protect us both.
meanspirited laughter
Mighty decent of you.
Mortal? Insufferable.
No need to get rough!
No one can defeat me.
No, I don't think so.
No, no. Goodness, no!
Nocturnal, save me...
Nope, sorry. Nothing.
Nope. Not even close.
Not for us, it isn't.
Not here. Downstairs.
Not now, I'm working.
Nothing... Nothing...
Now that was a punch.
Now that's just rude.
Now what's going on?!
Now you're one of us.
Oh, probably a troll.
Oh? I hadn't noticed.
Okay. Just this once.
Okie dokie, Listener.
Our terms are simple.
Out of the way, meat.
Perhaps. Perhaps not.
Please, just go away!
Put your weapon away.
Rrrrraaaaaarrrrr!!!!!
Saadia, wake up dear!
Sahrot thur qahnaraan
See you in Sovngarde.
Shoot the far target.
Sir, are you serious?
So about this axe... 
So endeth the lesson.
So what's your story?
So who's winning now?
Some of them, anyway.
Someone do something!
Sorry, what was that?
Sovngarde awaits you!
Speak. I will listen.
Stay sharp out there.
Staying safe, I hope?
Stendarr be with you.
Surely you're joking?
Take that thing down!
Talen! Another round!
Talos guide you, lad.
Talos watch over you.
Tasty, sugary treats!
Thank you for asking.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you, Harbinger.
Thank you, my friend.
That can be arranged.
That may be the case.
That message is this.
That was a close one!
That's how it's done.
That's not fair, now.
That's the way it is.
That's what they say.
The Dark Brotherhood?
The ears of the wind?
The Order shall rise.
Then lead on, friend.
Then that is my task.
There he is! Get him!
There! Now attack it!
There's a difference?
They demand the Moot.
They mustn't stop us!
This isn't happening!
This looks promising.
This won't take long.
This... isn't over...
Through the inn! Now!
To Oblivion with you.
To Whiterun with you.
Victory or Sovngarde!
Wait, is that a tail?
We better keep going.
We follow our hearts.
We need to move. Now!
We'll see about that.
We're almost through!
Well all right, then.
What a waste of time.
What brings you here?
What did you call me?
What has he done now?
What is it this time?
What is it, Argonian?
What is it, Imperial?
What is it, Redguard?
What is your bidding?
What's the situation?
Where are you hiding?
Where'd you stash it?
Whew. That was close.
Why are you stopping?
Why can't Froa do it?
Work in it? I own it.
Worry about yourself.
Wow! I'm see through!
Yeah, yeah. Go on in.
Yep. Ale's going bad.
Yes, Dean. Thank you.
Yes, General Tullius.
Yes, yes. What is it?
You are weak, mortal.
You can't be serious.
You cannot escape me!
You damn well better.
You have a grim look.
You have a job to do.
You have been warned.
You ready, auxiliary?
You should come, too.
You think it'll work?
You wanted to see me?
You! Please, help me!
You're free to leave.
You're short on coin.
Your life is forfeit!
Your time runs short.
Yyyyyyyaaaaaahhhhhhh!
...sweet Night Mother.
(yawn) I'm so tired...
A kill you must repay.
A reasonable strategy.
After you, Dragonborn.
Aggghh! Re...lease me!
Alduin sizaan midroti.
All right. What is it?
All right... End it...
Already taken care of.
An astute observation.
Anavchnzel is waiting.
Another one. Terrible.
Any word on that fire?
As you wish, Listener.
As you wish, my Thane.
At the market, father.
Aye, with a certainty.
Blessings be with you.
Busy with the smelter.
But ten little cuts...
But you don't, do you?
But... I... very well.
But... What of Yamarz?
By all means, show me.
By Azura. The Gourmet!
Can I get you a drink?
Can we both be chiefs?
Can't say that I have.
Certainly. Be careful.
Come on now, old girl.
Come on, I won't bite.
Congratulations, boss!
Daedra take you, then.
Did you take the head?
Die, you filthy beast!
Do you need something?
Don't let me keep you.
Elder Scrolls. Indeed.
Everyone, inside. Now!
Everything's in order.
Excellent work, child.
Finally. Now get lost.
Fine, leave me to die.
For Ulfric and Skyrim!
Get in there and push!
Get off the road, boy!
Get over to Falkreath.
Get ready for a fight.
Glory to the Forsworn!
Go, leave me in peace.
Going to cry now? Huh?
Gonna rip you... open!
Good luck, Dragonborn.
Good to see you, dear.
Ha! I thought as much.
Haming, get over here!
Has your fever cooled?
He might just make it.
Help will arrive soon.
Here, this is for you.
Here. This is for you.
Hevnoraak is defeated.
Hey, that isn't yours!
Hmm? What do you want?
Horker skin, actually.
How can I assist, hmm?
How deep is this cave?
How do you know of me?
How much does it cost?
How'd you end up here?
How's the forge today?
Huh? What do you want?
I am yours to command.
I can do this all day!
I can smell your fear.
I do. Now and forever.
I feel better already.
I hardly felt a thing.
I have a favor to ask.
I have silver to bend.
I said, next prisoner!
I should have guessed.
I think they like you.
I'll be here, my dear.
I'll follow your lead.
I'll meet you outside!
I'll never forget you.
I'm glad I could help.
I'm going to find you.
I'm headed to the inn.
I'm just here to mine.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm sure you're right.
I'm too swift for you!
Inside the house. Now.
It just feels so slow.
It's all in this note.
It's time to die, dog.
Just give me a moment.
Just you wait and see.
Keep your blade ready.
Keeping busy, Sergius?
Lay down your weapons!
Lead us to your Sybil.
Leave - me - a - lone!
Let me do the talking.
Let's be done with it!
Let's get going, then.
Let's get out of here.
Let's hope we succeed.
Let's talk for moment.
Like I said. Hagraven.
Live long. Fight well.
Lookin' forward to it.
Looking for something?
M'aiq is done talking.
Make Laelette go away!
Make sure that she is.
Make yourself at home.
Malacath preserve you.
Mara will protect you.
May the gods keep you.
May the Hist guide us.
Maybe you can help me.
Meat from fresh kills.
Mind your mother, boy!
Moan, done as a zombie
My wife is dead! Dead!
Nah. I don't think so.
Never. Now move aside.
Nice try, fat-fingers!
No mercy for the weak!
No need to get snippy.
No offense, of course.
No, it... it can't be.
No... not like this...
None. Not back to him.
Not if I get it first.
Nothing seems to work!
Now let's keep moving.
Now that guy was nuts.
Now that was a battle!
Now that's a real man!
Now there's a mystery.
Of course. Right away.
Oh, but you are wrong.
Once more into danger!
Only if I can help it.
Only that it happened.
Ooh. That had to hurt.
Oooh... pretty colors.
Please, don't kill me!
Plenty of iron to dig.
Quickly, come with me.
Right. See you around.
Right. Till next time.
She is here, among us.
Shoot the left target.
So serious! (Laughter)
So what can I get you?
Some other time, then.
Somebody do something!
Something smells foul.
Sooner than you think.
Spells have no effect!
Stormcloaks! Get them!
Tacitus? What is this?
Take care of yourself.
Talos guide you, lass.
That didn't take long.
That's not my problem.
That's what I thought.
That's...that's...wow.
The Dread Lord awaits!
The guard has the key.
Think you can take me?
This better be good...
This is how it's done.
This way, my daughter.
This will be worth it.
Told you that, did he?
Ugh. What do you want?
Um, I don't know, why?
Understood... husband?
Vaermina forgive me...
Victory for Nocturnal!
Wait, before you go...
We meet again, mortal!
We should get started.
We should keep moving.
We were... very close.
We're done then? Good.
Welcome to the Midden.
Well, he is the mayor.
Well, if you insist...
Well, not yet, anyway.
Well... if you say so.
Well... let's hear it.
What a vulgar display.
What am I going to do?
What can I do for you?
What do you want, cat?
What is it now, Viola?
What is it, my friend?
What was that, Legate?
What, um... What next?
What? No! Guard, help!
What? Raise the alarm!
What... what happened?
Where'd you come from?
Which one was the rat?
Who are you? Intruder!
With me, up the tower!
Worthless mercenaries.
Wwwwwwrrrraaaaaahhhhh!
Yes, you certainly do.
Yes? What do you need?
You are free to leave.
You call this a fight?
You dare challenge me?
You dare hide from me?
You have a death wish?
You have my attention.
You Imperial bastards!
You lead, I'll follow.
You need to hear this!
You need to leave now.
You pathetic weakling!
You really don't know?
You should leave. Now.
You throw a mean hook.
You were right Galmar.
You, meat! Come, come.
You. What do you want?
You... You can see me?
You'll listen to this.
You're clear to enter.
You're probably right.
You've got some nerve.
A challenger is near...
A stirring in the dark?
Ah yes, their trickery.
Ahh, yes. I see it now.
All right. Open her up.
And a very ancient one.
And another one for me.
And what might that be?
Another poor soul lost.
Anuriel, a word please.
Any luck with Sapphire?
Any news of the Alik'r?
Anything good in there?
Anything I can get you?
Are you all right, Gat?
Are you two quite done?
As he should I suppose.
Aye. She's by the fire.
Back to making weapons.
But... we had a deal...
By the gods, my ears...
Can you spare any coin?
Careful with that fire.
Come and face me, then!
Come on, show yourself!
Damn Stormcloak rebels.
Did you hear something?
Did you need something?
Did you want something?
Divines watch over you.
Do I make myself clear?
Do you have any orders?
Do your worst, monster!
Don't hurt me! You win.
Don't just stand there.
Don't you need my help?
Done? Let's get moving.
Each has their own way.
Enjoy your last breath!
Everyone else, with me.
Farengar! Enough, fool!
Fastred, we must speak.
For me, a heavy burden.
For the sons of Skyrim!
Forgive me, my brother.
Free of charge for you.
Fresh fish! Fresh fish!
Get away from me. Liar!
Get it over with, then.
Get over to Winterhold.
Give em the dogs, boys!
Give it your best shot!
Give Vex a kiss for me.
Glory to the Arch-Mage!
Glory to the repulsive!
Go on, get out of here!
Go on, get out of here.
Gods bless you, healer.
Gods guide you, Hadvar.
Gods' blessings on you.
Good fight going, here.
Good journey, my child!
Good luck, Nightingale.
Good speaking with you.
Good. Chat time's over.
Gourmet? Why I... Um...
Ha ha ha ha ha! Hooray!
Have it your way, then.
He said he loved me....
He'll do no such thing!
Here, for your trouble.
Here, this should help.
Hm? Something's near...
Hmm? What're you doing?
Hmm? What's this about?
Hold on, what was that?
Honor to you, my Thane.
How could you? Just go.
Huh. I feel better now.
I am not! You're lying!
I bid you safe travels.
I can smell your shame!
I can't talk right now.
I don't need your help.
I doubt that very much.
I grant you a new life!
I hate giving speeches.
I have a prison to run.
I have letters to read.
I knew you could do it!
I know you can hear me!
I like your shop, Lami.
I serve the Dragonborn.
I swear, I'll kill you!
I weep for you, mortal.
I will find you, Fjola!
I won't say no to that.
I... Willl... kill you!
I... Yes, I understand.
I'll be right with you.
I'll enjoy killing you!
I'll keep that in mind.
I'll see what I can do.
I'll see you in pieces!
I'm in no mood to joke.
I'm just the cook, lad.
I'm with you, Listener.
I've got my eye on you.
I've had enough of you!
If only that were true.
In a Daedra, of course.
Into the dark with you!
Is that all you've got?
Is... is someone there?
It will be my pleasure.
It's a religious thing.
It's a shame, isn't it?
It's nothing. Carry on.
It's really dead, then?
Just leave me in peace.
Just what you see here.
Keep walking, stranger.
Let's see them make us.
M'aiq wishes you well. 
Meet me at my quarters.
Mind your own business.
Mmm hmm. Anything else?
Must be my imagination.
Must have been nothing.
Must you keep stopping?
Must've scared 'em off.
My time has come again.
Naw, mostly just froze.
No need to do that now.
No, I certainly didn't!
No. It's not. Trust me.
Not here. Come with me.
Not like that it isn't.
Not to mention our pay.
Nothing I can't handle.
Nothing there. Strange.
Oh, and to be with you!
Oh, do you need a room?
Oh, look at the colors!
Oh, no... No, no, no...
Oh, thank you my chief!
Oh, that sounds lovely.
Opportunities for what?
Our Lord! She has come!
Out of my way, kinsman.
Outta my way, stranger.
Perhaps. But not today.
Please excuse the mess.
Please, enjoy yourself!
Please, enough already!
Please. Take your time.
Prove yourselves to me!
Really? I hope it hurt.
Rise up and live again!
Roggvir. You damn fool.
Running won't save you.
Send Ulfric my regards!
She might just make it.
Shoot the right target.
Shor have mercy on you!
SILENCE - do not record
Skuldafn fen kos dinok.
So many things lost....
Something wrong, Ahlam?
Soon, my dearest. Soon.
Sorry, all out of coin.
Speak, and then begone.
Stay away from Camilla.
Stay close to the wall!
Stop! That's priceless!
Take out their archers!
That is a lot of blood.
That looks dangerous...
That must be the Voice!
That's right. It isn't.
That's so sweet of you.
That's the end of that.
The forge is hot today.
The honor will be mine.
The man doing your job?
The pain is so great...
The ritual is complete.
There goes another one.
There's only one chief!
This doesn't look good.
This isn't a good time.
This must be her, then.
This must be him, then.
This way, friend! Move!
Through here. Let's go!
Time to... finish this!
To arms, boys! To arms!
Up the stairs! Quickly!
Use everything we have!
Vengeance for Laelette!
Wait just one moment...
Want to talk? Go ahead.
We fight till the last!
We have to keep moving.
We never saw him again.
We shall soon find out.
We'll be waiting, then.
We're right behind you.
Welcome to the College.
Welcome to the Warrens.
Well enough, I suppose.
Well met again, Hunter.
Well, explain yourself!
Well? You done or what?
What can I get for you?
What do you need, bard?
What was it you wanted?
What? What do you mean?
What're you lookin' at?
What're you looking at?
Where are you thinking?
Where else would we be?
Where is that lazy man?
Who will speak for her?
Who will speak for him?
Why am I not surprised?
Why are you doing that?
Why are you still here?
Why do you ask me that?
Would you look at that!
Wow! That's impressive.
Yeah, that was a shame.
Yes mother? What is it?
Yes, champion of Azura?
Yes, I hope this helps.
Yes, Madame Ambassador.
Yes, Thane. What is it?
You afraid to fight me?
You are troubled, Gorm.
You both agree to this?
You can't hide forever!
You can't hide from me!
You fight like a child!
You fight well, sister.
You should. I miss you.
You. Weapon. Away. Now!
You... you did? He has?
You'd best hurry it up.
You'll pay for this....
You're as good as dead!
You're going to Riften.
You're making me angry!
You're my... friend....
You're no match for me!
You've decided to help?
Your blood, Dragonborn.
Yuck. Something smells.
A bold but foolish move.
A cave. Dark. Dangerous.
All hail the Dragonborn!
Alright, then. Let's go.
And if he still refuses?
And the Whispering Lady.
And where would that be?
And... what did she say?
Another who seeks death.
Are we ready to proceed?
Are you all right, dear?
Are you here to save me?
Are you prepared to die?
Are you sure about this?
Arkay's blessing to you.
Arn? Never heard of him.
Barbas, at your service.
Be seein' you, stranger.
Better this one than me.
Both of you... out, out!
By your orders, Captain.
Call yourself a warrior?
Can I get you something?
Carrots? Really? Okay...
Come on, close the door.
Come on, put up a fight!
Come on! Light the fire!
Command me, my Listener.
Damn Imperial arrogance!
Damn. We've got trouble.
Death comes for you now!
Death to the beastblood!
Die, ya cowardly lubber!
Do they? How delightful!
Don't blame you one bit.
Don't cause any trouble.
Don't get too far ahead.
Drem Yol Lok. Greetings.
Everything well, Jesper?
Excellent. I can't wait.
Feel the bite of my axe!
Finally! Let's end this.
Fine. Let's trade, then.
For Whiterun and Skyrim!
G...Gavros? Is that you?
Get him out of my sight.
Get out. Leave me alone!
Get over to the capital.
Gettin' to old for this.
Give me a reason to try.
Go and pick some fights.
Go away! Leave me alone!
Go on, leave me alone...
Gods, what have we done?
Good people of Solitude.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Hammers don't have legs.
Have you lost your mind?
Have you tried to Shout?
Here to dig. That's all.
Here's for your trouble.
Here's what I can spare.
How are the little ones?
How's the newcomer look?
I can hardly believe it.
I could use a hand here.
I don't want to do this!
I must be getting jumpy.
I must be on my way now.
I must protest, my Jarl.
I return to you, Father.
I send you to your rest.
I think I almost got it.
I think I expected more.
I think we're done here.
I used to think so, too.
I... am Lucien Lachance.
I... shouldn't say that.
I... won't... surrender!
I'll explain on the way.
I'll just be here, then.
I'll read it. Thank you.
I'll rip your heart out!
I'll tear you to pieces!
I'll... I can... just...
I'm getting out of here!
I'm going to enjoy this!
I'm going to find you...
I'm gonna find you, Elf!
I'm having fun, are you?
I'm itching for a fight.
I'm just the cook, lass.
I'm shopping. Excuse me.
I'm starting to think...
I'm staying out of this.
I've been expecting you.
I've got my eyes on you.
If that makes any sense.
If the Nine are willing!
If you win, you go free.
In a manner of speaking.
INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK
Is someone following me?
It is time for us to go.
It was nice to meet you.
It would be my pleasure.
It's back to work, then.
It's been easier lately.
It's time for you to go.
Just stay out of my way.
Lead on. I'm behind you.
Let him guide your path.
Let's make the exchange.
Light, medium, or heavy?
Long life to you, Thane.
Long live the Arch-Mage!
Loose ends and all that.
Make your peace, mortal!
Mama, where did papa go?
Master Borri is waiting.
Maybe this is a way out?
Me? Ha! Are you serious?
More tea, Pelly my dear?
Murdered! In cold blood!
Must be new around here.
My soul is now prepared.
No one can save you now!
No, haven't seen anyone.
No! Don't hurt me again!
No... I was trying to...
No... not by a mortal...
Normally, a quick death.
Now get out of my house!
Now you're going to pay!
Now, I need to be alone.
Now, on to other things.
Now, take a deep breath.
Oh my. That isn't right!
Oh yes. Oh yes, indeed. 
Oh, good, more of those.
Oh, how kind! Thank you.
Oh, look. A Nordic ruin.
Oh, this should be good.
Oh! Bolli... yes, hello.
Oh. Is that all? Really?
Our vengeance will come.
Out of my way, outsider.
Pack your things and go.
Perhaps a little harder?
Perhaps some other time.
Please take the Lexicon.
Please, someone help me!
Praise to you, champion!
Ruth wah nivahriin joor!
Seems a bit short to me.
She's a girl. She cried.
Shoot the middle target.
Show me what you've got!
Sigrid! We have company!
Skooma addict. Get lost.
Sky above, Voice within.
So, you reveal yourself!
So, you're here to help?
Something's happening...
Sosaal fah hin vothaarn.
Sounds good. Be careful.
Stay your hand, warrior!
Sure, what have you got?
Sven, we need to talk...
Thank you for your time.
Thank you, land-strider.
Thank you, marsh-friend.
Thank you, oh thank you.
Thank you. I'll be here.
Thank you. Please hurry!
Thanks for the business.
That makes Twenty-Three.
That remains to be seen.
That takes care of that.
That would be wonderful.
That's all I know, okay?
That's it! You found it!
That's kind of you, Lod.
That's the last of them.
That's the wrong answer.
The blood calls, sister.
The pleasure's all mine.
There you are, weakling!
There's the man himself!
They should be so lucky.
They're up on that wall.
This can't be happening!
This can't be happening.
This fight is pointless.
This is a little creepy.
This is our only chance.
This is the end for you!
This is your final hour!
This looks like the way.
This what you want? Huh?
Ugh. It's talking to me.
Until next time, sister.
Until next we meet, lad.
Up in that tower! Quick!
Vampire dust? Seriously?
Wait. Something's wrong.
Was it something I said?
Was there anything else?
Watch it, there, sister.
Watch what you're doing.
We don't stand a chance!
We'd better keep moving.
Welcome to Shor's Stone.
What a display of color!
What are we waiting for?
What are you lookin' at?
What are you looking at?
What are you starin' at?
What can I getcha, Alva?
What did ya do that for?
What do you want... cat?
What next, giant snakes?
Where did you find this?
Where do you want to go?
Which one is that again?
Whistling - no subtitles
Why don't you stay dead?
Why, good evening Jonna!
Yeah! Get her! Kill her!
Yeah. Kind of scary too.
Yes, but... not so loud!
Yes, fellow Nightingale?
Yes, I suppose there is.
Yes!  The path is clear!
You clean out that muck?
You dare fight a Dunmer?
You dare invade my home?
You don't have a chance!
You fight well, brother.
You gonna hurt me again?
You have a mighty voice!
You have yourself a bet.
You heard him. Go on in.
You needed to know more?
You thieving little elf!
You turned me invisible!
You want to move? Where?
You won't take us alive!
You're making a mistake!
You're right. Follow me.
You're right. It's mine.
Your chief Talos-hunter?
Your invitation, please.
Your mistake, Companion.
Ysmir's blessing on you.
[QUOTE]I survived[QUOTE]?
A dragon! I saw a dragon!
A good point, old friend.
A problem? Let me see it.
About time you showed up.
Ah Please! Don't hurt me!
Ah! That felt refreshing.
Ah! Well done! Well done!
All right. Don't be long.
Alms? Alms for a veteran?
And how do you know this?
And now winter is coming.
And we gave it to Elisif?
And we gave it to Erikur?
Anything you say, Mother.
Are you out of your mind?
Attack while it's landed!
Back to my studies, then.
Back, eh? Ready to brawl?
Back... to... the Void...
Because it's always true.
Beem! What are you doing?
Been itching for a fight.
But first... dir ko maar.
But that's not the point.
But tomorrow. Definitely.
But we had been deceived.
But whales eat razorfish.
But you know what I mean!
Calcelmo? What about him?
Can't trust these things.
Changed your mind I hope?
Clavicus gave him an axe.
Damn faithless Imperials.
Death to the Stormcloaks!
Do it, Listener. Kill me.
Do they know where he is?
Don't do that, it's mean!
Don't play dumb, Tullius!
Don't see that every day.
Don't stop. Keep cutting.
Enough of this! Fight me!
Eternal slumber awaits...
Even its name is an echo.
Failure is not an option.
Fair fight. Here you are.
Follow me, it's this way.
Gee, thanks for the help.
Get me down. Get me down!
Get ready. Trouble ahead.
Go ahead... try to Shout.
Gods above! Look at that!
Gray-Mane or Battle-Born?
Great, back to the fight.
Greetings, fellow hunter.
Greetings, Shield-Sister.
Guess it's all clear now.
Guess they deserved it...
Ha! We'll see about that!
Have anything for us yet?
Have I made myself clear?
Have you found something?
He'll never find me here.
Hello, child of Kynareth.
Help! I'm being attacked!
Hey, let's talk a second.
Hey, welcome to the mill!
Hey! It's the bard-to-be.
Hey! My hangover is gone!
Hey! This could be handy!
Hiding will not save you!
Hmph. Hardly a challenge.
Hold on, my boy. Hold on!
Honest, I didn't take it!
Hooray for the Arch-Mage!
How are you feeling, Vex?
How can I help you today?
How could you, Erandur...
How's about a drink, Hod.
How's the training going?
Hsss! Dead. Who did this?
I ain't much for talkin'.
I do miss that helmet....
I don't like strangers...
I don't see 'em any more.
I get so lonely out here.
I knew I could trust you!
I knew I heard something!
I know I heard something.
I like the pretty lights.
I never miss a good meal.
I see no reason to fight.
I surrender! I surrender!
I... I apologize, master.
I... I will. Thank you...
I'll bathe in your blood!
I'll be right behind you!
I'll be right here, then.
I'll be sure to tell her.
I'll meet you over there.
I'll see you there, then.
I'll spare you - for now.
I'll spit on your corpse!
I'll take my leave, then.
I'm endin' you right now!
I'm too upset to talk....
If that is what you wish.
It's locked for a reason.
It's over! Everyone stop!
It's up to her, isn't it?
Jarl Balgruuf is waiting.
Just bring it back to me.
Just what I was thinking.
Keep your head about you.
Khajiit guards your back.
Last warning. Leave, now.
Lead us to our next task.
Leave me alone, Braith...
Let's get this over with.
Let's go tell the others.
Let's not waste any time.
Maar saraan ko Sovngarde.
May song speed you along.
Maybe you'd like a taste?
My wife. They killed her.
Namira grants us victory.
Nearly thirty years, now.
Need some metal hammered?
No. That won't be enough.
Nocturnal, guide my hand!
Not your concern, anyway.
Now tell me where she is!
Now, what do you all say?
Now, what is it you want?
Now, you. Get down there.
Of course, here. Be well.
Oh of course. My mistake.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Oh, now, do be careful...
Oh, that's just adorable.
Oh, there's a better way.
Oh! I didn't expect that!
Oh! What did you just do?
Perhaps it was nothing...
Please, just let me be...
Please... I... not now...
Plenty of chores to do...
Quite a climb, wasn't it?
Salmon sounds good today.
See you around, handsome.
Shall we proceed, friend?
Shor's blood, the Thu'um!
Sir, we really must talk.
Slay it! Slay the dragon!
So that's a no I take it?
Some gate guard you were!
Some other time, perhaps.
Sorry, no time. I'm late.
Stay out of my way, boot.
Stay out of trouble, Elf.
Stay out of trouble, now.
Stay out of trouble, Orc.
Stay where I can see you.
Stop! Enough! Stand down!
Suffering to all mankind!
Thanks for talking to me.
Thanks for your business.
That gave me the shivers!
That museum is a mistake.
That the best Ulfric has?
That the best you can do?
That was a long time ago.
That wasn't a fair swing.
That wasn't what I meant.
That's certainly unusual.
That's enough out of you.
That's it! That's my bow!
That's it. One more time.
That's not going to work.
That's putting it mildly.
That's... all you've got?
The blood calls, brother.
The last one was warm up.
The person who writes it.
The Thalmor never forget.
Then pay with your blood.
There's no need for that.
They're miners. Harmless.
This better be important.
This one needs something?
This shouldn't take long.
Time for your final rest!
Time to find another job.
Time will prove me right.
Twilight guide your path.
Until next time, brother.
Until next we meet, lass.
Very well. You may enter.
Wait, I hear something...
Wait, what are you doing?
Was Jarl Ulfric with you?
Was there something else?
Watch it with that thing!
Watch it, there, brother.
Watch yourself out there.
We all have faith in you.
We are routed! Fall back!
We go up, yes? Always up.
We make quite a team, eh?
We need to bring it down!
We should go get the axe.
We will see about this...
We're done here, I think.
We're ready when you are.
We've got a new order in.
Well met, mage of Skyrim.
Well, good. They're gone.
Well, I... Don't you see?
Well, if the shoe fits...
Well, that was important.
Well... just get it done.
What about the other one?
What are you waiting for?
What could this place be?
What do you make of that?
What do you need to take?
What do you want with us?
What do you want, lizard?
What have you done to me?
What in Oblivion is that?
What is it that you need?
What say you, Dragonborn?
What the...I'm invisible!
What would you ask of me?
What? Oh... you're right.
What's all the commotion?
Why did I ever come here?
Why is it always raining?
Why you little filcher...
Why? What's he doing now?
Won't lie, I am. And you?
wordless yell of defiance
Wujeeta, we need to talk.
Yeah, I got one for sale.
Yeah, you need something?
Yeah. You beat people up.
Yes, thank you Arch-Mage.
Yes, to General Tullius. 
Yes, yes, what is it now?
You are not welcome here!
You beasts are the worst.
You better get some gear.
You break it, you buy it.
You call yourself a Nord?
You don't stand a chance!
You have found my beacon.
You must bring her to us.
You ready to hear me out?
You see a lever anywhere?
You should have run away.
You there! Wait a moment.
You up for another wager?
You will?! Oh, thank you!
You, go pack your things.
You... you have? Already?
You'll... pay for this...
You're going to the fort.
You're headed to Morthal.
You're mine now, Logrolf.
You're pushing your luck.
You've done well, hunter.
You've ruined everything!
Your death will be swift!
Zu'u ni faas gaaffesejul.
...I can't believe this...
A small test, if you will.
Actually, you do. Sort of.
Aghh! Just... die already!
Ah, you saw that, did you?
Aim for the middle target.
All for an old crown, huh?
All right, you want to go?
Always good to see 'em go.
And it's full of vampires?
Are those parts ready yet?
Are those two at it again?
Are your sales going well?
Aren't you... embarrassed?
Aw, quit your bellyaching.
Aye, that sounds like him.
Bah! Stop wasting my time!
Bolar and I will tell you.
Bring more gold next time.
Burn it! Burn the vampire!
But I can't open the door.
But strength doesn't hurt.
By Shor, what do you want?
By the Divines, I'm tired.
Cease fighting. It's over.
Come coward, now we fight!
Come in and shut the door.
Come on, Arniel. Let's go.
Come visit again sometime.
Damn it, I lost my page...
Damnit woman, stand aside.
Dead? How did this happen?
Death is highly overrated!
Dibella's blessing to you.
Did anyone else hear that?
Die now, and live forever!
Do you need anything else?
Don't even think about it.
Don't let it get me. Help!
Don't let your guard down.
Don't make a mess of this.
Don't talk to me, defiler.
Eh? Did you say something?
Faal Kel...?! Nikriinne...
Falion, I am disappointed.
Farewell, Brother Casimir.
Geh, Sahloknir, kaali mir.
Go away. Go away. Go away!
Gods... Everyone get back!
Good luck. Mara bless you.
Good that you're so eager.
Good, you're finally here.
Good. Don't die out there.
Good. Here, take this key.
Greetings, Shield-Brother.
Ha ha! I love a challenge!
Have yourself a great day!
He was after Margret. Why?
Hhhhhuuuuuzzzzzaaaaahhhhh!
Hmm. I don't see anything.
Hold on, my dear. Hold on!
Hope nobody misses that...
How are you today, Thaena?
How can I argue with that?
Huh. I had heard you died.
Hurry! Get me out of here!
I ain't scared of nothin'.
I am honored to be chosen.
I am proud of all of you. 
I can take care of myself.
I can't get a bead on him!
I can't wait here forever.
I don't know why I bother.
I don't see the relevance.
I fight... because I must.
I guess you can have that.
I have no idea what to do!
I hope I didn't scare you.
I look forward to it then.
I must return to Markarth.
I owe you my life, friend.
I return to the shadows...
I take care of my friends.
I vowed to have your head.
I was done talkin' anyway.
I was done talking anyway.
I will commune with Azura.
I will walk alongside you.
I won't go down so easily!
I won't let you hurt Alva!
I... I don't want to talk.
I'll bury you in darkness!
I'll fight you to the end!
I'll keep watch from here.
I'll kill you, I swear it!
I'll send you to Oblivion!
I'll show you what I know.
I'm afraid I've lost them.
I'm glad we agree on this.
I'm just here to clean up.
I'm keeping my eye on you.
I'm ready, let's continue.
I'm warning you. Back off!
I've been looking for you.
If only I could, Listener.
In time, I believe I will.
Into the tunnel. Let's go.
It worked... you did it...
It's all been for nothing.
It's best you leave me be.
It's kind of dark in here.
It's not worth dying over.
Just say the word, master.
Just what I was afraid of!
Kjeld bothering you again?
Leave... Leave... Leave...
Let me see that journal...
Let me speak to our guest.
Let's see if this works...
Let's see what you've got!
Let's see where this goes.
Looking to fix your armor?
Make up your mind already.
Master Einarth is waiting.
May I help you, Arch-Mage?
May Talos bless your days.
May the gods preserve you.
Mine's closed. Move along.
Mother? Can I talk to you?
My debt is repaid at last.
My money's on the big one.
My thirst will be sated...
No more! I yield! I yield!
No shipments have come in.
No thanks to you, Casimir.
No, not recently at least.
No, which is fine with me.
No... But I belong to her.
Not a failure, my servant.
Not bad. Now turn me back.
Not half as sorry as I am.
Not so tough now, are you?
Now ain't this a surprise.
Now if you'll excuse me...
Now that's the true Voice!
Of course not. My mistake.
Oh dear. What should I do?
Oh splendid, another Nord.
Oh, and one final thing...
Oh, look! We have company!
Oh, well, um... thank you.
Oh, yes, right, of course!
Oh, yes. Goodbye, goodbye.
Oh. Um. Well... You see...
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.
Oooooh... weeeeoooooo.... 
Our business is done here.
Ours is to follow, friend.
Point that somewhere else!
Poor bastard's better off.
Represent us well, sister.
Safe travels, landstrider.
See you around, my beauty.
Sentries! What do you see?
She doesn't have the scar.
She just wouldn't hear it.
She... She didn't make it.
She'll never find me here.
Sneaking is overrated, eh?
So I hear. Come here, you.
So, it's to the pain then!
Something's going on here.
Sorries don't help anyone.
Stay out of trouble, Nord.
Stormblade. It's an honor.
Sure, pick on the old guy!
Take us to Movarth's Lair!
Talos bless you, my child.
Talos protect you, friend.
Teach you to mess with me.
Thank you for your custom.
That is one... big hammer.
The College will not fall!
The intruder has vanished.
The people are behind you.
Then I must do this alone.
Then I'll see you at home!
Then stop wastin' my time.
Then stop wasting my time.
There's the woman herself!
This fight makes no sense.
This is hopeless! Retreat!
This is not just a dagger!
This is your last mistake!
This isn't over, Jorleif! 
Thought I heard something.
To maintain relationships.
To Oblivion with you then!
Until next time, guardian.
Use Dragonrend, Dovahkiin!
Uuuuhhhnnnn... it hurts...
Was that really necessary?
Watch the skies, traveler.
We could fix you right up.
We knew you would succeed.
We're off to a good start.
We've got to stay focused.
We've stopped. What is it?
Well, is it taken care of?
Well, no... I... I mean...
Well, what is it you want?
What are you doing, s'wit?
What did you want to know?
What do you think this is?
What do you think, genius?
What in the bloody blazes?
What is the music of life?
What the... Don't do that!
What troubles you, my son?
What wasn't I clear about?
What? A dragon? In Helgen?
What? That's not possible!
What's this nonsense? Bah.
Where the Dragon attacked?
Where've you been all day?
Who among you can help me?
Who dares disturb my rest?
Why? Why do you pursue me?
Will I ever see you again?
Wonderful, just wonderful!
Wonderful. Where to begin?
Yeah, it was stupid of me.
Yeah? What's your problem?
Yes, Arch-Mage. Thank you.
Yes, I'm sure that's true.
Yes, let's get down to it.
Yes, okay. Well thank you.
You belong to Hircine now!
You could have just asked.
You don't have time? Fine.
You got here just in time.
You heard the man, Ulfric.
You just said it yourself.
You looking for something?
You meet your end, mortal.
You must really need that.
You need to not bother me.
You think you can take me?
You want a real fight, eh?
You want something or not?
You... must be Dragonborn!
You'll never get the claw!
You're a fool to fight me!
You're headed to Dawnstar.
You're headed to Markarth.
You're headed to Whiterun.
You're just getting older.
You're nothing but a joke!
You're out of your league!
You're ready to get going?
You're trying my patience.
You've breathed your last!
You've dug your own grave!
(coughing fit) Uuughhnnn...
[QUOTE]Our[QUOTE] business?
A peaceful greeting to you.
A pint of your finest mead.
A pleasant journey, milady.
A pleasant journey, milord.
Agh! Enough! This ends now!
All right, all right. Here.
All right. What next, then?
And so you shall be tested.
And they were no base prey.
And what about Jarl Elisif?
And what about Jarl Erikur?
And? Were they magnificent?
Another one for the Blades.
Are the gods angry with me?
Are we running low on mead?
Are you enjoying the party?
Arise! Arise and defend us!
As you say, it will happen.
At last, a worthy opponent!
Azura's Star is ours. Ours!
Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor.
Be careful who you talk to.
Because I'm telling you to.
Before the ancient flame...
Best luck I've had all day.
Blessings of Mara upon you!
Boziik, Dovahkiin. Nuz mey.
Brother? Is... Is that you?
But, there's one they fear.
By Azura, what's happening?
By the gods, a dragon! How?
By Ysmir! Nothing kills it!
Call... that... a... swing?
Can't a man drink in peace?
Certainly, good lady. Here.
Come back and see us again!
Come back and see us again.
Come on, he's not so tough.
Come... embrace your death!
Could that be... the Voice?
Could you please leave now?
Damn. That's quite a sight.
Damned good shooting, boys!
Did something happen to it?
Did you need anything else?
Did you use my good hammer?
Do not try to hide from me.
Do you think it's gone yet?
Does that cover everything?
Don't delay, Shield-Sister.
Don't get any bright ideas.
Don't let it get too close!
Don't run. Stay for dinner!
Don't sass me, little girl.
Dovahkiin los ok dovahkriid
Down with you, damned worm!
Even my claws feel sharper.
Even while making parts up.
Everyone talks, in the end.
Face me, then! Zu'u Alduin!
Feel free to make requests.
General Tullius, over here!
Get down to the front line.
Get out of my head, Daedra!
Get ready to open the trap!
Get that thing out of here!
Get these things off of me!
Get to the nearest way out!
Give me... just a moment...
Give them their last rites.
Go ahead, see for yourself.
Go, you're not wanted here.
Go. Do what has to be done.
Going to enjoy killing you!
Good friends and neighbors.
Good journey, marsh-friend.
Good luck on your next job.
Got my hands full as usual.
Got plenty, take your pick.
Got to be here somewhere...
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha! Don't make me laugh.
Ha ha! I've suffered worse!
Harpies, every one of them.
Have it your own way, meat.
Here, you should have this.
Hey, you. Stop right there!
Hey! Good to see you again.
Hey. You wanna play a game?
Hin sil fen nahkip bahloki.
Hmm. Gone. I don't like it.
Honest pay for honest work.
How are we doing over here?
How goes the investigation?
How long until they arrive?
How may I help you, my son?
How would you like a drink?
I am not yours to toy with!
I call upon you, Lady Mara!
I can still put up a fight!
I could sure use some coin.
I do. Still want to buy it?
I don't have time for this.
I don't know, I don't know!
I don't know, not for sure.
I expected better from you.
I guess you get used to it.
I love weddings, don't you?
I said get down there. Now.
I said, on your knees, Elf!
I showed up to watch, yeah.
I spit on you, dead sister.
I suppose that's yours now.
I will feast on your heart.
I won't take no for answer!
I'll be damned, you did it!
I'll carve you into pieces!
I'll gut you like a horker!
I'll hurt you if I have to.
I'll kill you if I have to!
I'll show you a real fight!
I'm not going to ask again.
I'm of a mind with Irileth.
I'm ready. More than ready.
I'm sure we'll speak again.
I've already said too much.
I've fought worse than you!
I've never been more ready!
I've never felt this brave.
I've said too much already.
Indeed. That would be best.
Interesting. Same dragon...
Is Hroggar innocent or not?
Is it information you want?
Is there someone out there?
Is Ulfric's armor done yet?
It all ends here, assassin!
It'll be there. You'll see.
It's magnificent, isn't it?
It's the escaped prisoners!
Just getting jumpy I guess.
Just like Ysgramor himself.
Just point me to the fight.
Keep your eyes to the road.
Keep your sword arm strong.
Lady Mara... preserve me...
Look at you, up to no good.
Look, it's all very simple.
Looks safe now. Let's move.
Madanach. The King in Rags.
Malacath witness our deeds.
Man gives bards a bad name.
May wisdom light your path.
May you walk on warm sands.
More rest will do you good.
My daughter! Dead! Noooooo!
Naked. Naked, naked, naked!
Need me to carry something?
Next, the Nord in the rags!
Nice shot! Right on target.
No problem, I'll handle it.
No problem! How can I help?
No, dear sister. We do not.
No, I... I submit. No more.
No, I... I was just asking.
No! I'm losing the binding.
No! That urn was priceless!
No! Wait! We're not rebels!
No. Gods no, not for years.
No... No, this cannot be...
Not a chance. Get'em, boys!
Not the sneaking type, huh?
Nothing Vulwulf.... cheers.
Now, we begin the ritual...
Of course they don't count!
Of course we did, icebrain.
Oh well. Must have run off.
Oh, did you need something?
Oh, hello! Just tidying up.
Oh, I didn't see you there.
Oh, well done. Very subtle.
Old ruins. Nordic, I think.
Out the way we came. Hurry!
Out with it. Time is money.
Patience, sister. Patience.
Please help. I can pay you.
Please, get me out of here!
Please, let me out of here!
Quickly, what did you want?
Ralof? How do you know him?
Represent us well, brother.
Revenge? How interesting...
Rip the eyes from her head!
Rip the eyes from his head!
She won't tell me her name.
Sigh. What is it now, dear?
Someone take out that mage!
Something I can get for ya?
Speak to me, Shield-Sister.
Stop bothering me Aicanter!
Such a kind nibble you are.
Sure, we can talk a minute.
Thank you. Do hurry please.
Thanks again for your help.
That's absurd. Come on now.
That's my brother up there.
That's what I like to hear.
That's what you always say.
The Miasma? But, brother...
The prisoners are escaping!
There is no more life here.
There it is!  On the table.
There's no reason to fight.
This is a good hiding spot.
This is exciting, isn't it?
This is simply fascinating.
This isn't about the money.
This place is unbelievable.
To what do I owe the honor?
Today is a good day to die.
Token, you say? Let me see.
Trouble is in the air here.
True Nords never back down!
Try and hit the far target.
Um... yes, of course, sir. 
Use both words, if you can.
Very well, I'll try milady.
Very well. Just be careful!
Victory is yours! I submit!
We follow you, hunt-master.
We fought them off, but... 
We must end the nightmares!
We must succeed here today.
We'll cross once it's safe.
We're with you, Dragonborn.
We've got to bring it down!
Well, not a great deal, no.
Werewolf! Kill the monster!
What are you doing in here?
What are you talking about?
What did you need, soldier?
What do you need, guardian?
What do you need, handsome?
What do you need, Listener?
What do you need, my Thane?
What do you need, stranger?
What do you want, Imperial?
What troubles you, darling?
What troubles you, husband?
What? No. Get away from me.
What? The Emperor? But I...
What...hey! That felt good.
What's the matter with you?
Who says I've settled down?
Why are you here, outsider?
Why don't you stay a while?
Why? Who says I have to be?
With pleasure, my Listener!
Wo meyz wah dii vul junaar?
Wonderful, dear. Thank you.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Yes, I hope this helps you.
You are ready to move, yes?
You can't get away from me!
You dare summon me, Yamarz?
You dirty, filching lizard!
You have my thanks, friend.
You heard the man, Tullius.
You look worse than I feel.
You must have a death wish.
You must leave immediately.
You pledge your soul to me?
You ready to take the Oath?
You return, foolish mortal?
You shoe that gelding, boy?
You think this is personal?
You want something from me?
You won't get away from me!
You won't leave here alive!
You won't like it, my lady.
You. You're coming with me.
You're all heart, Vivienne.
You're certain we're ready?
You're headed to Falkreath.
You're nothing but trouble.
You're serious, aren't you?
You've got moments to live.
You've left me no choice...
Your blood won't bother me!
Your death brings me honor!
A cave. Up for some hunting?
A new supplicant approaches.
A trick of the dark perhaps?
Ah well, it was a long shot.
Ah, yes. No fat on this one!
Alok, Nahagliiv. Tiid boaan.
An Orc follows to the death.
And another soul for Sithis.
And that's why I'm the best.
Another corpse for the pile.
Another day, another septim.
Another quiet day... I hope.
Another soul for the master!
Another thrall for the Void!
Anything else before you go?
Anything you need, Listener.
Are you looking for a fight?
Awww, well, maybe next time.
Back with good news I trust.
Because... I would miss you.
Beg for your miserable life!
Blacksmith, at your service.
Blessings of Talos upon you.
But I will heed your wishes.
But, if we found it first...
By Ysmir, Irileth was right!
By Ysmir! That's impressive.
Can't stop to chat, citizen.
Cicero bids you... farewell.
Clavicus sent you didn't he?
Come back if you need steel.
Come on, she's not so tough.
Come to gawk at the monster?
Consider it forgotten, boss.
Did he now? I can only hope.
Did you really see a dragon?
Did you see a Dog out there?
Didn't even work up a sweat.
Do you believe this old hag?
Do you like my pretty tower?
Don't delay, Shield-Brother.
Don't even talk to me, Gane.
Don't keep waiting, soldier.
Don't want to talk about it.
Don't you walk away from me!
Dragonborn... it's an honor.
Everyone please, stand back!
Exactly as I said it would. 
Extraordinary. I see it now.
For the glory of the Empire!
For the glory of the Empire.
Foreigners. What a nuisance!
Frida, you aren't saying....
Get him! Rip his throat out!
Give those pirates what for!
Give up while you still can!
Go ahead and play your joke.
Go home and lock your doors.
Good doin' business with ya.
Good observation. What else?
Good to see you. Come on in.
Good, we could use the coin.
Good. We should keep moving.
Gotta give the crowd a show.
Grow back that missing limb!
Guard. Prepare the prisoner.
Ha! I think you're bleeding!
Ha! Like the bite of a flea!
Hadvar? How do you know him?
Harrald, I have need of you.
Haven't you heard it by now?
He doesn't deserve to speak!
He must be here somewhere...
He wasn't protesting, Maven.
Here's where you need to go.
Hmm. Nothing here after all.
Honest gold for honest work.
Honestly. Have you any idea?
How could you do that to me!
How is the pain? Any better?
I can almost hear its heart.
I can't believe that worked!
I can't believe that worked.
I don't mean to confuse you.
I don't owe you money, do I?
I got nothing to say to you.
I have eternity to find you.
I have no business with you.
I hope you've got some coin.
I knew I could count on you.
I pray you're right, Legate.
I saw you do that, you know.
I suggest you aim elsewhere.
I suppose that's true. Fine.
I trust my parents are well?
I was hoping you'd say that.
I wish you the best of luck.
I would hope that's obvious.
I... I don't have any money.
I'd stay away if I were you.
I'll gladly kill you myself!
I'll meet you at the shrine.
I'll see you at our wedding!
I'm busy right now, Colette.
I'm busy, is this important?
I'm glad you're on our side.
I'm going to check that out.
I'm just doing my duty, sir.
I'm not taking any visitors.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm on duty.
I'm trying to pay attention.
I've been hurt worse before.
I've got to get out of here!
I've got to get out of here.
I've really got to be going.
If I can just... stand up...
If you go to him, good luck.
Impressive. Damn impressive.
Is anyone out there? Anyone?
Is everything well, Nelacar?
Is that the best you can do?
It worked, then? Let me see!
It's not true, I assure you.
It's over. No more violence.
It's still here! Get it out!
Just another minute, please.
Just give up! You can't win!
Just say the word, mistress.
Keep your hands to yourself.
Lead on to Sky Haven Temple.
Let's just take a look then.
Let's make the bastards pay.
Like you won't do different?
Live for thousands of years!
Look out! The wolf is loose!
Look what you've made me do!
Looking for a place to stay?
M'aiq knows many things, no?
Mage up there! In the tower!
Mara forgives you, my child.
May Talos guide you. Always.
Mjoll! I'm glad I found you.
My blade is yours once more.
My thanks. I feel... better.
Namira covets your ugliness.
Next Imperial I see is dead.
No going back that way, now.
No Mulush. I'll work harder.
No, no. Just watch over him.
No, not at all. It's just...
No! Someone help me! Please!
Not for you. Not for anyone.
Not right now. Anything new?
Nothing, you pig-headed oaf!
Now go, leave me to my work.
Now, you just stand there...
Oh no, that's not it at all.
Oh no... what happened here?
Oh, by the Divines, you too?
Oh, I do not approve at all.
Oh... well. Never mind then.
Okay, now don't move at all.
Ooh! Listener! That tickles!
Please, sir, leave me alone!
Please! Don't hurt me again!
Please. You first. I insist.
Plenty of fresh fish for ya.
Pray to your gods for mercy!
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Razelan. What are you doing?
Ready to practice some more?
Remember Cloud Ruler Temple!
Sahloknir, krii daar joorre.
Save it for the battlefield.
Say hello to Verulus for me.
Shhh. You'll scare the deer.
Shor's bones, here he comes!
Sit back and enjoy the ride.
Skaggi is in charge, not me.
Skyrim belongs to the Nords!
Slow, but looking good, sir.
So he has talked! I knew it!
So it wasn't my imagination.
So this is your plan, Lucan?
So what do you want to know?
Some day, brother. Some day.
Some layabout named Sabjorn.
Someone's going to get hurt.
Something I can get for you?
Soon. I can almost taste it.
Speak to me, Shield-Brother.
Speak to Styrr. He can help.
Stay out of trouble, lizard.
Stop it! I don't like magic.
Suddenly I feel much better.
Sure it is, Lod. Sure it is.
Sure, what can I do for you?
Sure, whatever you say. Bye.
Surrender or die, outlander!
Take care with those flames.
Take heed! They've awakened!
Thank you for your kindness.
Thank you, sir. Go right in.
Thanks for wasting my time. 
That can't be a coincidence.
That was a good bit of work.
That would probably be best.
That's the best I can offer.
That's the end of that, hmm?
That's the spirit! Let's go.
The Arch-Mage is dead! Dead!
The conquering hero returns!
The Emperor can kiss my ass!
The shadows have failed you!
Then I have no work for you.
Then I was wrong about him. 
Then you leave me no choice!
There could be no other end.
There it is. Ah.... Home....
There's a... A problem, yes.
They were smaller back then.
Think you can steal from me?
This is just like old times.
This is not J'zargo's fault!
Those words have such power!
Try and hit the left target.
Try not to get carried away.
Ugh, this place... horrible.
Ulfric will know my meaning.
We have to get the Key back.
We will find her eventually.
We're through! Keep at them!
We've had the same troubles.
Welcome to Dead Man's Drink.
Well done, well done indeed!
Well done. Here's your gold.
Well then, consider it done.
Well would you look at that!
Well, here we are. We think.
Well, I... If you're sure...
Well, isn't this a surprise!
Well, that's interesting....
Well, then. Repeat after me.
Well, what news? Is Alain...
Well? What's it going to be?
What are you doing that for?
What are you hiding, priest?
What can I get for you, sir?
What do you need, my friend?
What do you want, new blood?
What is the meaning of this?
What matters is their heart.
What should we have tonight?
What sort of power was that?
What was that thing, anyway?
What? The bo... Oh. Oh dear.
What? Why you lookin' at me?
What's happened? He's not...
When do I get to go hunting?
Who are you? Where's Gavros?
Why are we doing this again?
Why can't I train with Aela?
Why did Boti send you to me?
Why you still starin' at me?
Why, this is utterly unique.
With me, prisoner. Let's go!
Wow! Look at all the colors!
Wow. Would you look at that.
Yeah, take care of yourself.
Yes, what about Jarl Erikur?
Yes, youngling. Have a seat.
You brought this on us! You!
You call yourself a warrior?
You control nothing, mortal!
You go on your way now, boy.
You had your chance to talk!
You lookin' for a new blade?
You ready to die today? Huh?
You think I'm afraid of you?
You, of all people. Get out!
You! Come on, into the keep!
You'll die this day, dragon!
You'll make a fine rug, cat!
You'll never leave Markarth!
You'll serve me soon enough.
You're going to Fort Kastav.
You're going to regret this.
You're headed to Winterhold.
You're just rotten. No good.
You're making this too easy!
You're not going to kill me!
You're not welcome here. Go.
Your kind has no place here!
(Heavy breathing - sprinting)
A crown doesn't make a king. 
A risky game to play, friend.
A stranger comes to our hall.
Agreed. We all stay together.
Ah, indeed I do! Indeed I do!
Ah. Some other time, perhaps?
Ahhh... It's good to be home.
All right, whatever you want.
All right, you've had enough.
All right. What's your fancy?
All we can do now is rebuild.
Almost there! We're so close!
Alok, Viinturuth. Tiid boaan.
Alok, Vuljotnaak. Tiid boaan.
An intruder in the Sepulcher!
And now, to deliver a speech.
And they say romance is dead.
And what did you say to that?
And what might you need? Hmm?
Another day, another victory.
Another soul for you, Father!
Any luck finding the Butcher?
Are you the one sent by Mara?
As for what she might like...
Ataf keeps making eyes at me.
Because she was being stupid!
Blessings upon you, traveler.
By Sithis, I'll see you dead!
By Sithis, you're not joking.
By the gods... what was that?
By the Hist, what a sight....
Certainly, my good man. Here.
Clanfolk, stop the outlander!
Come on. Sounds like trouble.
Come to gawk at the dark elf?
Come to gawk at the Dark Elf?
Damn it, this will not stand!
Did Ri'saad accept our offer?
Divines smile on you, friend.
Do the bees need to be happy?
Do you have Gallus's Journal?
Don't like the looks of this.
Dragonborn. What do you need?
Elisif! I said I'd handle it.
Enough games, let's end this!
Esbern cannot elude us, fool.
Feel the Benevolence of Mara!
Feel the thunder of my voice!
Find anything worthwhile yet?
Follow the Captain, prisoner.
For Whiterun! For the Empire!
Glory to the Empress of Murk!
Go ahead, try and fight back!
Go down already, you bastard!
Go! We'll follow when we can!
Gods, this is hers, isn't it?
Good. I can use the practice.
Good. I'm ready for anything.
Good. Perhaps I've misjudged.
Got more than you can handle.
Got of lot of steel to shape.
Grelka, can you repair boots?
Ha ha! Look out. Here I come!
Halt in the name of the Jarl!
Have you killed them all yet?
He made it safe for our kind.
Here, it's all I can spare...
Here. I hope you choke on it.
Here's your share. Well done.
Hey gossip, bring me a drink.
Hey, can I get a gold or two?
Hey, no fair! Get her, Stump!
Hey! Watch what you're doing.
Hiding will not save you now.
Hmm, nothing there after all.
Hope I don't draw guard duty.
How goes the hunting, sister?
How long can we keep this up?
How may I serve the Listener?
Hrongar will know my meaning.
Humble Cicero lives to serve.
Humph. Some daughter you are.
Hush, Salma. We aren't alone.
I am the shadow at your back.
I am Uglarz, huntress of all.
I can teach you a few things.
I can't believe I got caught.
I can't wait to be invisible.
I do not fear you, Dovahkiin!
I don't have anything to say.
I gave them no such pleasure.
I guess you had your reasons.
I have a letter here for you.
I hope there aren't any more.
I hope to see you again soon.
I knew you'd come eventually.
I know you're here somewhere.
I know, I know. I'm hurrying.
I long to taste battle again.
I love this part of the meal.
I merely wish to talk to you.
I need some more ale, Orgnar.
I really don't want to fight.
I surrender... I surrender...
I think I know, but go ahead.
I think it's time to leave...
I think they got the message.
I trust everything went well?
I want vengeance for my wife!
I was just getting warmed up.
I was sure I heard something.
I wasn't looking for trouble.
I will see you dead, monster.
I wish I could go with you...
I wish someone would find me.
I work steel, weapons mostly.
I'll begin searching up here.
I'll end your miserable life!
I'll let you live. This time.
I'll let you stay. This time.
I'll see you dead and buried!
I'll try and make this quick!
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm bleeding! Ha ha ha ha ha!
I'm bored! Let's play a game!
I'm getting too old for this.
I'm going to... put you down!
I'm in a bit of trouble here.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
I'm just itching for a fight.
I'm so close to the answer...
I'm sure I heard something...
I've got some salmon to sell.
I've killed legions like you!
If you want to die, so be it.
In fact, who are you, anyway?
Indeed. If we ever get there.
Is it? This is disappointing.
Is that one of the old ruins?
Is the new shaft cleared yet?
It cannot... end like this...
It is? Well that's different.
It was a pleasure, thank you.
It'll make for a better song.
It's about time you got here.
It's been an honor, guardian.
It's good to be mining again.
It's kind of an amusing tale.
It's not much, but we get by.
Just one right now, actually.
Karliah... she's still alive?
Keep following, it isn't far.
Keep that magic away from me.
Keep your eyes and ears open.
Keep yourself safe, traveler.
Last but not least. Let's go!
Let me tell you how I see it.
Let's get this party started.
Like... with the little girl.
Listen, we're friends, right?
Look at the young ones scrap!
Looks like it's my lucky day.
Looks to be another cold day.
Master, look. It's the Phial.
May Hircine guide our blades.
May prosperity bless us both!
May the gods preserve us all.
Maybe. Let me think about it.
Mercer's here. I can feel it.
My, my. What do we have here?
Need to get back to chopping.
Never mind, I'm dead already-
No! You're going to break it!
Nobody we know, by the smell.
Nordic ruins. Old. Secretive.
Not without a fight it isn't!
Oh my word, this is terrible.
Oh, half the field should do.
Oh, I can smell your blood...
Oh! Yes, but of course. Ahem.
Oh. Is it your... first time?
Only twenty septims a bottle!
Only use the practice arrows.
Onward to our next adventure!
Open to the will of Septimus!
Pathetic excuse for an elf...
Petra! Petra! Curse her eyes!
Please help me, I'm starving.
Please, someone do something!
Put that down, you mangy cat!
Safe journeys, sword-brother.
Say you're sorry. Say it now.
She can't tell me what to do!
She will certainly be missed.
She's dead. Laelette is dead.
Show us the path to the prey.
So cold, so hungry, so tired.
So I'm told. Try and keep up.
So they don't like us either.
So, has my bow turned up yet?
Something doesn't feel right.
Sometimes cargo goes missing.
Sound like you can handle it?
Stab you, stab you, stab you!
Stay out of trouble, Khajiit.
Still you persist? Very well.
Stormcloaks! Filthy traitors!
Strangers are always trouble.
Take this with our gratitude.
Talos save us! It's a dragon!
Teach them to stop paying me.
Thank you for coming, sister.
Thank you for sticking by me.
Thank you for your patronage.
Thank you, I thought so, too.
Thanks again for the legwork.
That doesn't change anything.
That is none of your concern.
That put a spring in my step.
That seems to be all of them.
That should do it. After you.
That sound... it's deafening!
That spell looks dangerous...
That's how the Legion fights.
The Bloodmoon lights the way.
The fever... my body burns...
The finest weapons and armor.
The mine is closed. Get lost.
The Reach will be ours again.
The staff! Use it on the Eye!
The Thalmor's memory is long.
The Word calls you. Go to it.
Then what are you doing here?
There is no news, I'm afraid.
There is no pain in the Void!
They'll never see you coming.
This had better be important.
This is the Skyrim you want?!
This is unfair! I'm innocent!
This place will be your tomb!
This way everyone! Over here!
This'll just take a moment...
Time to end this little game!
Try and hit the right target.
Ugh! That it? That your best?
Unslaad hokoron! Never again!
Uuuuhhhnnnn... aaarrrghhh....
Wait a moment... what's that?
Wasn't your business, anyway.
Watch that tongue, new blood.
We are in this together, yes?
We knew you'd be coming here.
We won't return empty handed.
We... don't have enough to...
We'd best be careful in here.
We're going to make them pay.
We've got to get inside. Now!
We've got to get out of here.
Well, I guess you'll have to.
Well, look what we have here.
What are you doing down here?
What are you waiting for? Go!
What do you need, Dragonborn?
What do you want me to carry?
What do you want, beef roast?
What do you want, little elf?
What manner of magic is this?
What? By the gods, Betrid....
What? What is it now, mother?
What's that supposed to mean?
When I find you, you're dead.
When you get it, she's yours.
Yes - don't kill the Gourmet!
Yes, but it's no easy matter.
Yes, I'm ready to do my part.
Yes, Nightingale, what is it?
You brought this on yourself!
You can't just leave me here!
You dare dishonor the Legion?
You dare to betray us, Illia?
You first. Come on. Let's go.
You go on your way now, girl.
You have a problem with that?
You have? Where? Tell me now!
You learn quickly. Once more.
You think you stand a chance?
You visit us often, Thadgeir.
You want a fight? You got it.
You want to talk to me? Okay.
You watch yourself out there.
You won't get away with that!
You won't get the best of me!
You won't leave Helgen alive!
You won't leave Skyrim alive!
You're a slave. Just like us.
You're going to Fort Dunstad.
You're going to Fort Neugrad.
You're going to Fort Sungard.
You're headed to the capital.
You're smarter than you look.
You've been warned, outsider.
You've come for me, have you?
You've got sixty seconds. Go.
...but only during... the day?
[QUOTE]Sir[QUOTE]? How quaint.
A new hand touches the beacon.
A round for all of my friends!
A traitor right up to the end.
Actually... I do. Little joke.
All right. I'll see you there.
Always glad to talk to a bard.
Always time for a fellow bard.
Amativ! Mu bo kotin stinselok.
And killed them. In his honor.
And this... This is all wrong.
And what makes you think that?
And what would you have me do?
And... you'll take care of it?
Another day in this graveyard.
Another new Apprentice, I see.
Anyone else feel like running?
Anything else you want to say?
Anything for my favorite lass.
Archers. Behind those windows!
Are we writing a letter, Lord?
Are you hurt? What's happened?
Are you playing hide and seek?
Avulstein... you stupid boy...
Aye, you've got a point there.
Azura's wisdom to you, friend.
Balgruuf will know my meaning.
Become one with the Evergloam!
Better in here than out there.
Bothela, I have a question....
Burn that little jester alive.
But that day has not come yet.
By the gods! Somebody help me!
By Ysmir, you'll pay for that!
Can't wait to get out of here.
Come on, Beem-Ja. We're going.
Come on, soldier. Keep moving!
Come out! We know you're here!
Conquer your enemies, my love.
Coward. Come out and fight me!
Damnit! This isn't about gold!
Damnit. What's he waiting for?
Did you clean the linens, yet?
Did you learn anything useful?
Didn't think you had the coin.
Do you need anything, my love?
Do you wish to become a Blade?
Don't leave any of them alive.
Don't leave poor Melka to die.
Don't worry about it. Keep it.
Don't you ever wonder, father?
Draw your last breath, mortal!
Empire loves their damn lists.
Enough games, face your death!
Excellent. Show them no mercy.
Feels good to be mining again.
Fen du hin sille ko Sovngarde!
Finally, we have an agreement.
Fool! None may know my secret!
Get moving, now. I'll be fine.
Get the coat. Then we'll talk.
Go on ahead. I'll stand guard.
Good job. Take this in return.
Good luck with that Icewraith.
Good man. You won't regret it.
Good to see you again, friend.
Good. And his Writ of Passage?
Grace of Kynareth be with you.
Great. What do you want to do?
Ha! You can't resist, can you?
Hadvar... get away from there!
Have you reconsidered my idea?
Haven't heard from him since. 
He he he he he he he he he he.
He might not devour you whole.
He's got to be here somewhere.
Here you go, for your trouble.
Here, a reward from your Jarl.
Here. I want you to have this.
Here's your gold, as promised.
Hey, that's a valuable animal!
Hey, you don't look so good...
Hey... is someone watching me?
Hi, Marise. How are you today?
Hmm. That doesn't go anywhere.
Hmph. Good. That'll teach 'em.
Hmph. That remains to be seen.
Hold, mage, and listen well...
How can I help a brother Nord?
How does it move so damn fast?
How goes the hunting, brother?
How have things been with you?
Hurt him while he is grounded!
Hush now. Think no more of it.
I am not your plaything, worm!
I am waiting for a good death.
I bet she'll talk to you, too.
I can always use the practice.
I can hear your heart beating.
I don't care, a deal's a deal.
I don't think you belong here.
I don't want to be hurt again!
I don't want to talk about it.
I feel a change in the room...
I feel like I can beat anyone.
I have something to say first.
I heard about what happened...
I hope we reach Markarth soon.
I knew it! Let me see, please!
I know, I was late. I'm sorry.
I must've been hearing things.
I saw it first! I'm taking it.
I suppose thanks are in order.
I thank you for your courtesy.
I think I'll like living here.
I want every arrow in the sky!
I'll be here when you're done.
I'll kill you where you stand!
I'll mark it down on your map.
I'll meet you outside of town.
I'll rip you apart, Companion!
I'm being as careful as I can.
I'm here! I knew I'd find you!
I'm promoting you to Quaestor.
I'm sorry, but I really can't.
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm on duty.
I'm sorry, that can't be done.
I've outlived worse than this!
If that's the way you want it.
Is it that time again already?
It seems those tales are true.
It's been good talking to you.
It's like it was in my dreams.
It's so good to see you again.
It's the waiting that gets me.
Jarl Elisif, I'll handle this.
Just close the door, will you?
Just walk towards me, come on!
Lead, then. You have my steel.
Leave me be. I'm no harm here.
Let 'em go, Hewnon. All clear.
Let me know when you're ready.
Let me put it to you this way.
Let's just get this over with.
Let's just not be too obvious.
Let's sate that appetite, hmm?
Let's test that out some time.
Look out! Don't get too close!
Looking to practice, stranger?
Looks like you had no trouble.
Magic! I'm not sure I approve.
May Azura's magic protect you.
Maybe it would. If you had it.
Maybe it's time you quit then.
Maybe one day, just not today.
Mind's playing tricks on me...
Morvath will taste your blood!
Need a room, talk to Delphine.
Need to get going. What is it?
Never should have come here...
Next time, deal with Avenicci.
No, and I'm not expecting any.
No, no! This is the wrong way!
No! You will not deny me this!
Now everyone get back to work.
Now please, no more questions.
Now you're just making me mad.
Of course. Take what you need.
Oh come on, I ain't that dumb.
Oh, he's serious. But so am I.
Oh, now, that can't be good...
Oh, this is going to be great!
Oho, so that's where you went.
OK, let's see what you can do.
Okay, got another one for you.
Okay, okay. I'll deal with it.
One down, my friend. One down.
Oooh, wonderful! I can't wait!
Papa, I want to talk to you...
Pay your dues and we'll speak.
Pfft. Ungrateful milk drinker.
Please, get word to my mother.
Please, let's speak privately.
Please, make yourself at home!
Razelan. What is it this time?
Right, I really am busy. So...
Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
Seems no one in this city has.
So he might still be in there?
Some folk - they got no shame.
Spare some gold for a veteran?
Spiced Wine to warm the blood!
Stay out of trouble, Argonian.
Stay out of trouble, Imperial.
Stay out of trouble, Redguard.
Still have something you need?
Still need me to do something?
Stop, in the name of the Jarl!
Suit yourself. Get 'em Hewnon!
Thank the Divines! Let's move!
Thank you for coming, brother.
Thank you, ma'am. Go right in.
Thank you. The Eight keep you.
Thanks, Aia. That means a lot.
That is rich. What did she do?
That was hardly worth my time.
That'll teach you to cross me.
That's how a true Nord fights.
That's it, son. Make me proud.
That's it. Keep hacking at it.
The glimmer of life is gone...
The museum is opening, Madena.
The new meat. So soft. Tender.
The old gods give me strength!
The road makes this one weary.
The shadows have betrayed you!
The what of what? No. No idea.
Then it's settled. You and me.
There is no help for you here.
They are good, loyal children.
This has ruined my entire day.
This is it! Gathrik awaits us!
This is no time for idle talk.
This is our stronghold. Leave.
This is what I've trained for!
This was your crazy idea, huh?
Tomorrow. Same time as before.
Traitors. Traitors all of you!
Try and hit the middle target.
Twelve septims on the big one!
Very well. I am poorer for it.
Vex! Put it away... right now.
Wait. You there. Step forward.
Wait... who are you? Intruder!
Wait... who in blazes is this?
We meet at last, my dear lady.
We should really get to court.
We should talk again sometime.
We'll chat after the ceremony.
We'll meet up near Karthspire.
Well aren't you a strange one.
Well, there's this boy, and...
Well? What are we waiting for?
What are you up to, Gane? Hmm?
What can I get for you, ma'am?
What do you want from me, now?
What in Arkay's name was that?
What is it you seek, my child?
What is that supposed to mean?
What is your need, Dragonborn?
What will you do now, my love?
What?  My Fjola would never...
What? Well - what did she say?
What? What are you looking at?
What? Who is the Night Mother?
What? You stupid or something?
What's happening to this city?
Whatever I don't already know.
Who are you? What do you want?
Who could tell the difference?
Who were you fighting against?
Why are you people doing this?
Yeah, you said that yesterday.
Yes, let's get this over with.
Yes, the staff. Interesting...
Yes? What is it that you want?
Yes. Further. Into the bowels.
You always were a quick study.
You appear ready for the Oath.
You are no match for me, joor!
You expect me to believe that?
You have an Elder Scroll? You?
You have heard of the Gourmet?
You have the gold yet or what?
You have the look of a killer.
You have your orders, soldier.
You little wretch, I saw that!
You plan to march on Windhelm?
You there! What are you doing?
You want another one of those?
You! Don't hurt me! Not again!
You. Weapon. Put it away. Now.
You'll have a traitor's death.
You'll have to catch me first!
You'll pay for your blasphemy!
You're going to Fort Greymoor.
You're going to Fort Snowhawk.
You're right. We're not alone.
You've been kind, I thank you.
You've got to help me! Please!
Your blood is ours, Companion!
Your death will be my triumph!
Your objective is Fort Kastav.
Zu'u unslaad! Zu'u nis oblaan!
A Dreth never forgets a friend.
A shame it had to come to that.
Ah, Olfina. How may I help you?
Ah, that is good to hear, then.
Ah, yes. True. Well, thank you.
Ah! What did you do? Stop that!
All right, let's not overdo it.
All right. Don't take too long.
All right. Let's take a look...
And there is... no... Listener!
And what's wrong with him, huh?
Anything you need, just holler.
Are you trying? 'Cause I'm not.
Arkay keep you and protect you.
Bassianus, sweetie, what is it?
Be prepared to defend yourself.
Because Ulfric needed a symbol.
Blessings of Arkay be upon you.
Brilliant, I know. It's a gift.
Brynjolf sent you to rub it in?
But we choose our own path now.
By the gods, is that the Voice?
By the gods! It... it can't be!
By Ysmir, I feel... invincible!
Can I buy you a drink, darling?
Can I make something now, papa?
Can't talk.... I'm outta' here.
Climb in back and we'll be off.
Come on! We need to get inside!
Come, taste darkness's embrace!
Consider the suspension lifted.
Do this, and I shall favor you.
Do you have news of our quarry?
Do you have the Eldergleam sap?
Do you remember me now, Hjalti?
Do you seek to make a purchase?
Don't be. We all make mistakes.
Don't come too close with that.
Don't say words you don't mean.
Don't worry. I'll play my part.
Draugr are below. Foul tasting.
Enough of this mindless banter!
Falk said I could count on you.
Fall before the will of Sithis!
Fine. Let's get this over with.
First, you must open this door.
Glad that distraction's over...
Glory in battle, honor in life.
Good day, friend! Keeping well?
Good luck. I'm counting on you.
Good. Let's get this over with.
Good... here's your assignment.
Goodness, that's it, isn't it?!
Gotta admit, that's impressive.
Guess it was nothing after all.
Ha ha ha ha! No! Never find me!
Hands off. That's my armor now!
Hands to yourself, sneak thief.
Have you always been that ugly?
Have you spoken to Fastred yet?
Haven't seen her around before.
Haven't seen him around before.
Hello Bolli. How's the fishing?
Hello, husband. You slept well?
Help! Someone's being attacked!
Here's the gold for it. Thanks.
Here's your share. Nicely done.
Hey, you. You're finally awake.
Hey! Those belong to my family!
Hey! What're you doing in here?
Hmph. Damn you for being right.
How is your hunting with Yatul?
How long are you going to wait?
How will I know when I'm ready?
How's it coming there, Jawanan?
Huh? What...oh! That felt nice.
I am done with you. You may go.
I bring death from the shadows!
I can. It might save your life.
I can't think of anyone better.
I count my blessings every day.
I don't buy that story, either.
I don't know. He never told me.
I don't need luck, I need rest.
I had no choice, don't you see?
I have no words. Talk to Anwen.
I haven't even said what it is.
I hope you've readied yourself.
I long to fight that foul worm.
I need some help with this one!
I presume you're talking to me?
I thank you for your kindness. 
I want to be on the right side.
I will be Jarl someday, mother?
I'd simply like to talk to you.
I'll live to drink another day!
I'll raise a cup to your grave!
I'll see you back in Riverwood.
I'll tear out your heart first!
I'm fine, father. Work is fine.
I'm glad it was you and not me.
I'm glad to help any way I can.
I'm not kidding. I'll hurt you!
I'm not sure where else I'd go.
I'm sorry lass, I... I can't...
I've got some fight left in me!
Indeed.  Alduin wahlaan daanii.
Is he... sifting through trash?
It is our most favored company.
It pleases me to see you again.
It's not you I'm worried about.
It's pleasing to see you again.
It's so nice to have a visitor.
It's the Imperials! Take cover!
It's time you learned a lesson.
Just never you mind about that.
Just shut up and play the game.
Lady Maven, how may I help you?
Lead on, to Ysgramor and glory.
Lead with those arrows, dammit!
Let me know when you are, then.
Look at that edge. Still sharp.
Look, here. In the third panel.
Look! Up on the wall. A wizard!
Mama, when is Cade coming home?
Mara can't help me. No one can.
Meet us here when you're ready.
Nahagliiv! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
Nice job hitting those targets.
Nice touch about the High King.
Nicely done. Here's your share.
No escape this time, foul worm!
No man is a match for a dragon.
No time to talk. Out of my way.
No, Igmund. It's too dangerous.
No, no. Well, I don't think so.
No! Oh, by the gods, please no!
No! You'll never take me alive!
Not now. I'm too upset to talk.
Not quite good enough, are you?
Nothing else? I'm always eager.
Now hit the target to the left.
Now I have some time to kill...
Now is not the time for talk...
Now, do you require assistance?
Oh. Yes. You all look the same.
Oho! And what do you want, hmm?
Outsiders. Nothing but trouble.
Perhaps one day, but not today.
Pleasant weather for a war, no?
Please, you have to believe me!
Please... don't break my wares!
Pray to Stendarr while you can!
Pretty good arm you have there.
Really? And what might that be?
Really? He's safe? Where is he?
Remember to give at the temple.
Sahloknir! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
Sheathe those claws, Khajiit...
Silence, traitor! Move. Slowly.
So be it. We gave you a choice.
So I'll cut right to the chase.
So you do have something, then.
So, what can I do for ya today?
So, you're the new recruit, eh?
Soft. Just like all outlanders.
Stay out of trouble in my city.
Steady. Let's see what it does.
Stew again, papa? I want steak.
Still no word from your family?
Such an abrupt end to our game.
Suit yourself. I'm always here.
Suit yourself. You're the boss.
Thane Bryling, at your service.
Thanks Nana. I feel better now.
Thanks! Here - this is for you.
Thanks. I'll be waiting for it.
That a boy. You're doing great.
That's better. Now we can talk.
The burden of death approaches!
The chests of gold didn't hurt.
The gods know what you've done.
The Vigil will be watching you.
Their disappearance, of course!
Then I don't have time for you.
There's a way out through here!
There's two more of them ahead.
They have families to think of.
They're hurt, but they'll live.
This is an utter waste of time.
This is not over, I assure you.
This is worse than I thought...
This Khajiit guards the others.
This was worth coming back for.
Though, admittedly... it helps.
Try it again. Breath and focus.
Turn back! Before he finds you!
Typical Nord. Beard for brains.
Up through the tower, let's go!
Very well. I'll meet you there.
Wanted to say something to you.
We are done talking about this.
We were told you may be coming.
We will endure. We always have.
We'll see about that, won't we?
We're getting out of here. Now.
Well now, this is unexpected...
Well now. Funny you should ask.
Well, for the thrill of course.
Well, soldier? Can you do this?
Well? What word of the Emperor?
What are you in for, new blood?
What can I get you? Mead? Wine?
What can't you get me, sweetie?
What do you think you're doing?
What do you want, milk drinker?
What hole did you crawl out of?
What in the nine holds is that?
What troubles you, my daughter?
What? How did you get this far?
What? Oh, nothing. All is well.
What's left of Skyrim to wager?
Whenever you're ready to leave.
Where are you going? Come back!
Where do they keep coming from?
Why are we bothering with this?
Why are you standing here then?
Wow! That was fun. Do it again!
Yes, a Grand one. Soon, please.
Yes, my friend? How may I help?
Yes, my love? What do you need?
Yes. These are Akaviri symbols.
You can't hide from me forever.
You can't hide from the hidden.
You dare invade this Sanctuary?
You dare try and steal from me?
You don't have to tell me that.
You don't mean, a real, live...
You forget yourself, young one.
You know, I think you're right.
You need some armor, outlander?
You need to learn some manners!
You only use the little swords.
You people and your damn Jarls.
You should respect your elders!
You speak in riddles sometimes.
You still wish something of me?
You take care of yourself, now.
You treat us fairly. Thank you.
You will pay for your defiance!
You wish to trade in Orc steel?
You won't get that lucky again!
You won't live to see tomorrow!
You... Really? An Elder Scroll?
You.... You'll pay for this....
You'd do well to remember that.
You'll have to fight me for it.
You'll have to take it from me.
You're a cold, unfeeling bitch.
You're a firebrand, aren't you?
You're a stranger here too, eh?
You're also free to die for it.
You're certain you've found it?
You're going to Fort Greenwall.
You're going to get it, Sissel!
You're not as dumb as you look.
You're trying my patience, lad.
Your blood will adorn my blade!
Your objective is Fort Dunstad.
Your objective is Fort Neugrad.
Your objective is Fort Sungard.
Your payment, as per the usual.
Your presence will be revealed.
Your trickery won't confuse me!
Ah, it's my love, come to visit.
Ah. I have expected you. Prodah.
All right. I'll take care of it.
And I wasn't stuttering. No key.
And you'll be trampled to death!
Another foul day at the smelter.
Are you all right? Can you walk?
Are you in some kind of trouble?
Are you prepared for your death?
Are you ready to face the Guild?
As much as can be expected, yes.
Assassins? No, nothing so crass.
Battle-Born! Give me your money!
Better down here than out there.
Better not set anything on fire.
Bloody enough for you, outsider?
Bolar, I must ask you something.
But just think of the advantage.
Come Galmar, we have much to do.
Come here. Let me see your face.
Come on, give it your best shot!
Come on, we'd better get moving.
Come on, you're not even trying!
Come, help me search for Fenrig.
coughing- no subtitles displayed
Couldn't ask for better weather.
Coward. You're nothing. Nothing!
Damn Elves! You'll pay for this!
Damn it! There's no way through.
Damn it. No going back that way.
Did Viola send you to bother me?
Did you find all of the vessels?
Did you need something, Colette?
Do not cross the bridge unaided!
Do you bring word from Malacath?
Either you're lying to me, or...
Enough talk. There's much to do.
Esbern. What are you getting at?
Everyone, fall back! Run for it!
Find... Paratus... in Oculory...
Fjotra, dear. Did they hurt you?
Get those documents to Whiterun.
Go away! This is my wreck! Mine!
Good luck finding the fragments.
Good to meet a prospective Bard.
Grab what you can, and let's go.
Grunt reaction, done as a zombie
Ha! I knew it was you all along.
Ha! You can never truly stop me!
He did? That's... I'm surprised.
He didn't need to pick the lock.
He has given up. But I have not.
He's lonely. What do you expect?
Hey you! Let me out! I can help!
Hmm. Caves. Wonder what's below.
Hold on, now, we only want to...
Hold your fire until he's close!
How are your chores coming, son?
How may I help you, my daughter?
Hroggar's fate is in your hands.
Husband. Let him tell his story.
I ain't lookin' to make friends.
I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak...
I am Tsun, shield-thane to Shor.
I am your sword and your shield.
I appreciate the thought though.
I ask only for a little charity.
I bet my papa could beat you up.
I can't believe I'm still alive.
I can't believe you came for me!
I claim your soul for Nocturnal!
I could use some help over here!
I don't want to fight you again.
I feel like I can beat anything.
I found you! Na na na, na na na!
I have plenty of room in my bed.
I have several elixirs for sale.
I hear you've been busy of late.
I hope you're enjoying yourself.
I just want to go home and read.
I need some things for the ship.
I need you to retrieve the poem.
I owe you some answers, don't I?
I think this might be the end...
I think you're looking for this.
I told you, it's from my family.
I was hoping you would say that.
I will be waiting at Reachcliff.
I won't do it. You ask too much.
I... I don't know. What's wrong?
I'll find that Elf. I always do.
I'll mount your head on my wall!
I'll see you again soon, I hope.
I'm a true Nord. Simple as that.
I'm a warrior, not a blacksmith.
I'm afraid it's not that simple.
I'm as ready as I'm going to be.
I'm commander of the guard, now.
I'm heading home if you need me.
I'm just as puzzled as you, lad.
I'm not going to warn you again.
I'm trying to speak to the Jarl.
I've failed you... forgive me...
I've got some wonderful jewelry.
I've got your back, don't worry.
I've still got some fight in me!
If it isn't Ice-Veins. Hi there.
If only we knew where she was...
If this is somehow your fault...
Is she... sifting through trash?
Is there something I do for you?
Is this your best effort? Again.
It certainly is. Was, I suppose.
It should put on some coverings.
It's a fine day with you around.
It's Mercer! Look... down there!
It's my hope that you will, yes.
It's off to Cidhna Mine for you.
It's okay, mother. I understand.
It's you! Please, don't hurt me!
Just a little one! I was hungry!
Just give the General some time!
Keep it up and you'll go places.
Khajiit walks in your footsteps.
Let me give you a bit of advice.
Live a life worth telling about.
Look... Now's not a good time...
Looks like that's it. Got to go.
Looks like we're on our own now.
Maven sends her regards Letrush.
Mercer never told you about her?
Money, if that is what you wish.
Move along. Nothing to see here.
Must still be here, somewhere...
My blade thirsts for your blood!
My parents are being impossible.
Namira watch over you, champion.
Never thought I'd see you again.
No, I don't think so. Not today.
No, no! This can't be happening!
No? Very well, it's your choice.
No... not when we're so close...
Normally, a period of servitude.
Not when there's so much to see!
Now tell me where my brother is!
Now you're speaking my language.
Now, back to the matter at hand.
Now, if, um... you'll get going?
Now, now... no need for weapons.
Now, you go about your business.
Of course, Listener. What is it?
Oh yes! Dragonborn! Indeed, yes.
Oh, come now. Don't go away mad.
Oh, I see. Is it still too soon?
Oh, wait... it gets much better.
Oh, what a clever thief you are.
Oh. Oh-no. This won't do at all.
Okay. Well. That's all I've got.
Please proceed into the Embassy.
Please, stop! I'll pay! Take it!
Please. Please just let me be...
Pull up a seat and have a drink.
Put that thing away, or get out.
Remember, keep this to yourself.
Remind me not to make you angry.
Rrrrrraaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!
Savos. Before... before he died.
See if you can unlock that door.
She cannot hide from us forever.
She'll make a fine wife someday.
Skyrim has no use for your kind.
So close. Your prize is waiting.
So you can be helpful sometimes.
So, Dragonborn. What do you say?
So, you in for a little fishin'?
Someone bring me a drink, quick!
Sorry, the mine's dry right now.
Sorry, was only joking with you.
Staying out of trouble, kinsman?
Such was my... honor. As Keeper.
Sure I did. And I'd do it again.
Sure, leave. Everyone else does.
Sure, my voice could use a rest.
Take your seat and we can begin.
Tell my family I fought bravely.
Thanks for looking after Hrefna.
That gem looks suspicious to me.
That wasn't so hard, now was it.
The [QUOTE]Eye of Magnus[QUOTE]?
The blood of Markarth is silver.
The bloodiest beef in the Reach.
The boss went down there? Today?
The courier must have found you.
The Emissary? What's this about?
The mine is rich, and so are we.
The rest of you lot are with me.
Their defeat was merely a delay.
Then I guess we're done talking.
Then I think we're done talking.
Then suffer the Emperor's wrath.
Then you'll see some real magic.
There's a cave. Tread carefully.
There's plenty that needs doing.
These Reach folk are so... nosy.
Think you've got the mettle, eh?
This is lovely, as always, Eola.
This... this is... an outrage...
Too bad. That one's my favorite.
Ugh, Draugr. They reek of decay.
Um, no. Nothing. Nothing at all.
Um...this place looks dangerous.
Until then, I've no ale for you.
Veren... Thorek... you're alive!
Very good. Then we're done here.
Viinturuth! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
Vittoria is practically glowing.
Vuljotnaak! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
Vulwulf, it's always a pleasure.
Warrens ain't for you. Trust me.
We aren't the bad guys you know.
We both leave well enough alone.
We'll have our freedom. One day.
We're so grateful for your help.
We've been awaiting your return.
We've got nothing to talk about.
Well, I never claimed otherwise.
Well, I was only trying to help.
Well, that's something at least.
Well, what are you waiting for?!
Were you able to learn anything?
What are you waiting for? Do it!
What is that blowhard up to now?
What? Did... you need something?
What? Do I have mead on my chin?
What? No! Get back in your cage!
What's going on? And who's this?
Why are they hurting each other?
Why? What are you gonna do, cry?
Wow! What was that? Do it again!
Wrong on all accounts, aren't I?
Yeah, that's what papa says too.
Yeah, well I don't see anything.
Yes, I hear that question often.
Yes, well. Perhaps you're right.
You are not worthy of Sovngarde!
You drove them off? By yourself?
You found... how in the world...
You got business at the stables?
You heard what she said, Ulfric.
You leave me no choice, citizen.
You mean the inn, or Winterhold?
You need an escort at all times.
You really shouldn't be in here.
You should never have come here!
You survived! You have it, then?
You think running will save you?
You would shut out the darkness?
You, my friend, need practice...
You'll defeat Ancano, won't you?
You're a tricky one. Now fix it.
You're gonna get me out of here?
You're too slow. I saw it first.
You're trying my patience, lass.
You've brought this on yourself.
Your a hard woman to please Una.
Your doom has come, damned worm!
Your objective is Fort Greymoor.
Your objective is Fort Snowhawk.
Ah, have you? Let Kesh have them.
Ah, so you're an alchemist, then?
Ah! No more! Don't hurt me again.
All right. Keep up the good work.
Along the fence, do you see them?
And the outpost at Dragon Bridge?
And what might you be looking at?
Another victim fell for our ruse!
Any progress on finding the mask?
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.
Back again? What is it this time?
Backup! I need some help in here!
But damn if I ain't almost sober.
But how would you know it's real?
But now it all comes out again...
But you said that was impossible.
By Sithis, what... what happened?
By Sithis, you will pay for that!
By that rock over there. See 'em?
By Ysmir! There's a killer about.
Can't fail now... must hang on...
Clear Skies - combine our Shouts!
Close the door, then we can talk.
Come back when you have the coin.
Come closer. Bask in my presence.
Come on, at least try to hurt me.
Come on, I'll explain on the way.
Come on, show me what you've got!
Come on! This is our best chance!
Come out and face me, you coward!
Come then. See what I can do now.
Come, Legate. There's much to do.
coughing - no subtitles displayed
Damn. Another body to get rid of.
Deliver this axe to Jarl Hrongar.
Dibella's Heart, son, I hope not.
Did Harrald send you to taunt me?
Do I know you? I didn't think so.
Don't get too flowery on me, lad.
Don't just stand there! Kill her!
Don't just stand there! Kill him!
Don't leave me, for Arkay's sake!
Don't let her get away with this!
Don't let him get away with this!
Elenwen must be very fond of you.
Enjoy your visit to Dragonsreach.
Faida's the name. I keep the inn.
Fail, and it won't matter anyway.
Feel like doing a bit of writin'?
Felldir! We agreed not to use it!
Fine. We do it your way. For now.
Fool! He is perverting my Light. 
Fortune smiles upon this meeting.
Fortune to you and your children.
Frabbi, a customer needs a drink!
Gat and I are the only survivors.
Get it away from me. Get it away!
Get your thieving hands off that!
Glad you decided to check us out.
Go. Out. Before I change my mind.
Good. Here's what you need to do.
Good. I'll be waiting right here.
Good. Make it it happen, soldier.
Grunt of effort, done as a zombie
Hakon! A glorious day, is it not!
Have you been learning your ores?
Here. A little something for you.
Here. Take my amulet as a reward.
Hey, here. Have one on the house.
Hey! What are you trying to pull?
Hey! You dropped this back there.
Hey! You're the one that hurt me!
Hiding only prolongs your demise.
Hmph. What a boring conversation.
Ho, now... Keep me out of this...
How are you feeling, Jarl Idgrod?
How could you just leave me here?
How dare you! You disgusting pig!
How in the world did that happen?
How may I serve you, my Listener?
How much do they pay you per day?
I am sworn to carry your burdens.
I can go back to my life for now.
I can't believe we're doing this.
I cast shadows across your grave!
I didn't really want that anyway.
I didn't think you'd get pinched.
I don't like where this is going.
I guess we'd better try this way.
I have no more business with you.
I have records I need to tend to.
I hope monsters come and eat you.
I love you. You know that, right?
I meant no disrespect, of course.
I see no reason to keep fighting.
I should make sure Svari is okay.
I still don't have my Gleda back.
I swear, if I'm being followed...
I trust the night finds you well?
I understand, mother. Forgive me.
I want to hear about this dragon.
I... well, let me think about it.
I'll be back, and you'll be dead!
I'll bury my blade in your heart!
I'll have your head for a trophy!
I'll not go down without a fight!
I'm Anska.  Are you here to help?
I'm just as puzzled as you, lass.
I'm not looking for conversation.
If he's willing, then we'll talk.
If you need a drink, just holler.
In their tongue, he is Dovahkiin.
Is my staff seeing to your needs?
Is that magic? Careful, please...
Is there any news from High Rock?
It is good to meet you in person.
It pleases me to hear you say so.
It shouldn't have been like this.
It... it worked. Mara be praised!
It's coming loose. I can feel it.
It's good to see you again, dear.
It's like being born. Every time.
It's wearing a dangerous spell...
Keep under cover until it's down!
Kill him now, while we still can!
Legends don't burn down villages.
Let me give you a word of advice.
Let me worry about the Imperials.
Let the darkness rip you asunder!
Let's move out. Time's a wasting.
Let's see what Esbern has to say.
May the road favor the foolish...
Maybe you should just move along.
My mother's not any help, either.
My only aim is to keep the peace.
My teeth to your neck, Dovahkiin!
Next time think before you speak.
Next, the renegade from Cyrodiil!
Nice try, but you don't scare me.
No idea what's causing it though.
No, please! I don't understand...
Not bad... but it won't save you.
Not going to weigh in either way?
Not now. The Underforge, tonight.
Now here's a man I'm glad to see.
Nust wo ni qiilaan fen kos duaan.
Oh my, old Ma'zaka has a visitor!
Oh, hello. Have a seat, will you?
Oh, my, I hadn't thought of that.
Oh, no. No, that won't do at all.
Oh, pardon me. Was I in your way?
On this day... I go to Sovngarde.
Ooh, now that one must have hurt!
Or else what? You don't scare me.
Our new home. I'll see you there!
Paarthurnax is weak. I am strong.
Please don't interrupt the court.
Please, just... just leave me be!
Please, we do not have much time.
Please! Release me! Cut my bonds!
Pleasure doin' business with you.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Pretty, pretty flesh. Let me out!
Priest of Arkay. I'm your friend.
Protect the Jarl with your lives!
Put on some damn clothes already!
Quickly, we have no time to lose.
Quiet! I think I heard something.
Ready when you need me, Listener.
Remember, this is between us now.
Rikke. You don't have to do this.
Say on, friend. What do you need?
See if you can get the door open.
See into other people's thoughts!
See that it doesn't happen again.
She's agreed to be your forebear.
She's supposed to be on our side?
Shhh! Be still. Beware her anger!
sniffling- no subtitles displayed
So sick... can hardly stand it...
So, not much has changed, really.
So, you don't need anything then.
Some take to it more than others.
Somebody get that fool a blanket.
Something simple, a stew perhaps.
Song or not, I just want it done.
Spoken like a true son of Skyrim!
Start at the beginning, as usual.
Stay away! Last time you hurt me.
Sure thing. It's yours for a day.
Sure, take all my things. Please.
Sweet breath of Arkay, thank you.
Take the money, just let us go...
Thank you again for all the help.
Thank you for the gold, traveler.
Thank you. Here, this is for you.
That spell looks like it'll hurt.
That's it? That's all you've got?
The elements are mine to command!
The mist is gone! A glorious day!
The one who calls himself Ancano.
The shadows will be your undoing!
The Thalmor Embassy welcomes you.
The very thought breaks my heart.
There's always the Thieves Guild.
They are perfect. Thank you both.
They challenge us to be our best.
They picked on the wrong old man.
Things proceeding well, Listener?
This doesn't concern you, friend.
This is all your fault, you know.
This is why I avoid being social.
Thurri du hin sille ko Sovngarde!
Time to end your foolish charade!
Time's up! Better luck next time.
Troll's blood was he a tough one!
Ugh, you reek. Get out of my way.
Ugh. You mangy piece of pit-bait.
Use Dragonrend, to drag him down!
Wait just a blessed moment, Bryn.
Wait. Are you... Are you serious?
Was in over her head, I'm afraid.
We all wait upon you, Dragonborn.
We bring honor to the Companions.
We did well today, Shield-Sister.
We killed it! I can't believe it!
We must be prepared to face them.
We need to get back to Jorrvaskr.
We need to get inside. Follow me!
We shall safeguard it... for now.
We should have the festival soon.
We should present the verse soon.
We thought it would be so simple.
We will sate the hunger together.
We're here to teach you a lesson.
We've got to ground that bastard!
Welcome to Khajiit's humble camp.
Well, a few reasons come to mind.
Well, I'm not quite done myself. 
Well, well. Hello there, big man.
Well, when you put it that way...
Well. I wish it were that simple.
Well... yes. There is something. 
Weren't expecting that, were you!
What did you say to me, Reachman?
What did you tell them last time?
What do you know about soul gems?
What do you say? Can you do this?
What guidance could you offer me?
What is life's greatest illusion?
What was that? Don't do it again.
What, you still think it's funny?
What? Now's not the time to chat.
What? Why, are you... interested?
When will Sanuarach Mine be open?
Whichever it is, I don't like it.
Who in the name of Azura are you?
Who's there? Is that you, father?
Why can't he just leave us alone?
Why doesn't someone do something?
Why would you even listen to him?
Wish I could say the same for us.
Yes, and I couldn't tell you why.
Yes, lad? Did you need something?
Yes, what about the Lady Elisif? 
Yes, yes, thank you and all that.
You already know all that I know.
You aren't angry about it, right?
You can buy me whatever you want!
You can offer, but I may not buy.
You did it. There's the entrance!
You didn't need to leave so soon.
You have someone already, friend.
You have your orders. Get moving.
You heard right! I said a dragon!
You heard what she said, Tullius.
You should not be here, outsider.
You should probably speak to her.
You sure? Fine. I'll stand watch.
You will hear me out, then? Good.
You won't take my eye, man-thing!
You... you can't do this to me...
You're not afraid of me, are you?
You're not getting that treasure.
You're not going to shoot, right?
You're not supposed to be here...
You're nothing, hear me? Nothing!
You're starting to make me angry.
You're the Dragonborn aren't you?
You've brought us quite the meal.
Your objective is Fort Greenwall.
Your Thu'um is no match for mine.
Ysgramor would be ashamed of you!
A battle-mage of fearsome cunning.
A healing spell? Are you a priest?
A war veteran should be respected.
A welcome to you, fellow traveler.
Absolutely. Here you are. Be well.
Again, together! Alduin is strong!
Ah! Keep your spells away from me.
Ah. Indeed, indeed. I do remember.
All right, I'll take a look at it.
All this just to kill me Clavicus?
Alright, you are now under arrest.
And I'm telling you, you're wrong.
And now you have it. No harm done.
And they always come to regret it.
Anything I can do for you, I will.
Are you all right? You seem tired.
Are you bothering me for a reason?
Are you ready to give me the Star?
At this rate that'll never happen.
Back to the great task of waiting.
Bah. What's so good about it, hmm?
Bandits... the worst type of scum.
Beem! What are you doing? Stop it!
Best leave the past buried, I say.
But seriously. What's the message?
But that's your problem, not mine.
But we never found one. Until now.
But why? Why must you stop Alduin?
By the gods, the blood! The blood!
C'mon, let's get something to eat.
Can I help you with anything else?
Come back if you want to play tag.
Come on, you need your hands free.
Come on. What are you waiting for?
Come to laugh at the grave tender?
Come, come. I haven't got all day.
Could you move? You're in the way.
Cover yourself. Have you no shame?
Damn it. I gave it away, didn't I?
Defend the Sepulcher at all costs!
Did my worthless husband send you?
Did you make something bad happen?
Do I get to keep it? Just kidding.
Don't do that again. Last warning.
Don't get too flowery on me, lass.
Don't say something you'll regret.
Dovahkiin, hin kah fen kos bonaar.
Eh? Who's there? Rodulf, that you?
Either way, this is the end of it.
Everyone! Everyone! Gather 'round!
Everything is splendid, thank you.
Excuse me, but I'm trying to read.
Fancy a game of Iron Hearts later?
Five, four, three, two, one... go!
Fjola?  How do you know that name?
For a stranger, you're not so bad.
Gah! Let's get on with it already!
Go, and avenge my Laelette for me.
Go. Your very presence sickens me.
Gods help us, this can't end well.
Good luck. You're on your own now.
Good to talk to a fellow traveler.
Good work! Let's see what you got.
Grab anything useful and let's go.
Have you seen one in your travels?
Haven't fought like that in years.
Haven't you got some chores to do?
He knows that. They all know that.
He must have been very convincing.
Helgen? Has something happened...?
Help us and you may earn a pardon.
Here it is. Magnificent, isn't it?
Here you are. So sorry about that.
Here you go, sir. Colovian brandy.
Here you go. This should cover it.
Here. Take this for your trouble. 
Here's your share of their reward.
Hey, I want to talk to you... now.
Hey! I didn't ask you to magic me.
Hey! Somebody get down here! Help!
Hhhmmm...maybe I put it over here.
Hiding? The shadows are my domain!
Hmm. I was sure I heard something.
Hold it there! Keep your distance.
I am not going to let that happen!
I can do that! I did it yesterday!
I can only hammer so fast, Gerdur.
I can't bear it... make it stop...
I can't believe it's come to this.
I can't wait to see what's inside!
I consider this conversation over.
I don't know if we can outrun 'em.
I don't know. What'd he look like?
I fear that will be the way of it.
I grow restless. As does my blade.
I guess I was just hearing things.
I have my own expenses you know...
I have no desire to seek religion.
I honor my lord by destroying you!
I hope Alva is not what you think.
I hope this isn't something I did.
I hope you know what you're doing.
I just need a little to get going.
I know you're here. Show yourself.
I promise a swift but painful end!
I serve Jarl Baalgruuf as steward.
I shall sing of thee in Sovngarde!
I think so. Just hold on a moment.
I think we're almost out. Come on!
I thought I was going to help you!
I trust you have good news for me.
I wouldn't hold out too much hope.
I... I don't care! I'm not paying!
I... I'll get his things in order.
I'll be here if you need me, love.
I'll buy everything you've dug up.
I'll look the other way this time.
I'll shoulder some of your burden.
I'll take a bottle of spiced wine.
I'll try to forget you ever asked.
I'm cutting your pay for this job.
I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's move on.
I'm going to crush you like a bug!
I'm not seeing things again, am I?
I'm not so sure we should be here.
I'm so confused. What's happening?
I'm sorry, I should really go now.
I'm sorry! This isn't what I want!
I'm... I'm not sure what happened.
I've been waiting for you. Hjalti.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
I've got a feeling about this one.
I've never held a knitting needle.
I've seen better. Well, maybe not.
Imperial business. Be on your way.
Ingun? She's brilliant; a natural!
Is that so? I was right about you.
Is that? Did you repair the blade?
Is there something you need, dear?
It has been an honor, Jarl Ulfric!
It is my job to know these things.
It is planning on starting a fire?
It seems we may have an agreement.
It's a bit worn, but I'll take it.
It's a werewolf! To arms! To arms!
It's an honor, Keeper of the Ring.
It's our honor to have you there. 
Just wait. Just... I can fix this.
Keep your damn spells to yourself.
Kind of scary if I think about it.
Kodlak did not care for vengeance.
Look around. Grab anything useful.
Look out, I think we have company.
Look out! The prisoners are loose!
Look, I've got training to get to.
Many I fear still need convincing.
Maven, I... please, don't hurt me.
Maybe later. I'm sort of busy now.
Maybe one of the guards had a key?
Maybe. I'll see if I feel like it.
Mirabelle will be waiting for you.
Move it. Get to work. Get to work!
My duty is to guard Brina Merilis.
My sword will taste of your blood!
Nasty little buggers, aren't they?
No, Karita. I don't think I could.
No, no. I'll... I'll wait outside.
Not here. The Underforge. Come on.
Not now, I'm trying to watch this!
Not sure you belong here, citizen.
Nothing for it but to keep moving.
Now go and make us some coin, lad!
Now I'm going to have to kill you!
Now it's your turn, Thalmor bitch.
Now our business together is done.
Now that you mention it, there is.
Now, now! That won't be necessary.
Now, on to the business at hand...
Now. We really must be going, sir.
Oh Babette, but you are so wicked.
Oh dear, I hadn't thought of that.
Oh, no it hasn't. Let's be honest.
Oh, not so confident now, are we? 
Oh? Something interesting, I hope?
Okay lad, ready to make some coin?
Petra, you traitorous grouse! Die!
Please hold still, and don't move.
Please, come and browse our goods.
Please, please let me out of here!
Please! Have mercy... I beg you...
Really? Now that is interesting...
Really? That would be kind of you.
Retrieve that shield at all costs.
See you on the other side, mortal.
She hardly mentions anything else.
Shor's blood, what have they done?
Shor's bones, I hope you're right.
short yawn- no subtitles displayed
So, um, mind if I buy you a drink?
Sorry, fresh out. Maybe next time.
Sorry, Listener. It can't be done.
Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.
Spare a coin for a poor old woman?
Stand in the center of the circle.
Strangers are nothing but trouble.
Strong gauntlets for strong hands.
Take a moment to breathe, soldier.
Take care of yourself, beef roast.
Take your ease, let troubles fade.
Tell these Horkers to set me free.
Th...thank you, my Jarl thank you.
Thank you. I will not forget this.
Thanks for bringing the claw back.
That could have turned out better.
That doesn't begin to describe it.
That the best the Legion has? Heh.
That's what I keep telling myself.
The blessing of Arkay be upon you.
The Daedra has us. It's you or me!
The dead exist to feed the living.
The fields will need cutting soon.
The prisoners just walk right out.
The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!
The Thu'um! He summons the Thu'um!
Then allow me to introduce myself.
These are troubling times, indeed.
This imperial armor is damn heavy.
This way... the library isn't far.
This will only take me a moment...
Those fools are actually fighting!
To Oblivion and back, as they say.
To the time after Oblivion opened.
Today you die, your doom has come.
Twilight watch over you, guardian.
Typical. Well don't mind me, then.
Umm... what were we talking about?
Unlike your Imperial friends here.
Very well, please use it for food.
Very well, Roggvir. Bow your head.
Very well. Keep at it. You may go.
Wasn't our last catch a Cave Bear?
We did well today, Shield-Brother.
We need to find a way out of here.
We will be back. This is not over.
We've got to find Thorald quickly!
We've got to get this bridge down.
Well, did you bring back any mead?
Well, that's a different matter...
Well, then. Fine. Have a nice day.
Well? What is the meaning of this?
What's become of the Skeleton Key?
When was your first meal, Banning?
Where's your precious Emperor now?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch the magic!
Whoa, whoa, whoa? What did you do?
Whoa... Not even I'm that drunk...
Why are you bothering me, kinsman?
Why do you think? End of the line.
Why you insolent little bastard...
Why, why have you done this to us?
Why? I want to watch the soldiers.
Wield powerful magic incantations!
Will you take it to Captain Aldis?
With the lighting of the effigy...
Wizards. Why is it always wizards.
Yes, lass? Did you need something?
Yes, sir. I'll try to contain her.
Yes, that will be fine. Thank you.
Yes, yes, as with you. Now be off.
Yes, yes. I haven't got all day...
Yes! Yes! Return me to this realm!
Yield, and I may still show mercy!
You better know what you're doing!
You better know what you're doing.
You can take it over my dead body!
You can't kill what you can't see!
You cannot take this away from me!
You could trap him there, exactly.
You have our gratitude, Arch-Mage.
You looking for something or what?
You must help us appease Malacath.
You need to go inside, little cub.
You only face failure once more...
You planning on using that weapon?
You seem uncomfortable being here.
You think Alva...but that means...
You'll be well paid for your time.
You're busy. I'll come back later.
You're going? I'll miss you, dear.
You're not supposed to be in here.
You've done it! You've beaten him!
Your depths will open to the mind!
Your payment, for a job well done.
A boy's gotta make a livin', right?
A pity. And words I hear too often.
A shame. Perhaps another time then.
A truly remarkable place, isn't it?
A very powerful family in Windhelm.
Ah good, I could use some practice!
Ah yes, you were with us at Helgen.
Ah, of course. I suspected as much.
Ah. Well, some other time, perhaps.
Alduin cannot ignore this for long.
Alduin saraan hin sil ko Sovngarde!
All right, I'll go kill this giant.
All the living shall fear the dead!
Always sad when someone has to die.
And I would deserve it, wouldn't I?
And I'm sure you could do it, too. 
And what's that have to do with me?
Anyway, it's done. Time to move on.
Are you sure this is the right way?
Are you sure you aren't a stranger?
As do I. It's a puzzling situation.
At this very moment? No. However...
Aw, that's so sweet of you! Thanks!
Aye, lass. Nothing's getting by me.
Back from whence you came, heathen!
Be patient and your time will come.
Been stuck with the name for years.
Better to stick together down here.
Browse as much as you like, please.
But I digress. Here's your payment.
But I insist. and with good reason.
But no, it is not in my possession.
But someone keeps taking them down.
By what right do you request entry?
By Ysmir, this will not end well...
Can't you see I'm working? Beat it.
Come back when you grow a backbone.
Come on, I haven't got all morning.
Come on, you can make it. Let's go.
Come. Come and face the Forsworn...
Cross the bridge at your own peril!
Did you bring anything? The pain...
Die! For the love of the gods, die!
DO NOT RECORD - blank blocking info
Don't bother with Tacitus. Useless.
Don't touch that dagger! It's mine.
Either way, it's off limits to you.
Even Khajiit have their limits. No.
Even the Dragonborn betrays Skyrim.
Faas nu, zini dein ruthi ahst vaal.
Fastred, I wanted to talk with you.
Fine, I'll show you, you big bully.
First you... then all of the Reach!
Food's hot. Never said it was good.
Get away from me, you filthy woman.
Get away from me, you Skyrim trash.
Give me just one... little... bite!
Glad the antidote is taking effect.
Go ahead and play your little joke.
Go where the challenge is greatest.
Good for him. For the both of them.
Good riddance to bad rubbish I say.
Good, I can use the exercise. Haha!
Good. Do not spare them your blade.
Good. One less worry for my people.
Got nothing to say to strange folk.
Hang on Mercer! I'm coming to help!
Hello. Welcome to the Pawned Prawn.
Here you go, boss. All the details.
Here you go, miss. Colovian brandy.
Hey, someone had to take it, right?
Hey! Over here! Get me out of here!
Hmm. Feel a bit better now. Thanks.
Hmm... All right... How about this?
Hold on. This can get a bit tricky.
Honored to see you again, my Thane.
How are your chores coming, my son?
How are your students coming along?
Hrmmm. Pick up your trash, fetcher.
Huh. Dwarven ruins. Strange places.
Hush, Vulwulf... let the boy speak.
I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers.
I am wise woman to this stronghold.
I can always count on you, can't I?
I can't wait to see Sabjorn squirm.
I could listen to her play all day.
I could listen to him play all day.
I could never hope to approach her.
I didn't mean... I'm sorry I asked.
I don't have any choice! I'm sorry!
I don't have to take that from you!
I don't think so. That axe is mine.
I don't want to see you ever again.
I had a bad dream again last night.
I have never doubted that, husband.
I have spoken. The Rotmulaag waits.
I have things to study, what is it?
I hope Brynjolf chokes on his gold.
I make sure Erikur keeps breathing.
I need you to do me a favor, Dirge.
I never should have taken this job!
I tend to keep my patrons' privacy.
I try to hold us to the right path.
I will conquer where Alduin failed.
I will entreat Mara on your behalf.
I will train better for the future.
I wish you well friend. Be careful.
I work for Eydis. She runs the inn.
I'll be right here. Be careful now!
I'll bring a blanket and some wine.
I'll head back home if you need me.
I'll shatter your bones like glass!
I'm afraid I didn't see anything...
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this.
I'm going to find whoever did this.
I'm gonna wear that tail as a belt!
I'm not looking for a conversation.
I'm running low on Grand Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Petty Soul Gems.
I'm so glad you could attend today.
I'm sure he will prove most useful.
I'm sure I know what this is about.
I've fought colds tougher than you!
If nobody wants that, I'll take it.
If you can pass the test, then yes.
If you're smart, you'll walk away. 
In any case, I have a task for you.
Inkpot. Stone. Bucket. Book. Knife.
Inside the mind of Pelagius, silly.
Is there a reason you're asking me?
Is there some way I can assist you?
It is a fine day to work the mines.
It won't die, it just keeps coming!
It's all up to you now... Listener.
It's not a cause. It's a rebellion.
Just let me know when you're ready.
Just looking at you makes me upset.
Just shut up and keep out of sight.
Just tell me who needs bludgeoning.
Just... leave here! Leave us alone!
Keep away from that bow. It's mine.
Killing him was a bit... impulsive.
Lad, I know what you've been up to.
Looks like the boss is at it again.
Looks like you got someone already.
May Talos shield you from all harm.
May the Divines guide and keep you.
May the shadows guide your journey.
May the sun warm your path, friend.
May wisdom forever light your path.
Most of my friends are buried here.
My honor isn't so cheap, outlander.
My previous champion displeases me.
Narfi so happy! So happy! So happy!
No more than I was already getting.
No Sam, no protection. Time to die.
No, I want to take my time with it.
Nocturnal will feed upon your soul!
Not anymore. Thanks to you. Friend.
Not everyone's agreed to the Moot. 
Not here. Out in the yard. Come on.
Not lately. Business has been slow.
Not so sure of yourself after all? 
Not sure, let's watch and find out.
Now go and make us some coin, lass!
Now here's a woman I'm glad to see.
Now I've got to clean up this mess.
Now you. You can call me Ann Marie.
Now... now you'll let me go. Right?
Now... what did you say you wanted?
Oh, for the love of Mara. What now?
Oh, no no no... This is so wrong...
Okay lass, ready to make some coin?
Only one more door left.  Hurry up.
Our father, Jergen, raised us here.
Our secret ingredient, if you will.
Perhaps I'll be seeing more of you.
Pick up your mess. Then we'll talk.
Pickpocket! We've got a pickpocket!
Please, help yourself to more wine.
Please, I can't... Just... just go.
Please, stranger! I need your help!
Please, take pity on an old madman!
Please, tell me you have good news.
Probably not, but it's worth a try!
Ralof... get away from there, fool!
Rather convincing, don't you think?
Shor's bones, I might just have to!
Sigh. Yes, as usual. I'll be there.
Skjor was looking for you, earlier.
So much wasted breath in that crew.
So there's nothing more to be said.
So, Thrynn, you were a bandit, huh?
So, what is it? What have you done?
So, why'd you join the Stormcloaks?
So. You're one of Ulfric's spies...
Sondas, I've heard about Morrowind.
Sorry, love, but I'm not a charity.
Spare a coin for a poor old beggar?
Stand back and behold my handiwork.
Steal anything worth talking about?
Stop it! This is a one-on-one duel!
Straight to business with you, huh?
Taking me up on my offer, eh? Good.
Taking this man to be interrogated.
Tell me when you are ready, mortal.
Thank the Divines we survived that.
Thank you Klimmek. That's too kind.
Thank you, miss, I appreciate that.
Thank you. I knew you'd understand.
That I am. You know how to use one?
That son-of-a-bitch! I'll kill him!
That's done it! Let's get in there.
That's it! We're pushing them back!
That's right. Who's invisible? Me! 
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
The Forsworn. Here inside the city.
The gods will be the judge of that.
The Gourmet. This is such an honor.
The Greybeards are a strange bunch.
The men will be fighting in flames.
The mine is just how I remember it.
The mist is gone, my mind is clear.
The old man... Kodlak... he's dead.
The Stormcloaks will never stop us.
The Thu'um! She summons the Thu'um!
Then you are worth more to me dead!
Then you know what a beauty she is.
Then you're stupider than you look.
There is much beauty in this place.
There you go, son. Be your own man!
There's no time to waste. Let's go.
There's the Blades agent! Kill her!
There's the Blades agent! Kill him!
These two aren't a problem anymore.
They got archers up along the wall!
They will sing stories of this day.
Thinking I need to train some more.
This is just what I need right now.
This is last time we speak of this.
This place is sure to make us rich!
Thoring runs the inn. Speak to him.
Troll's blood! It's a torture room.
Twenty coins? No one has that much.
Ulfric Stormcloak's head on a pike.
Walk always in shadow, my Listener.
Was something we discussed unclear?
Watch out for pressure plates here.
Watch your hands around the Legate.
We are strong. We get the job done.
We won't give you any more trouble.
We're in this together. Stay close.
We're not going to make it, are we?
We've received a desperate missive.
Well now... would you look at that.
Well one of us has to do something!
Well, I suppose he wouldn't mind...
Well, what do you say, my brothers?
Well! Finders, keepers as they say.
What about being loyal to his wife?
What are your thoughts on all this?
What did you do in Wolfskull cave?!
What weapon do you like, Harbinger?
What? No. No don't kill me. Please!
What? Who... what do you want then?
What? Why would he do such a thing?
When you got that much, we'll talk.
Where am I? You! Out with it, then.
Which, the mutton or the vegetable?
Whiterun is only a means to an end.
Why are you bothering me, outsider?
Why are you here? Get away from me!
Why didn't you say so immediately?!
Why don't you go... sell something.
Why don't you just kill me already.
Why, you don't think I could do it?
Yeaaaah! Come on, we can take them!
Yeah... That's not going to happen.
Yes, but it needs to be kept quiet.
Yes, can I help you with something?
Yes, Dovahkiin? How can I help you?
Yes, Listener? How may I serve you?
Yes, yes. Let's see what we have...
Yes? Make it quick, I'm a busy man.
You again. What are you doing here?
You are no match for me, Dovahkiin.
You aren't worth my time. Piss off.
You fool. You don't stand a chance.
You fought well. I find you worthy.
You going to be at the inn tonight?
You have a death wish or something?
You have no authority over me, boy.
You have someone with you, already.
You have stepped on us long enough!
You look like you could use an ale.
You want in, you need to cooperate.
You want me to do something or not?
You wanted me to do something, yes?
You won't even live to regret this!
You'll have to do better than that.
You'll need to do better than that.
You're a disgrace to your own kind!
You're a real fighter. I like that.
You're a talkative one, aren't you.
You're right. Sorry to bring it up.
You've done it! That's all of them!
Your payment for services rendered.
Your payment, my friend. Well done.
...I'm sorry, friends. I'm so sorry!
A little girl is dead because of me.
A...a body! How absolutely terrible.
Agh! I been wounded worse by better!
Ah, good. I've been waiting on that.
Ah, so it's gold you're after, then?
Ah. I believe I can be of help here.
And so slain the beast inside of me.
And you're worried about your shoes?
Another filthy cave. Always so dark.
Anything, as long as I get to fight.
Are you prepared for tonight's hunt?
Argonian Ale! I can almost taste it!
Balgruuf, my Jarl. A word, if I may.
Because I have no wish to be harmed.
Biggest damn spiders I've ever seen.
But before I fought, I had to train.
But I'll see for myself soon enough.
But now Skyrim is at Ulfric's mercy.
But they don't say how he does this.
But, I need that money! I earned it.
By Sithis, now I am truly impressed!
Can I help you with anything, Nirya?
Can't wait to count out your coin...
Can't wait to kill another Imperial.
Come on now, fight your own battles.
Deliver your report to Legate Rikke.
Derkeethus, from Darkwater Crossing.
Did you do everything I said, Shadr?
Did you hear all that noise outside?
Did you raise your prices, Carlotta?
Did you still need me for something?
Do you have business with the court?
Do you know what he's talking about?
Don't cause any trouble in the city.
Draugr. Dammit. I hate those things.
Easy, easy. Don't get up so quickly.
Eight septims per day, plus lodging.
Eyes open and walk with the shadows.
Eyes open. Danger could be anywhere.
Faith? I don't have faith in anyone.
Finally. I got stuff to do, ya know.
Finally. Now I can get back to work.
Fine. I'm not dying without a fight!
Flattery doesn't suit you, Thongvor.
Forgive me, I didn't mean to assume.
Fresh fruit and vegetables for sale!
Gerdur, I'm fine. At least now I am.
Glory only awaits those who triumph.
Go. Grieve in whatever way you know.
Good, we've wasted enough time here.
Good. Glad we straightened that out.
Good. I can use someone I can trust.
Got a feeling there's trouble ahead.
Grelod the Kind. Is she... you know?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's my boy!
Ha! Too true, my friend. Too true...
Have a fascination with fire, do we?
Have you taken leave of your senses?
He gives other merchants a bad name.
He what? What are you talking about?
He'll answer any questions you have.
He's a true Nord. He'll come around.
Head on, then. I'll keep an eye out.
Hello friend. Make yourself at home.
Here. Take this. I hope you like it.
Hiding only prolongs the inevitable.
How about... we play tag! You're it!
How are the young ones coming along?
How could you possibly know about...
How goes the begging today, Brenuin?
How much worse is this going to get?
Huh... what was that? What'd you do?
I answer the call of the Dragonborn.
I bleed for the people of the Reach!
I can cut you loose inside. Come on!
I don't have time for this nonsense.
I don't like the look of this place.
I don't think that was a compliment.
I don't want you to leave Ivarstead.
I hope we didn't offend him somehow.
I like you Una. You've got presence.
I owe you a great deal, Nightingale.
I suppose you have another question?
I thought we were all dead for sure!
I trust this is something important?
I trust you'll put your weapon away?
I want a drink, not company. Now go.
I will take back my family's castle.
I'd just as soon get this over with.
I'll do what I can here. Go now, go!
I'll just prepare the subject now...
I'll make sure it's sent right away.
I'll paint the snow with your blood!
I'm in charge of the prisoners here.
I'm in mourning. Can't you see that?
I'm not sure what this is all about.
I'm ready for this party to be over.
I'm running low on Common Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Lesser Soul Gems.
I'm so angry, I can hardly stand it!
I'm sure she will prove most useful.
I'm sure you have something in mind.
If it will help you, then certainly.
If only we'd stayed out of Saarthal.
If you need anything else, just ask.
Is it getting hot, or is it just me?
Is it much further to the sanctuary?
Is there anything you need, dearest?
Is there... something else you need?
It was good speaking with you again.
It's all for a good cause, old chap.
It's Honorhall Orphanage, in Riften.
It's Karliah... her name is Karliah.
It's to be a real fight, then. Good!
It's tough, with just the two of us.
Items? What items? Let me see those.
Its scent is foul, unclean. Hurtful.
J'zargo is ready for more adventure.
Jawanan, I don't see you here often.
Just give me a minute. Let me think.
Just head north - you can't miss it.
Just sit back. This won't take long.
Just... try and keep out of our way.
Khajiit has wares, if you have coin.
Kynareth humbles us with her beauty.
Lady Mara... I await your embrace...
Lass, I know what you've been up to.
Let's go our separate ways now, hmm?
Let's just hope that doesn't happen.
Let's talk about it some other time.
Let's teach these bastards a lesson.
Look, I'll make this simple for you.
Lost funt. You are too late, Alduin!
Mama, why are you and papa fighting?
May the shroud of death embrace you.
Maybe I'll see you around the Guild.
My lord. Please. You have to listen.
My old bones don't hurt so much now.
My sister in crime. What'd you need?
Nivahriin muz fent siiv nid aaz het.
No funny business. I'm watching you.
No harm is meant to you, happy fool.
No killin' or no pay. Remember that.
No time, I have business to conduct.
No, and at this rate, I never shall!
No, no. You just stay here and rest.
No? I daresay we don't have all day.
Nobody pilfers property on my watch.
Not bad. Next time won't be so easy.
Not now, it's time for the ceremony.
Nothing, until you choose to use it.
Now then. I assume you know about...
Now why would I want to talk to you?
Now, let's see what there is to see.
Oh, a bit of this and a bit of that.
Oh, this is not going to end well...
Oh. I'm sorry I said anything, then.
Ohh... but I will have your blood...
Ooohhhh, ahhhrrrghhhh... uuuuggghhh.
Please stop looking at me like that.
Please, we need to speak in private.
Return my beacon to Mount Kilkreath.
Seems like a ruin. Dwarven, I think?
Shadows preserve us. So it's true...
Sir! I... I have... <breathing hard>
Sithis' whisper be upon you, sister.
So many contracts, so little time...
So now we're rich and now I'm chief.
So we grab it and we get out, right?
So we're not turning back, you fool.
Something to tell the grandkids, eh?
Something troublin' ya? I'll listen.
Sounds good. May I owe you for them?
Spare a bite for a poor old veteran?
Spiced Wine for the Winking Skeever?
Steward Falk, I have a task for you.
Still something you'd like me to do?
Submit and pay bloodprice, criminal.
Suddenly I don't feel like fighting.
Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
Sure, Ton. You know I'm good for it.
Sweetheart, did you move my pickaxe?
Take him down! It's our best chance!
Thank you. I'd almost given up hope.
That should do. Now - Inhale deeply.
That's enough, Thongvor. We're done.
That's great. I owe you one. Thanks!
That's right. Turn around and leave.
The Empire will return. Count on it.
The finest fish, here! Caught daily!
The scent of victory is on the wind.
The Stormcloaks pay blood for blood!
There's no excuse for your behavior!
This is not about your desires, lad.
This new armor fits me like a glove.
This one doesn't look too difficult.
This place reeks of gray-skin filth!
Trust like that is not freely given.
Tss! Get out of here, I saw nothing.
Ulfric is the one who has offended. 
Ulfric Stormcloak. Jarl of Windhelm.
Until Ulfric came and put them down.
Very little. It's an uncertain time.
Wait until the boys hear about this.
Wait... the Listener is serious? Oh.
Walk always in the shadow of Sithis.
War of mine? It's not my war, Seren!
We are all in your debt, Dragonborn.
We must clear this confounding mist.
We should not be talking about that.
We'll see about that. Won't we boys?
We're close now. I can see the camp.
We've got a murderer on the loose...
We've got to find a way out of here.
We've got to find someplace to hide!
Welcome back! Good to see you again.
Well it stops now, and that's final!
Well, now. This I hadn't considered.
Well, we have to cut down something!
What brings you out to Shor's Stone?
What news? Why isn't Fjola with you?
When you're standing downwind of me.
Who... who are you? What's going on?
Why are you here? Did you follow me?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Why? We had a deal Madanach. A deal!
Yeah, sure it is. You don't fool me.
Yes, I'm positive I heard something.
Yes. I'm sure he's doing well there.
You are? Very good.... may I see it?
You could say that. I own the place.
You have done admirably, little one.
You ready to pay the toll? One shiv.
You should be talking to my Steward.
You tell J'zargo when you are ready.
You there. I have questions for you.
You used to love finding new places.
You were born into the pack, sister.
You were no match for a Nightingale.
You wish to do what I do? Very well.
You're interrupting the performance.
You're not getting anything from me!
You're one of Namira's faithful now.
*Gasp* Finally, someone came!... I...
A bit much, going around like that...
A bottle of spiced wine for ya, Ataf?
A most pleasant chat. Until the next!
A rubbing, eh? Odd. I expected notes.
Adrianne. At her forge, just outside.
Agreed, we can't afford to try again.
Ah, but there is a slight... problem.
Ah, of course! How much have you got?
All I need is one to cut you in half.
All right, can you describe it to me?
Alva? Didn't think she had it in her.
Always good talking to you... friend.
Always good to talk to a fellow bard.
Always have your shield at the ready.
And just why would you be doing that?
And this must be the Hall of Stories.
And who's this? One of your comrades?
Any luck gathering those ingredients?
Arise, Olaf! My vengeance is at hand!
Arkay helps us find peace with death.
Aww. I thought you were done with it.
Back to another fine day in Dawnstar.
Bad people who don't like werewolves.
Because you are such a very nice Orc?
Before the Blades wiped them all out.
Best batch of Spiced Wine I ever had.
Beware, beware, the Dragonborn comes.
Big grunt of effort, done as a zombie
Boy, did you miss all the excitement.
But... Eisa? She's smarter than that.
Buying and selling fine jewelry here!
By the gods! I assume you have proof.
By the gods! What are you doing here?
By Ysmir, you won't leave here alive!
Can't. Got at least two rounds to go.
Come back to Bits and Pieces anytime.
Come back to me if you find anything.
Come down here and fight, you coward!
Come on! Do it again! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Come on. Hurry. We might be too late.
Come on... there! I got it, let's go!
Come over here. Please pretty please?
Damn addicts always stealing from me.
Damn. I knew I shouldn't have waited.
Defend the Ebonmere! Kill the mortal!
Did you require something of J'zargo?
Die already so I can take your stuff!
Do I trust him? Not in the slightest.
Do not worry, my friend. All is well.
Do you need anything? Are you hungry?
Do you still need me to do something?
Do you wish to aid in this cleansing?
Don't be daft. Proventus is my eyes. 
Don't blame me if your feet get sore.
Don't go to Kolskeggr. It's not safe.
Don't hurry back, I won't be waiting.
Don't let those Stormcloaks get away!
Er, rather, have a nice day, citizen.
Except the ones attacked by Forsworn.
Excuse me. What's your business here?
Finally, reinforcements have arrived.
Fine. Have it you way. A fight it is.
Fool! What do you think you're doing?
Fresh Fish! Straight from the Fjords!
Friend Brunwulf, how good to see you!
Get it back, for the honor of us all.
Gods above, what are you waiting for?
Good honest work staves off the cold.
Good luck. Welcome to the Companions.
Good to see you, lad! How are things?
Good. He must be kept safe from harm.
Good. Take this gift. We're even now.
Grelka, do you fancy a walk tomorrow?
Grrr. Fine, let's get this over with.
Hafjorg! Where did you put it woman?!
Hah! I wish that I had your optimism.
Halt in the name of the Jarl Hrongar.
Has the whole city lost their brains?
Have anything interesting to tell me?
Have I told you about Valen, my dear?
Have you thought about my invitation?
Help! Get that beast out of my house!
Here we are. Whiterun. Everybody out.
Hey! Don't get mad and hurt me again.
Hm. I had not thought of it that way.
How dare you defile this temple, orc!
Huh? What's that now? Leave me alone.
Hungry, tired, or just plain thirsty?
I bet you are. Which one do you want?
I can smell the blood. Good and sour.
I can't remember when I last slept...
I did. Your time, it seems, has come.
I don't do charity. No gold, no ride.
I don't think I need to tell you why.
I don't think you're quite ready yet.
I doubt he'll be free, but all right.
I dunno, sounds like I should try it.
I fight and I'll win. Simple as that.
I guess I expected too much from you.
I guess I should join you more often.
I guess you're smarter than you look.
I have to see her. Please, excuse me.
I hope not. This is an important job.
I hope we bump into each other again.
I hope you're enjoying yourself, sir.
I knew he wouldn't be able to resist.
I knew I could count on you, soldier.
I love it when a plan comes together.
I need only look for a few moments...
I should never have come to Markarth.
I should slay you for such insolence!
I suppose it would be. Good thinking.
I suppose it's not a total loss then.
I thank you for your help, my friend.
I think I hear my daughter calling...
I think someone has a crush on Illdi.
I thought I gave you something to do?
I want you sellswords out of my mine.
I wish you luck in finding the verse.
I... I don't understand. Where is it?
I'll be the one asking the questions.
I'll find some way to finish my book.
I'll get it right this time, I swear.
I'll give it a try, thanks very much.
I'll serve you after you've paid Vex.
I'll show you what a real Orc can do!
I'll start round one. Down the hatch!
I'm going to make you sorry for this!
I'm hoping to run my own inn someday.
I'm not certain what use it would be.
I'm not ready to die. I'm just not...
I'm not sure you belong here, friend.
I'm running low on Greater Soul Gems.
I'm... I'm sorry you had to see that.
I've lost the way and wander blindly.
I've waited an eternity for this day.
If he's not with us, he's against us.
If it's about the mine, I'm all ears.
If you find that ring, bring it here.
If you really think you can manage...
Imperial spies? You can't be serious!
Impossible actually. Hmm, I wonder...
Is that the best the Listener can do?
Is that... the best... you can do... 
Is the food and drink to your liking?
It comforts me to know that, Bolgeir.
It's a foregone conclusion, you know.
It's not luck, it's mead I'm cursing.
It's the rebels! Defend the entrance!
Karliah? Then she's finally found it.
Keep an eye out for Stormcloak spies.
Keerava, Bersi Honey-Hand and Haelga.
Let me know if you want to try again.
Let me out. They're going to kill me!
Let me take a look at what you found.
Let's find that Totem, Shield-Sister.
May Arkay bless you with a long life.
May the crags fail to trip your feet.
May the words of poets keep you warm.
May your road lead you to warm sands.
Meantime, you best steer clear of me.
Miss Faida, may I ask you a question?
Morthal has enough problems as it is!
Must be here somewhere. Keep looking.
Must be my mind playing tricks on me.
My blood's calm. I prefer it boiling.
My men are ready. Now it's up to you.
My time is limited, so speak quickly.
Namira grind your bones for my bread!
Need a room? Or maybe just some mead?
Need anything else, just let me know.
Need anything, you just say the word.
No breaks for a good worker out here.
None of you will be alive to tell it.
Not at all. I consider it a blessing.
Nothing we can do for these ones now.
Now it's my turn, you son of a bitch.
Now that's interesting. Tell me more.
Now this is going to be a good feast.
Now, Dovahkiin! Now he is vulnerable!
Now, what would you like to purchase?
Of course I am. What brings you here?
Oh, Friga Shatter-Shield's old place?
Oh, yes. Hunting is my great passion.
Okay, okay. You've talked me into it.
One group has hidden out in the Pale.
One group has hidden out in the Rift.
One group has hidden out in Whiterun.
Only true Imperials request that one.
Ooohh... The things I could do now...
Our order will not forget your deeds.
Out of my way, or I'll cut you. Deep.
Ow... It hurts when I laugh. He he...
Planning some exciting heists I hope?
Please don't leave. You must help me.
Please give me a chance to try again.
Please hurry. We are counting on you.
Please, I don't have anything to eat.
Please, make sure Winterhold is safe!
Please! Keep that magic away from me.
Put on some clothes, you damned fool.
Right, the leader of the Stormcloaks.
Shadowmere, my old and dear friend...
She'll answer any questions you have.
Shor's Bones! What... what's in this?
Sithis' whisper be upon you, brother.
Skyrim doesn't belong to you, Ulfric.
Slip up and I'll gut you like a fish.
Slow? No. It just ain't there at all.
So how are things with you and Bolli?
So why'd you join up with the Legion?
So, did you still need my assistance?
Somebody get that idiot some armor...
Sorry, mother. I'll focus on my work.
Stop right there! Were I can see you.
Thank you. It would mean a lot to me.
That Empire is dead. And so are you. 
That must have been quite a surprise.
That's it! You're leaving, right now.
The Dawnstar Sanctuary? Whatever for?
The endless sleep comes for us all...
The presence of the living is near...
The streets of Windhelm are now safe.
The throne suits me, don't you think?
There are indeed. Three, to be exact.
There it is again. Did you hear that?
There's nothing more I can teach you.
They're hiding over by those stables!
This is not about your desires, lass.
This will be good training. Let's go!
Thought I told you to run for it! Go!
To arms, brothers! It's the assassin!
Tomorrow. I'll let you know tomorrow.
Ugh. Speak to my husband if you must.
Um, excuse me. Could I buy two leeks.
Umm... Did you want somethin' to eat?
Very good. Come, the people await us.
Very well, I'll keep practicing them.
Very well. I respect your discretion.
Wait! Don't tell me! I want to guess!
Was there anything else she told you?
We can't hold them! Go, Casimir! Run!
We cannot fight the foe in this mist!
We strike tonight, at dusk. Be ready.
We'd better find out what's happened.
We'd better stick together down here.
We'll let it seem like it's his idea.
We're all rich thanks to you. Cheers!
We're outnumbered, but I have a plan.
We're the ones he loves. Me, and you.
Welcome to our stronghold, Blood-Kin.
Well I nearly lost my eyebrows to it.
Well met, friend. How can I help you?
Well, spit it out. What's the matter?
Well, you've come to the right place.
What are you doing? Get off the road!
What brings you all the way out here?
What do you need, love? Ask anything.
What do you want? Have digging to do.
What is it, Drifa? What's the matter?
What is it? I haven't had much sleep.
What is this madness? Rexus, help me!
What would the Empire want in return?
What? How... where did you get these?
What? Oh gods, I don't want to die...
What's happening? No! Leave me alone!
What's in that book? What did it say?
What's the Jarl going to do about it?
What's your wife think of your trips?
Whatever you want. But let's go, now.
Whatever. Just get back to work. Now.
When have I ever been false with you?
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Who knows what we might find in here.
Whoa, now... ease off on the magic...
Why are you speaking to me, Imperial?
Why don't you go in there and get it?
Why, thank you Thonar. I'm flattered.
With you as my muse, how could I not?
Would you like to buy a lady a drink?
Ye gods! You think Alva is a vampire?
Yeah. That's what it's going to take.
Yes, yes. Now to find myself a drink.
You been talking to those Companions?
You can still run. It's not too late.
You have business with Clavicus Vile?
You honor Khajiit with your presence.
You know the old man doesn't like it.
You may even be my champion. Perhaps.
You monster!  I'll kill you for this!
You see what talking to them gets us?
You sure you want it to come to this?
You were born into the pack, brother.
You, you there! Help me, I'm trapped.
You! Back to inflict more pain on me?
You... Dragonborn? Is it really true?
You'd better speak to the Jarl, then.
You'll be wantin' me to pay for them?
You're disgusting, stay away from me.
You're disturbing my other customers.
You're finding it. That's bad enough.
You're on! Loser buys the next round!
You're supposed to be at the meadery.
You're the brute that hurt me before.
You've just written your own epitaph.
Your Voice is strong... for a mortal.
...not dead? Kill them, kill them all!
(Sigh) Let's just kill them both, eh? 
A cup, Dragonborn, to death and glory!
A dragon? It's a dragon! Gods help us!
A word of advice. Don't disappoint me.
Ah, I think that'll do just the trick.
Ah, my friend from Cidhna Mine. Hello.
Ah, my thanks. Malacath watch over ya.
Ah! Here it is. Come, let me show you.
Ahhh... no one will know I'm here now.
All-righty. Good luck out there, boss.
Alms. Give me some meat, you fat Nord!
And just what's that supposed to mean?
And would you raise a mug in her name?
And would you raise a mug in his name?
Annnddd... Point of no return reached.
Another gorgeous gray day, right dear?
Any luck locating those jazbay grapes?
Are we truly sure this is a good idea?
Are you going to let me watch, or not?
As I expected, you favor your friends.
Beautiful things for beautiful people.
But I'm lonely. Will you play with me?
But there isn't any other way through.
But this is supposed to be your work. 
But to be outnumbered twenty to one...
Buy it? This? An Elder Council amulet?
By the Eight?! What... what's in this?
Can I join the Legion when I grow up? 
Can't wait to gut one of those rebels.
Certainly, acolyte. What troubles you?
Citizens! Go home and lock your doors!
Come back whenever you need something.
Come on, show an old man what you got!
Come on! Let's see you put up a fight!
Come! Come and see what goods I offer.
Damn dustmen! Why don't you stay dead?
Damn it, I lost her! Protect the Jarl!
Damn shame to leave that lying around.
Damn soldiers always trample my crops.
Damn, just as I was getting warmed up.
Dead! Someone's going to pay for this.
Dear, that spell is making me nervous.
Dear. You should put that weapon away.
Decided to show up for work today, eh?
Deliver this axe to Ulfric Stormcloak.
Did you see someone run past just now?
Die, World-Eater, in despair and fear!
Doesn't really matter. Thanks, but no.
Don't applaud yourself too soon, worm!
Don't even get me started on that lot.
Don't kill me.... I don't want to die!
Don't see many travelers out this way.
Don't set anything on fire, all right?
Don't worry, Hewnon will let you pass.
Don't worry, I'll stay right with you.
Easy for you to say. You get to fight.
Enemies and ears. Both are everywhere.
Enjoy the city. It will suit you well.
Enough to know that it's not worth it.
Excellent. These should come in handy.
Farengar, very bad idea. Even for you.
Father won't let me go see the dragon.
Feel free to ask me anything you like.
Fighting people is different. Smarter.
Fine, but don't say I didn't warn you.
Fine, Elf-Lover. I'll find her myself.
Fine. Just keep it clean. Here you go.
Follow me. Let's see where this leads.
Forget the list. He goes to the block.
Get your fresh fruit and produce here!
Gods, it's a wonder it's in one piece!
Gold solves most problems, doesn't it?
Good to see you, lass! How are things?
Good! I've got a few scores to settle.
Good. Take this token of my gratitude.
Got a minute? Wanted to say something.
Great. Watch yourself out there, boss.
Guards, get the townspeople to safety!
Has my son Sven asked to join the war?
Have you made a decision about Falion?
Have you not heard that ancient verse?
Have you... gone... completely... mad?
He he. That'll teach the little loony.
Hello, my child. Arkay watch over you.
Hmm? Does someone live among the dead?
Hmmm, you again. What is it this time?
Hope they don't get carried away here.
Hope you didn't catch any of the fire.
How high the mountains of Skyrim rise!
How in Oblivion do we kill this thing?
How's it going? You find anything yet?
Hrongar. Don't be so hard on Avenicci.
Hush, child. Don't pester your cousin.
I am that which you have been seeking.
I assure you that we mean you no harm.
I believe you have a delivery to make.
I believe you owe the Guild something.
I can ask no more. Thank you, my lord!
I can't go any further, Shield-Sister.
I did not ask for that! No more magic.
I didn't say anything about giving up.
I don't know. Someone in town said it.
I don't need to talk to you. Get lost.
I don't think there's a need for that!
I don't want to die. I can't die here!
I have no business with you. Leave me.
I haven't seen you hunting in a while.
I hope you're enjoying the music, sir.
I knew he wasn't gone, I just knew it!
I knew this day would eventually come.
I knew you looked like a clever one...
I know of one. Forgotten. Sequestered.
I mean, someone who's not me, that is.
I really got myself into it this time.
I remember my first feast. I envy you.
I run the forge now. Kind of... scary.
I swear I feel like I'm being watched.
I think her mother, Tova, has the key.
I think something's... wrong... I...  
I told you you wouldn't like the news.
I went out ice fishing a few days ago.
I will make the arrangements, my Jarl.
I would be most impressed to see that.
I'd be grateful. Kolskeggr is my home.
I'd say things couldn't be any better.
I'll be waiting for you at home, then.
I'll get back to court business, then.
I'll teach you to talk to me that way!
I'll water the ground with your blood.
I'm aware of who stole Frost. And why.
I'm gonna go play soldier with a tree!
I'm guessing you're the newcomer then?
I'm not accusing you of anything. Yet.
I'm not allowed to stand on furniture.
I'm not sure if that's a good thing...
I've been hunting on my own for years.
I've failed... the mortal has escaped.
I've got this. Do what you need to do.
I've seen enough. Put on some clothes.
If the crown exists, it will be there.
If you change your mind, I'll be here.
It has. Here, this is your half, love.
It must be the Stormcloaks! Find them!
It was scary. It was like it was real!
It's for sale, if you've got the coin.
It's just this way. Keep following me.
It's time for you to leave, my friend.
It's you and me, prisoner. Stay close!
Just keep moving, you'll wear him out!
Just stay away from her, or...or else.
Keep safe. And always wear your armor.
Keep your brother, and he'll keep you.
Leave now or suffer dire consequences.
Legate. We represent the Emperor here.
Let me know if I can get you anything.
Let's find that Totem, Shield-Brother.
Let's get out of here, fast as we can!
Let's hear it for our kind benefactor!
Let's not talk about this over dinner.
Like inside the Night Mother's coffin.
Listen, father. I've been thinking....
Look... You shouldn't be doing that...
Looks like you weren't followed. Good.
Mama said I could help with the goats!
Mara have mercy that gave me a fright.
Markarth. Is it bloody enough for you?
Maybe we'll have better luck tomorrow.
Most of those don't happen very often.
Mulush. Big Orc fella. Can't miss him.
My coat? What do you need my coat for?
My mother always used to say that too.
My Voice has been silent for too long!
Nah. Just... don't. Leave me outta it.
Name's Valdr. I hunt out of Falkreath.
Nepos is in charge. That's all I know.
Nice doing business with you, friend. 
No, no no no. This can't be happening.
No, no. You're not understanding this.
No! Blackreach was to be my discovery!
No. However, I know someone who might.
None can stand against the Wolf Queen!
Not my thing, but who am I to judge...
Not right now. You bought my last one.
Now go. And give my best to the bride.
Off with ya then. I've got work to do.
Oh it's you. The one from the market. 
Oh look, it's little baby Battle-Born.
Oh yeah, and what would you rather do?
Oh, I'm so glad you changed your mind.
Oh, the fruit looks so good. So juicy.
Oh! Miss Maven. What can I do for you?
Oh! Sounds like I've got a challenger.
Old stonework. Gold, traps, and bones.
On the contrary, you exceed the rest. 
One group has hidden out in Eastmarch.
One group has hidden out in Falkreath.
One group has hidden out in Haafingar.
One group has hidden out in the Reach.
One of these days he'll have to learn.
Our struggle is our people's struggle.
Pahlok joorre! Hin kah fen kos bonaar.
Patience. The body needs time to mend.
Pay me? You think this is about money?
Perhaps I should ask the Ambassador...
Private business, I mean. No visitors.
Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.
Remember... hit the one in the middle!
Resisting arrest will mean your death.
See, that wasn't so difficult, was it.
Shadr, that's so sweet... I'd love to.
Sheathe your weapons and come quietly!
Shor's bones, did it kill them all...?
So congratulations! You're free to go!
So I'm told. Let's see if you impress.
So we take matters into our own hands.
Somewhere up north, in the ice fields.
Soon, Namira's blessing will be yours.
Splendid. Call if you have need of me.
Spoken like a true daughter of Skyrim!
Stay vigilant! Our enemies are legion!
Sure, leave. Not like you care anyway.
Surrender immediately or you both die.
Take care not to set anything on fire.
Take this as a token of our gratitude.
Tell me, sister. Are the stories true?
Tell Shadr he doesn't owe me anything.
Thank you for coming to dinner, Hogni.
Thank you very much for your business.
Thank you. I'll share this with Aerin.
Thank you. The pain is already easing.
Thanks again for the ice wraith teeth.
That looks like it's the last of them.
That sound could bring mountains down!
That sounds lovely. You're very sweet.
That they might get themselves killed.
That was just lying around? Good find.
That would work, except you ain't got.
That's because you always lose... Elf.
That's it. Now, let's get out of here.
That's not for you to decide. Soldier.
That's really none of your business...
That's where we'll find Alduin's Wall.
The afterlife will bring you darkness.
The execution will proceed as planned.
The finest cuts, fresh from the wilds!
The finest jewelry in all of Markarth.
The gold, the jewels... it's all gone.
The joy of battle burns in your heart!
The longer we wait, the worse it gets.
The people still doubt me, don't they.
The roads just aren't safe these days.
The Silver-Blood family will be heard.
The Twilight watches us all, guardian.
Then I have an important task for you.
Then she left to join the Stormcloaks.
Then we understand each other... good.
Then we've no time to lose. Follow me!
Then what are you wasting my time for?
Then you are weak and inconsequential.
There is none who can stand in my way.
There may be a way out, down this way.
There's no gold, nothing shiny at all.
These damn bears are driving me crazy!
They found it! They actually found it!
This is none of your concern, citizen.
This one always sticks... there we go.
This place is getting worse and worse.
This should work. I've done it before.
This wasn't what I wanted. Not at all.
This'll clear up soon, I'm sure of it.
To the block, prisoner. Nice and easy.
Took your sweet time getting it to me.
Trust Septimus. He knows you can know.
Ugor, no! This may be the one we need.
Um, good. We reward loyalty, you know.
Wait. It's okay, my dear. Send her in.
Wait. It's okay, my dear. Send him in.
Was Mallory willing to buy the amulet?
Wasn't by choice, I can tell you that.
We barely have enough for ourselves...
We could use someone with your skills.
We need to get in there and stop this!
We will see if they still remember us.
We'll have to find another way around.
We'll speak again later. If we must...
We'll speak when the Oath is complete.
We've got arms and armor of all kinds.
Welcome back to the temple, messenger.
Well now. I guess I owe you my thanks.
Well, please let me know when you are.
Well, soldier? Are you up to the task?
Well, we can always use contributions.
What about Mercer? Have you asked him?
What can an old skald do for you, huh?
What did you say? Get out of my sight!
What do you suppose this is all about?
What do you think we'll find in there?
What is this, you think you're clever?
What? Where did you hear such a thing?
What's he digging around in there for?
Which brings me to my present concern.
Why aren't you at Honningbrew Meadery?
wordless dragon roar of pain and anger
Yeah, we're all looking for something.
Yep. I have just one question for you.
Yes, I have something special for you.
Yes, son. We should try to capture it.
You a pilgrim or just passing through?
You are likely better informed than I.
You are now ready for your last trial.
You better watch your ass around here.
You chose the wrong girl to mess with.
You got anything in here worth buying?
You have what you came for. Now leave.
You heard the man! Drink and be merry!
You keep your distance with that magic
You know exactly... no. Not this time.
You little twig. I'll snap you in two!
You might make a decent Companion yet.
You mind swinging that somewhere else?
You put those Forsworn down. Good job.
You really think we can kill a dragon?
You see? That's why I didn't tell you!
You were told to find it, weren't you?
You... what? How could you possibly...
You'll have to come back another time.
You're not very good at this, are you.
You're the best! Can you be my father?
You're the best! Can you be my mother?
You're the one with the staff, my boy.
You've come at last! I knew you would!
Your kindness will never be forgotten.
Your objective is the enemy held fort.
...rise from death, Blood of our Blood.
A bit melodramatic, even for you Laila.
A bit of jewelry for your journey home?
A citizen of Skyrim has been kidnapped.
A Septim? As in... a gold coin? Really?
Ah Tekla, you're a pretty little mouse.
Ah the bard-to-be. Did Viarmo send you?
Ah, everybody around here's so serious.
Ah! I feel like I just woke from a nap.
Ah... so tender. Come here, you morsel!
Ahhh. Quite fine my friend. Quite fine.
All these younglings scampering around.
Alright, get the crown off that draugr!
Always good to see someone I can trust.
Amaund Motierre? But that would mean...
And here's your payment for the shards.
And I was so close to being rid of you.
And so, you will die a heretic's death.
And there haven't been any... problems?
And those winds issue from my whispers.
And you think that I care? Interesting.
Apprentice blacksmith, at your service.
Are you kidding me? Look at this place.
As fearless in death as he was in life.
As you can see, it has not yet arrived.
Ask her about it if you want an earful.
Attack me again and I'll hunt you down!
Be careful not to fall on your way out.
Believe, believe, the Dragonborn comes.
Blessing of Arkay to you for your help.
Bow and arrows for the mighty huntsman.
But every now and then, one swims back.
But I still hear the call of the blood.
But I thought there was only one chief.
But regrets are pointless. Here we are.
But you'll understand that soon enough.
But your aunts don't even seem to care.
By order of the Jarl, stop right there!
Can't help you. They're all spoken for.
Clear Namira's sanctuary of the undead.
Come and visit me in Solitude sometime.
Come back anytime if you need a remedy.
Come back as soon as you have the helm.
Come on. Let's see what you're made of.
Damn it, I lost him!  Protect the Jarl!
Damn, that dragon doesn't give up easy.
Depends. Are you thirsty, hungry, both?
Did you want something? I'm quite busy.
Do you have guidance for me, Harbinger?
Don't let Vilkas catch you saying that.
Don't let Viola catch you in her house.
Don't think I don't know what's coming.
Don't try to magic me, you damn wizard.
Dragonborn? What are you talking about?
Draugr. Ain't you ever seen one before?
Everything I've got on display, really.
Excellent. I'll leave you to it, then. 
extremely tired, blocking with a shield
Fancy robes. You a wizard or somethin'?
Finally! My prayers have been answered!
Foolish human. Your time is at its end!
For all I know, the Gourmet is a woman!
For now, give the papers to my Steward.
For now, looking after Joric is my job.
Forget the list. She goes to the block.
Forget the old man. I'll come with you.
Get over there and see what you can do.
Good job. Please accept this in return.
Good luck, brother. I'll see you later.
Good luck. I'll be here if you need me.
Good, my clients are gettin' impatient.
Good, now maybe I can get back to work.
Good! Let's go find something to fight.
Good. Let's hope it's a lesson learned.
Got lots of jobs available. Interested?
Ha! Surely you're pulling Cicero's leg!
Ha! Well, I certainly do feel that way.
Had only Mara saved that poor animal...
Haming, you need to get over here. Now!
Have you found out anything about Alva?
Have you returned, Aren? My old friend?
Haven't heard from him in a long while.
He is rather handsome though, isn't he?
Hello, Silana. Would you like an apple?
Here in Shor's house we honor it still.
Here you go. Hope you don't muck it up.
Hey look, a cave. Wonder what's inside?
Hey now, don't take all the good stuff!
Hey now, you be careful with that fire.
Hjalti? Is that you? I've been waiting.
Hmm. The gate below still looks closed.
Hmm... these are interesting reports...
Hmph. I don't talk with Guild traitors.
Hogni Red-Arm, more like Hogni Fat-Arm.
How are things at the Meadery, my dear?
How do you put up with that fop Fihada?
I almost died in a ruin just like this.
I am the hunts-wife of this stronghold.
I applaud anyone who assists the court.
I can feel you laughing behind my back.
I can't believe I just met the Gourmet!
I can't believe this is happening, lad.
I can't go any further, Shield-Brother.
I can't imagine Skald ever being young.
I don't have time to talk. Keep moving!
I don't know, but he sounded impatient.
I find your wolfish grin... unsettling.
I have nothing to say to that murderer.
I have the Lexicon! Where's the podium?
I have work if you've got the backbone.
I hope not. That ring is irreplaceable.
I hope someone knows where we're going.
I hope the Caller turns you inside out!
I hope you come up with that gold soon.
I hope you're enjoying yourself, ma'am.
I just want to make sure I'm moving up.
I know what I'm doing. Stop telling me.
I may be old, but I can put up a fight!
I see you are eager to carry the light.
I see... Give the papers to my Steward.
I think I can teach you a thing or two.
I think I see what I was doing wrong...
I think I'm going to get another drink.
I think it's time for you to get going.
I think you might be looking for Enmon.
I thought today was going to be boring.
I told you my sister would help us out.
I will feast on your soul in Sovngarde!
I will serve Dawnstar as I always have.
I. I don't know, it wasn't me. I swear!
I'll make the preparations immediately!
I'm a mage, not a pawnbroker, you know.
I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
I'm not interested in fighting anymore.
I'm not the only one seeing this, am I?
I'm prepared to negotiate my surrender!
I'm so glad Eola invited you to dinner.
I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen.
I'm still amazed that your plan worked.
I've already told him. I don't have it!
I've been working on a shield for Aela.
If only Savos were alive to see this...
If you get arrested, it's on your head.
If you need a drink, just say the word.
If you prefer I took my men and left...
If you want to know that bad then fine.
Indeed. Come, there is much to be done.
Inn's closed. Bar's still open, though.
Interest you in some marksman training?
Interesting. I'll look it over. Thanks.
Is there something I can help you with?
Is there... something I can do for you?
It should be careful with those flames.
It was lost years ago in a Dwemer ruin.
It will keep it's hands to itself, yes?
It's all in the swing. Let me show you.
It's bad luck to talk about that place.
It's good to see you in one piece, lad!
It's just a dream, child. Nothing more.
It's not confusing... just frustrating.
It's time. The Skull must be destroyed.
Keep to the shadows and you'll do fine.
Khajiit is ready for any troublemakers.
Leave this place... Leave this place...
Let me see if I can get that door open.
Let's get out of here, for pity's sake!
Let's try a lute piece. Follow along...
Like to see him laugh his way out that.
Look at me when I'm talking to you, eh?
Look over there. That's a dwarven ruin.
Lust can make a man do the unthinkable.
Mara bless you for agreeing to help us.
May the Eight guide you to the Phial...
May your time in Falkreath be pleasant.
Mind your manners in this hall, friend.
My brother in crime... what'd you need?
Next to the door, the room on the left.
Nice weather for a ride. Hope it lasts.
No pushing, no shoving. Plenty of room!
No, but his housecarl sent us a letter.
No, I'm not a rebel. You can't do this!
No, not that it's any of your business.
No. Even Ranmir can only drink so much.
Nord stonework. Thousands of years old.
Not now. I'm... much too upset to talk.
Not too full on bread and wine, I hope?
Now don't get all upset. Here. Take it.
Now is not a good time. Leave me alone.
Now it's time to use all three at once.
Now that's something else, right there!
Now we can get back to work. Thank you.
Now we can put this all behind us, hmm?
Now, as for your wish... Power, was it?
Oh really? And where were you thinking?
Oh, splendid! I can't wait to use them.
Oh? Well, I won't turn down your money.
Oho! Manservant? Is that what I am now?
One group has hidden out in Hjaalmarch.
One group has hidden out in Winterhold.
Our wedding is soon. I'll see you then!
Outrageous! Who does she think she is?!
Owning a farm does have its advantages.
Pa always says good men need few words.
Please tell me you have news of my son.
Please, let's not have it come to that.
Quicksilver ore is rare. Worth digging.
Really, I think there's been a mistake.
Really? Was it big? Did it breath fire?
Remain vigilant and don't trust anyone.
Remind us of our place, when we forget.
Rest well and sleep deeply, my brother.
Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.
Seems I still remember my old training.
Seems there's always more to be done...
Shameful, really. I blame the parents. 
Shoo! Go away! You get nothing from me.
Shor's bones, boy. What did I tell you?
Shor's Bones! Look at that monstrosity.
Should have known you'd be a cheap one.
Sister, how is my fortune coming along?
So I'm, uh... writing a song for you...
So long [QUOTE]friend.[QUOTE] Ha ha ha!
So we'll be needing fresh horses, then?
So, have you thought about what I said?
Something in Winterhold, it looks like.
Soon you will know the cold of death...
Stand together and we shall defeat him!
Stay alert. They may not have gone far.
Still, I fear there is some connection.
Strike us with the power of your Voice.
Take care of yourself, Orgnar. Goodbye.
Tell me, brother. Are the stories true?
Tell me, Vignar. Was all this worth it?
Thalmor dog! Death is too good for you.
Thank you for your role in all of this.
Thank you. Umm, blessings upon you too.
Thanks. You take care of yourself, now.
That damn fool! I should ring her neck!
That we could avoid having to kill you.
That's a dangerous game you're playing.
That's a fair price. My blade is yours.
That's a little... showy, even for you.
That's all for today. You're dismissed.
That's it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
That's no small amount of coin, friend.
The Divines smile on a charitable soul.
The Elder Scrolls told of their return.
The kind men use to measure themselves.
The silence became almost... maddening.
The spiders put you through the ringer?
The Thalmor need to be taught a lesson.
The trial awaits. Are you now prepared?
Then back home is where you'll find me.
Then we got nothin' more to talk about.
Then you are fool, and will die for it.
There is no escape. Courage is useless.
There should be a way to turn this off.
There's an old man. He lives in Riften.
There's got to be some way out of here!
These boys do good work for the Empire!
These dreams are real I tell you. Real!
They seem to when you're around Silana.
They're over there, next to that house!
Things are looking up around here, lad.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
This is it. We've found Gathrik's tomb.
This is the best news I've ever gotten!
This is the longest day I can remember.
This one suggests donning some apparel.
Tradition is very important to me, son.
Until our next meeting, honored friend.
Uuh. Would you mind dousing that magic?
Vals Veran will die for what he's done.
Vegetables are the food of the Divines.
Very much so, and thank you for asking.
Was that some sort of... healing spell?
Watch your feet. We just cleaned there!
We agreed to 750 gold. I want my money.
We are ready to mount our final attack.
We are the rightful rulers of Markarth!
We can speak after the ceremony's done.
We can trade in the morning, outlander.
We could always look for another brand.
We destroyed those Stormcloak traitors!
We will see if you truly have the gift.
We'll keep peace and order in Dawnstar.
We'll meet again in Sovngarde, brother.
We've no need for wizards in our midst!
Welcome to the Winking Skeever, friend.
Well I'll be! That'd be a sight to see.
Well, right. One of us will be a chief.
What does it take to kill this monster?
What exactly are we talking about here?
What exactly did this amulet look like?
What have we gotten ourselves into now?
What if he's right? Maybe I'll buy one.
What? An intruder? Attack, my lovelies!
What? There's a whole shift down there!
What's she digging around in there for?
Where are you... get me down from this!
Who needs customers and their old junk?
Why aren't you at your post, Justiciar?
Why, thank you. You are most courteous.
Why? You think it's funny or something?
Wonder what they mine from these walls.
Worship of Talos is strictly forbidden.
Yes, but I am honor-bound to stay here.
Yes, but not likely the one you intend.
Yes, father. Which cask should we open?
Yes, I was bored talking to you anyway.
Yes, yes. This will create a fine fume.
Yes, yes. We should proceed cautiously.
You are exactly what I was looking for.
You are worthy. The knowledge is yours.
You dare challenge a child of Malacath?
You like Skeever liver. No? Tough luck.
You look awful. Better not get me sick.
You must feel the Word within yourself.
You need to stay inside the boundaries.
You serve your time by digging. So dig.
You there. What do you know about this?
You would? Oh, that would be wonderful.
You're losing this war and you know it.
You're not in here for life, like I am.
You're the one Mazzaka described to me.
You're the one with the staff, my dear.
You're threatening me? Oh, that's rich!
Ysmir's beard! She's...she's a vampire!
Zu'u uth nall thurri dein daar miiraak.
A little coin always greases the wheels.
Again, as one! The World-Eater fears us!
Again? Buy some food this time will you?
Ah, a test subject! Go, my pets! Attack!
Ah, another plaything for my collection.
Ah, yes! There it is! Thank you so much.
Ah. No, that was not supposed to happen.
All right, all right. I'll speak to her.
All right. I'll lay off him. Just leave.
All right. I'll tell you a little story.
All will happen as it has been foretold.
Always a pleasure. What brings you back?
Am I to take your silence as acceptance?
And just what do you think you're doing?
And now you've found me. Can I help you?
And sabotage enemy controlled resources.
Another soul claimed for Lady Nocturnal!
As you wish. Just don't forget about me.
At last, the treasure is mine! All mine!
Aye, lass... and we'll be ready for him.
Aye, that's the work of Septimus Signus.
Back from a job, huh? Hope it went well.
Behold, the future. Behold, the Thalmor!
Bet I can down this ale faster than you!
Big talk for someone with a light purse.
Blessed are the forgotten. The wretched.
But I need your help. We need your help.
But you and I are going to reclaim them.
By a bold stroke, you bested me, friend.
By Nocturnal's grace, I will defeat you!
By the Ashpit, we can't go on like this.
Call upon me if I can be of any service.
Can you tell me more about what you saw?
Careful not to torch anything important.
Certainly you don't believe such things?
clearing throat - no subtitles displayed
Come and see what is for sale, traveler.
Come back to me if you change your mind.
Come in, come in! Make yourself at home!
Come on, move it. We have Nords to kill.
Come on. We've got to get to Kynesgrove.
Damn. No way to open this from our side.
Damned wizards and their damned magic...
Danger's about, I can tell. Be cautious.
Did you find anything at Wolfskull Cave?
Did you just wander in out of the white?
Do be careful with that spell, will you?
Do you know the way? I'm weary and lost.
Do you wish to test yourself against me?
Don't bother, Clavicus won't talk to me.
Don't come back until you have the ring.
Don't have much to say to you. Got work.
Don't just stand there! Kill that thing!
Don't let my sister do anything foolish.
Don't mind if you do. What's your price?
Don't start swinging that thing in here.
Don't you remember? His name is Hroggar.
Door's over there. Why don't you use it?
Easy. I'll sell. Just don't hurt anyone.
Everybody ready? We charge on my signal.
Execute every last bandit. Spare no one.
Falkreath is a fine place to be, Bolund.
Fastred, I have something to say to you.
Father, I'm worried about Gadba and Mul.
Fine, you win. Take the horse and leave.
Fine. Take your books and leave at once.
Fire is not a thing to be played with...
Forget it. I don't do that kind of work.
Gal like you needs a warhorse, I reckon.
Get on your way before I change my mind.
Get out of here or I'll call the guards!
Gettin' dull. We'll need a new one soon.
Go cast your fancy magic someplace else.
Go, incinerate some poor bastard for me.
Good luck. I hope you get there in time.
Good. Then there isn't much more to say.
Ha! Humor is often in short supply here.
Ha! I've suffered worse during training!
Have you heard about Goldenglow Meadery?
He's in the Flagon right now. Get ready.
He's perfectly polite, if a bit guarded.
Here to purchase some armor or a weapon?
Here to shame an old woman? Leave me be.
Here's something to consider, Mirabelle.
Hey! Where did I go? I can't see myself!
Honored Companion. How can I assist you?
How long have you run this place, again?
Hrongar won't give us a straight answer.
I believe I've made myself rather clear.
I can't believe this is happening, lass.
I can't believe you're doing this! Stop!
I didn't do it! You saw! I didn't do it!
I don't suppose it matters much anymore.
I don't think going back is a good idea.
I feel like I can take on all of Skyrim.
I feel wonderful, just like every night.
I have feasted on many greater than you.
I have little need for mindless thralls.
I hope life's treating you well, friend.
I hope the tome we need is still intact.
I hope we haven't just created a martyr.
I hope you have good news for Mirabelle.
I hope you're enjoying the music, ma'am.
I hope you're not expecting a thank you.
I just need to gather some more potions.
I knew it was at the Dead Man's Respite.
I know your kind, always sneaking about.
I mean it! I'll... I'll cut you in half!
I never thought I'd see Kolskeggr again.
I promise I'll help you get out of here.
I should get back to memorizing recipes.
I thought I heard footsteps. Be careful.
I thought we had a guard posted outside.
I told you we should have hired a thief.
I trust the day's found you well, thane.
I was afraid you were going to say that.
I was only trying to help you, you know!
I wish I could play with fire like that.
I wouldn't stay here long if I were you.
I... I'm sorry Haelga, I can't. Not yet.
I... it's like waking up out of a dream.
I'll gladly share my knowledge with you.
I'll go gather the men in the courtyard.
I'll pay you to hurt someone else. Okay?
I'll see you at Northwatch Keep, friend.
I'm glad to assist you in any way I can.
I'm proud to call a man like you friend.
I'm sorry, but you're not leaving alive.
I'm sorry, could you describe the smell?
I'm through with you. Get out of my way.
I've been waiting for you, my sweet one.
Impressive, you've mastered the shadows.
In some cases, a few never awoke at all.
In time, he brought me here. To the box.
Is Hert his sister or his wife? Or both?
Is that... fur? Coming out of your ears?
It's all about sizing up your mark, lad.
It's going to take a lot more than that.
It's good to see you in one piece, lass!
It's got to be the Imperials! Find them!
It's just ahead. Please, keep following.
It's not an insult, just an observation.
It's the leaving that's hardest, I know.
J'zargo has seen that Tolfdir likes you.
Joor mey! What are you doing back there?
Just come back alive, and I'll be happy.
Keep going, Casimir! Release the Miasma!
Keep it. Not worth going to prison over.
Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.
Kynareth save us, here he comes again...
Large diagonal cut from left shoulder...
Lead on. Skjor's already scouting ahead.
Leave here. Leave here and never return.
Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm upset?
Let the Dragonborn be the one to do it. 
Let us walk in the steps of the Divines.
Let's get the axe and be done with this.
Look around here. There's not much left.
Mama, can we talk. You know, about papa?
Man like you needs a warhorse, I reckon.
Many folk think he set the fire himself.
Maul, can I ask a personal favor of you?
May all your possible futures be bright.
May you sword feast on Stormcloak flesh.
Maybe he's looking for something to eat?
Mercer, aren't you forgetting something?
Mortal fool! No one hides from the dead!
Mutual advantage! Any fool can see that.
My brother was the best man in Solitude.
My carriage is the safest way to travel.
My miners are as dumb as rocks are grey.
My mouth goes dry, and I start to shake.
Need a dagger? No? How about a claymore?
Need a room? Maybe a drink? You name it.
Never see me strutting around like that!
No matter what, the College will endure.
No matter, I appreciate your generosity.
No more than anyone else, I don't think.
No, it's fine. I don't mind being poor. 
No, no. Mercer wants him alive, for now.
Nope. Sold my last one to some stranger.
Not scared of an old woman now, are you?
Not while I'm still breathing, it's not.
Now maybe we can put all this behind us.
Now that that's settled, may we proceed?
Of course not. My spirit remains strong.
Of course you will. I have commanded it!
Of course. How are you in a battle, boy?
Of course. I would have it no other way.
Off for some wine, eh? Drink one for me.
Oh dear. That wasn't supposed to happen.
Oh, very well. Probably safest that way.
Okay, now where did I put those spiders?
One of the Jarls has asked for our help.
Please, ma'am, I've got nowhere to go...
Raise the alarm! We've been infiltrated!
Really? That would be a pleasant change.
Shahvee would be in your debt, kind one.
Shor's bones, girl. What did I tell you?
Shor's bones, what happened to you, boy?
Shor's Hall awaits, if worthy you prove.
So go dig at the other corner for a bit.
So I like to have a little fun, so what?
So it's done. You've killed the Gourmet.
So what do you think about it all, then?
Somehow I doubt that will persuade them.
Someone's going to get hurt, all right. 
Sounds like easy money to me. You're on.
Speak. You can ask anything of me, love.
Stop by my stall in the market sometime.
Stop that! Keep your spells to yourself.
Such a shame. Perhaps another time then.
Sure, that'll do just fine. Go on ahead.
Thank you for your help. You may go now.
Thank you. I appreciate your assistance.
That dark elf is about to be a dead elf.
That's it. I'm placing you under arrest.
That's not the Skyrim I want to live in.
That's quite an opening demand, Tullius.
The dragons will surely fear your Voice.
The Dreth family doesn't steal, Indaryn.
The East Empire Company is in your debt.
The Empire I remember never surrendered.
The Legion is here! Defend the entrance!
The waiting... the insufferable waiting.
Then we have nothing more to talk about.
There is much for J'zargo to be sure of.
There's no way out that way, you know...
These Thalmor know how to treat a guest.
They call her [QUOTE]the Skinner.[QUOTE]
They call him [QUOTE]the Skinner.[QUOTE]
Things are looking up around here, lass.
This seems like a really bad idea to me.
Time for you humans to learn your place!
Time to cleanse the Empire of its filth.
Time to show what you're really made of.
Travel safely. It's dangerous out there.
Ugh! Only a fool tries to kill the dead!
Wabbajack Wabbajack Wabbajack Wabbajack.
Wait, I can still fight. No, no I can't.
Was there something specific you needed?
We are the sons and daughters of Skyrim!
We can trade when there's light outside.
We forge every day if you need anything.
We lost another five guardsmen, my Jarl.
We need to find out what Ancano's up to.
We shouldn't have left her there to die!
We will make do somehow. We always have.
We're wise to your scheming, you coward.
Welcome to the Imperial Legion, soldier.
Welcome, sister. Please, enjoy yourself.
Well someone has to provide around here.
Well, I've certainly heard worse things.
Well, that's the good and the bad of it.
Well? Is everything out there all right?
Wha... what? Oh, it's one of you people.
What about them? They seem loyal enough.
What in the Eight Divines is this thing?
What's going on? What happened in there?
What's he rummaging around in there for?
What's your business here in Winterhold?
Whatcha gonna do? Huh? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying.
Where's Elvali? She was right behind me.
Which is why I brought the Elder Scroll.
Who enters? Will nobody save poor Melka?
Who would like to open the negotiations?
Why didn't you tell me? What did he say?
Wizard! Hiding over there by that fence!
Won't be 'some other time' at this rate.
Word certainly travels fast, doesn't it?
Yes, Housecarl. We'll leave immediately.
Yes, my son, what is it I can help with?
Yes, yes. Closer. I won't bite. Promise.
You are but a dog, and I am your master!
You are looking after your brother, yes?
You are new here. I don't trust the new.
You bested me, an Orc chief. Impressive.
You can tell Shadr his debt's been paid.
You caught me! I surrender! Ha ha ha ha.
You don't have what it takes to kill me.
You don't impress me. So don't even try.
You have done the world a great service.
You know you can afford a septim or two.
You must excuse me. I shouldn't be here.
You must first prove you are in control.
You performed your duties to the letter.
You still need to prove yourself, whelp.
You talked Torbjorn down? I'm impressed.
You there! That was uninvited. No more. 
You'd rather be plowing a field? Not me.
You'll need Kahvozein's Fang, of course.
You're back. Have you done what I asked?
You're losing this war, and you know it.
You're that visitor, been pokin' around.
Your fists speak louder than your words.
Your training proceeds well, Dragonborn.
Zu'u Alduin, zok sahrot do naan ko Lein.
A citizen of the Pale has been kidnapped.
A citizen of the Rift has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Whiterun has been kidnapped.
A dragon? Please. Don't make up nonsense.
A few septims for my supper is all I ask.
A group of them has holed up in the Pale.
A group of them has holed up in the Rift.
A group of them has holed up in Whiterun.
A new face. And a right fair one at that.
A Nord's last thoughts should be of home.
Ah! Are you planning on hurting me again?
Ah! I'm just an old woman. Don't hurt me.
All right. Take this and get out of here.
Always another big meal to cook. Figures.
Ancano! Stop this at once! I command you!
And a whole lot of good that's gotten us.
And how may Ma'randru-jo assist you, hmm?
And lead the Companions to further glory.
And now Titus Mede II is as good as dead.
And you thought I was just a pretty face.
Any healing potion will do. Please hurry.
Are you prepared to make that commitment?
Are you ready to for Serpentstone Island?
As long as those orders came from Ulfric.
At least it's more money for the College.
Ataf, please play back that piece for me.
Aye, lass... and I've come to a decision.
Balgruuf won't give us a straight answer.
barking angrily - someone he doesn't like
Being Housecarl of Falkreath is an honor.
Better men have tried. Let's finish this.
Blades to kill your prey and your rivals.
Born and raised right here in Rorikstead.
But first, you were introducing yourself.
But his chocolate pate gives me the runs.
But just in case, I'll be ready for them.
Buy some armor and live to tell about it!
By Talos, Mercer has a lot to answer for.
Can you... can you possibly help J'zargo?
Cave up ahead. Trouble or maybe treasure?
Changed the linens myself. They're fresh.
Come back when you've got the gold, then.
Come mortal, let's end this here and now!
Come on, think about it. She'd reward us!
Come quietly or taste the Jarl's justice!
Come with us. We need to get out of here.
Come, at the very least walk out with me.
Come, Dragonborn. Attend to Master Borri.
Consider me your new friend in the north.
Damn it, man, are you trying to taunt us?
Damn shame, Roggvir. You were a good man.
Death is the only way out of your misery!
Deliver this axe to Balgruuf the Greater.
Did something happen at the Pawned Prawn?
Die now and await your fate in Sovngarde!
Do that and I'll make sure you get a cut.
Do you have anything even remotely fresh?
Do you have news? Did you find something?
Do you want me to hold your hand as well?
Don't believe everything you hear, child.
Don't go setting the place on fire, okay?
Don't listen to him, he's making this up.
Don't you see? I am master of the arcane!
Dwarven metalwork. So much wasted effort.
Enjoy your stay, and don't break nothin'!
Enjoying your newfound abilities I trust?
Everybody pushes me around. Well no more!
Everything's in order. Welcome back, sir.
Excellent. I have a couple tasks for you.
Excuse me? What kind of question is that?
Explore the facets of the infinite jewel.
Face your death with some courage, thief.
Father, you worry too much. I'll be fine.
Figures. You elders are always so boring.
Fine, but we'll be keeping an eye on you.
Fine. Here's everything you need to know.
Fine. I guess you'll need your coin then.
Fine. It'll be five septims to repair it.
For this reason, I avoid them when I can.
Gah! Look over there. I can't believe it.
Get out of here before I call the guards!
Get to the College, before it's too late!
Give him one more week to think about it.
Go now. Return to your pathetic pursuits.
Go on now. Time to get your hands bloody.
Go on, Hadvar. Let's hear the rest of it.
Go on, then. Deliver my message to Sibbi.
Gods damn those Forsworn. So many dead...
Good idea. Let me know when you're ready.
Good to hear. Have your share of the pay.
Good, good. She didn't see you take them?
Good. I can always count on you, can't I?
Good. I have some things that need doing.
Good. Now shut up and get out of my face.
Got the fleetest steeds in all o' Skyrim.
Ha! Skyrim will never bow to the Thalmor!
Hadring got himself another customer, eh?
Have you found proof of Alva's treachery?
Have you heard from your family recently?
He can't treat me like that. He needs me.
Heard about you and your honeyed words...
Here's your payment. Well earned, indeed.
Hey! You trying to pull a fast one on me?
His real name is Gulum-Ei. Slimy bastard.
Hmm. I could be a great hunter like this.
How should I know? I don't work for them.
Hurry back... and bring more merchandise.
I beg you, don't go into Silus's museum. 
I bet your family would be amazed, right?
I can't believe any of this is happening!
I can't keep helping you with everything.
I didn't know you were so cold-blooded...
I don't believe you. That's not your way.
I don't even know who they said I killed.
I don't think I like where this is going.
I don't think so. Clean up your own mess.
I don't understand. Why can't we go home?
I figured you had it in you. Nicely done.
I got some fine armor, if you're lookin'.
I haven't figured it out yet, but I will.
I haven't heard that name in a long time.
I help in the mines as well as the forge.
I hold my own beliefs, but thanks anyway.
I hope to see you in Windhelm. Good luck.
I just don't know if I can keep you safe.
I miss her, too, but I'm glad she's safe.
I suppose I should return to my papers...
I used to be a member of the Morang Tong.
I value my privacy. So if you don't mind?
I wonder what they were mining down here.
I wondered if I could ask a favor of you.
I work for the Silver-Bloods. Help clean.
I'll be amazed if any of us survive this.
I'll fight and die, if such fate is mine.
I'll find some coin for you. I always do.
I'll pay you back, if it means that much.
I'll, uh, just take that as a compliment.
I'm busy. Don't you have something to do?
I'm done for, little cub. Go. Run for it!
I'm not quite ready to let go of my wife.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm sure she'll be angry. Brace yourself.
I'm sure you two will get along famously.
I'm telling you, this one is different...
I'm tired, I haven't slept well in weeks.
I've never seen anything quite like that.
If I die today, it will not be in terror.
If you can find me first, I can tell you.
If you fancy a bit of music, let me know.
If you locate her, find us in Rorikstead.
In the basement. Trust me, you'll see it.
In the depths of Blackreach one yet lies.
Is everyone here? Let's get this started.
Is there anything else I can get for you?
It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
It lick the panes and smokes the glass...
It was the first lesson Gallus taught us.
It's all about sizing up your mark, lass.
It's all on account of this blasted ring.
It's been an honor to serve you, brother.
It's very particular, and very important.
Just calm down. I'll tell you everything.
Just keep at it, or Mulush will beat you.
Keep your arrows in their quiver, archer.
Keep your eyes on him, he's quite crafty.
Khajiit welcomes you, and also your coin.
Let me know if you need something forged.
Let me know if you see anything you like.
Let's continue, we still have much to do.
Let's hope we both live through this day.
Looking for some armor? A weapon perhaps?
Looking to stay alive? Why take a chance?
Madesi, what's this bill for 300 septims!
Many thanks. Here - a token of gratitude.
May Kynareth's winds blow you to fortune.
May your bed be warm and your food sweet.
Maybe if I don't talk, they won't either.
Maybe one of these Imperials had the key.
Maybe she's looking for something to eat?
Maybe you could be a taster or something.
Men aren't good or bad. They're just men.
Might even give you a bit of gold for it.
Mother says I shouldn't talk to people...
My blade is restless, unblooded too long.
My father owned it until he... passed on.
My Jarl, we need to discuss the Forsworn.
My pay will be nothing if we die in here!
My word, look at those ruins. Remarkable.
Need a horse? Talk to my father, Skulvar.
Never trade a sword for a hoe, my friend.
No doubt exactly as the Thalmor intended.
No Firebrand Wine yet? How disappointing.
No politics, Thongvor. I told you before.
No, I don't think that will be necessary.
Nothing, Ragnar. Please... don't hurt me.
Now we never talk about it again. Got it?
Now, cast the ward spell, and keep it up.
Nowhere to hide! Hunter becomes our prey!
Of course not. I never thought otherwise.
Of course, Julienne. What's on your mind?
Of course. How are you in a battle, girl?
Oh my, that's quite a difficult question.
Oh yes, mum. I'll make sure it gets done.
Oh, I should've known she'd try it again!
Oh, it's you. Not here to rob me are you?
Oho! I thought you'd never figure it out.
Okay. Stand very still. This might sting.
Only now... Well, it's simply a disaster.
Onmund's amulet in exchange for my staff.
Our stock of arrows is running a bit low.
Ours is to smile at your passing, friend.
Passing on a golden opportunity is worse.
Pay attention, you could learn something.
Picking through garbage. Has he no shame?
Please, get that to Avulstein right away.
Please, oh please, I don't want to die...
Psijics? Here now? What in Talos' name...
Ralof! You damned traitor. Out of my way!
Really? I wrote that off a long time ago.
Return with the gauntlets, or not at all.
Ripe fruit and fresh vegetables for sale!
Shall Alduin remain so long unchallenged?
She's in the Flagon right now. Get ready.
Shouldn't you be on your way to Whiterun?
So if you don't have any business. Leave.
So, can I interest you in anything today?
So, what is the first special ingredient?
So, you wish to master the arcane arts...
Some day I'm going to forge my own sword!
Some parting advice - women love sonnets.
Someone put an arrow in that damn wizard!
Something is wrong. There is an intruder.
Something you need, you miserable wretch?
Sometimes I just like to watch them burn.
Sorry, but I have a treasure to get to...
Sorry, but you don't exactly belong here.
Spare a coin? Talos rewards the generous.
Spiced wine for ya? It's a family recipe.
Stendarr's Light purify you of your ills.
Surely you have something better to do...
Talk to my parents if you need something.
Tell Shadr I'm forgetting about his debt.
Ten more would keep me stocked for a bit.
That wasn't a fight, it was an execution.
That'll do. She's all saddled up for you.
That's a decent weapon you've made there.
That's a fine potion you've put together.
That's it! We'll bring that bastard down!
That's not something you see every day...
That's the North Gate in case you forget.
The Jarl is... tired. Be mindful of that.
The prisoners are in rare form, as usual.
The roads of Skyrim lead to many dangers.
The sooner you remember that, the better.
The spirit world is strong in this place.
The stench... this place reeks of Falmer.
The streets are safer now, thanks to you.
The temple is still not clean. Get to it.
The way out is right there! Run, damn it!
The wedding is soon. It'll be a good day.
The wind blows bitter cold in this place.
Then come back when you've got that much.
Then let them die with their false kings.
They got archers over there by the fence!
They're crazy. Think they rule the Reach.
Think I'm defenseless? Well you're wrong!
This better be important, I'm quite busy.
This city is corrupt! You're all corrupt!
This is... he should not have gone alone.
This should compensate you for your find.
Troll's blood, what happened to you Pavo?
Try to relax. You'll be well soon enough.
Uh... why don't we talk about this later?
Uhhh... (coughing, wheezing) ... ahhhh...
Until our next meeting, if such is fated.
Until then, we have quite the task ahead.
Use it right, and you won't feel a thing.
We don't want your kind here, dark elves!
We hardly ever get new customers anymore.
We have a relationship of mutual respect.
We stay together, no matter what. Agreed?
We're not supposed to talk to the guests.
We're safe here now. But what of Morthal?
We've got an assassin! Check the shadows!
Welcome, brother. Please, enjoy yourself.
Well done. Here, a token of appreciation.
Well done. They never knew what hit them.
Well which is it? Look farther or closer?
Well, I know she thinks the world of you.
Well, we'd better get back to our rounds.
What brings you back to Nightingale Hall?
What do you think these devices were for?
What I am doing is none of your business!
What in the name of Oblivion do you want?
What sort of harm? Have you had a vision?
What was that? Some kind of foreign move?
What would you have me do, then? Nothing?
What? You did? Oh sweet Divines! You did!
What's going on out there? What happened?
What's happening? What did you people do?
What's he doing poking his nose in there?
What's she rummaging around in there for?
Whatever you're peddling, I'm not buying.
Who else gains from that but the Thalmor?
Who knows, maybe he's in a generous mood.
Whoa! They killed Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
With you by my side, is that right Horik?
Wow! Look at that robe. Are you a wizard?
Yeah. Threw it in the lake like you said.
Yeah... fired. Sure. That's what I meant.
Yes, I think you'll be just what I need. 
Yes, quite a shame. It was a fine weapon.
Yes, that'd be entirely out of character.
Yes, yes. I have a lot of research to do.
Yes. So now you don't have to go, do you?
You ants don't have the power to bind me!
You are an inspiration. Do you know that?
You are human again. Like the rest of us.
You damn gray-skin. Go back to Morrowind!
You didn't have to help me, so... thanks.
You don't have enough to earn my loyalty.
You made your decision. Now live with it.
You may as well give up, I see you there.
You must be very skilled with magic, yes?
You need my strength again, I'll be home.
You Nords and your bloody sense of honor.
You should run while you have the chance.
You were given a vision? Are you serious?
You were there for Roggvir's execution...
You weren't. There's just not much to it.
You will be my blood offering to Morvath!
You'll be the toast of Whiterun for this!
You're a very pretty young woman, Rhiada.
You're kinda fuzzy. What's wrong with ya?
You're only young once. Trust me, I know.
You're taking us somewhere warm, I trust?
You've breathed your last breath, mortal!
You've done it. The shrine is ours again.
You've returned! I'm hoping successfully.
Your ancestors wouldn't want this, Silus!
Your blood is such a pretty shade of red!
Your feeble attempt to hide is insulting!
(Sounds of unlocking and unbarring a door)
A citizen of Eastmarch has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Falkreath has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Haafingar has been kidnapped.
A citizen of the Reach has been kidnapped.
A dragon.... First in a thousand years....
A group of them has holed up in Eastmarch.
A group of them has holed up in Falkreath.
A group of them has holed up in Haafingar.
A group of them has holed up in the Reach.
A tragic, and very, very profitable event.
Absolutely. Did you still want to buy one?
Ah, you're back. What have you discovered?
Ah! I am now like the Shadowscales of old.
Ain't used to strangers here in Riverwood.
Alive.... You're alive... Thank Sithis... 
All right, then. We'll get together later.
And a Nord knows a liar when she sees one.
And here we all are. Shall we step inside?
And then, the tragedy with Hroggar's home.
And yet none of us can pick a damned lock.
Another day, another opportunity to learn!
Any friend of Ralof's is a friend of mine.
Any luck getting the marks from those men?
Anything else before you make the journey?
Are you all right? What happened in there?
Are you one of them? Please don't hurt me.
Are you quite sure we need to be speaking?
Are you worried the Forsworn might return?
As of yet, there has been no sign of them.
Back, eh? And how was our friend Calcelmo?
Be well. Pray for Solitude and my husband.
Besides, Jarl Laila will never agree to...
Bested by a fool. Who's the fool now, hmm?
Bit late to be wandering around, isn't it?
Blessings of the moons upon you, traveler.
Business is absolutely booming, my friend.
But to invade my home, kidnap my family...
By Her Benevolence, you shall not stop us!
By long tradition, the elder speaks first.
By the gods, did that really just happen?!
By the gods! What manner of power is that?
By Ysmir, you did it. You killed a dragon.
Can any man hope to be ready for a dragon?
Can't you just tell me if the grip is bad?
Come in, come in. Too many ears out there.
Come on now, boy, you know what I meant...
Come on, Brynjolf... what is it this time?
Come on, what are trying to do? Insult me?
Come on. Show me you've got what it takes!
Come with me. Our feast is about to begin.
Come, Galmar. We've still much work to do.
Cut me down, or you'll never get the claw!
Damn it! Sorry. I'm not very good at this.
Damn Madanach. Damn his Forsworn backside.
Daughter. Who is this you have brought me?
Delvin, please tell me you have good news.
Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me.
Divines, I'm tired. This is too much work.
Do try not to set off any traps, will you?
Dohaviin, your Voice is no match for mine!
Don't make me bring your father into this.
Don't try to haggle with me. Buy or leave.
Don't you go pulling my leg. Give it here.
Don't you know there's a dragon attacking?
Dovahkiin! Use Dragonrend, if you know it!
Drem. Patience. I am answering, in my way.
Eltrys, yes, just last season we were wed.
Enough talk. Let's go kill some Imperials.
Everyone, on me! The Jarl wishes to speak!
Farewell, Enthir... words can't express...
Father, do you want to talk? About mother?
Feel free to take a look around the store.
Find out why he's here, and what he wants.
Fine. I won't ask questions. Cut me loose.
Free me, and I will carry you to Skuldafn.
Get in good with them and you'll find her.
Get some Spiced Wine. A Festival Favorite.
Give my regards to Karliah if you see her.
Good hunting. Go kill some bandits for me.
Good job out there. Glad you were with us.
Good work! Lucky we had you with us today.
Good. Here, take the key to the warehouse.
Good. I have your invitation to the party.
Haelga, we need to stop seeing each other.
Have you decided to pay the visitor's tax?
He didn't say, but you'd better move fast.
He's been gone for a long while. Too long.
Hello, my friend. Come to visit the forge?
Hello? Hello? Ah, I know you're listening.
Here, take this - it's called Jarrin Root.
Here. Some of my best armor. Wear it well.
Hey, don't you want to make this exchange?
Hmph. Everyone seems so insignificant now.
How dare you bring that Dunmer bitch here.
How goes the trade in and out of the city?
I am Sahloknir! Hear my Voice and despair!
I can't believe I've finally made it here.
I can't believe it. You have them already?
I can't believe we're finally getting out.
I can't thank you enough for what you did.
I did that engraved piece just last month!
I didn't think you had the stomach for it.
I don't even know what to think anymore...
I don't know if that's such a good idea...
I don't think that's how the Circle works.
I don't want that coming back to haunt me.
I eat Legionnaires like you for breakfast!
I find these parties such a dreadful bore.
I found this. I thought you might like it.
I guess that comes down to footwork, then.
I haven't known you to drink before, Ataf.
I joined up with them maybe ten years ago.
I know now that I can't live among people.
I need but a moment of your time, my lord.
I need twenty of them for my current crop.
I promise to live up to your expectations.
I protect the Jarl, whoever that might be.
I really thought you'd be able to save me.
I see I still have much to learn. Lead on.
I think I've got some mugs need scrubbin'.
I wish to speak to Karliah for the moment.
I wonder what Irileth is so excited about?
I... I think I need to stop talking now...
I'll throw some money at you. Good enough?
I'm a Blade, now. I can hardly believe it.
I'm a woman of refined, yet simple tastes.
I'm afraid we're well beyond pleasantries.
I'm feeling much better now thanks to you.
I'm going to eat well tonight, my darling!
I'm just a servant. Don't pay me any mind.
I'm not sticking around to fight a dragon!
I'm one of the last members of the Blades.
I'm proud to call a woman like you friend.
If that's what it will take then so be it.
If you change your mind, seek me out here.
If you need any jewelry, just let me know.
If you'll excuse me, I have a city to run.
Infos conditioned on Attack Delta go here.
It makes me sad whenever I think about it.
It pleases me to see you again, my patron.
It's almost getting downright hot out now.
It's been better, I'll be honest with you.
It's Joric. I fear his condition is worse.
It's just us against a dragon, is that it?
It's no use! Use the Scroll, Felldir! Now!
It's very important you do this correctly.
Keep the cold at bay with our spiced wine!
Killing dragons isn't defending the Reach?
Leaving? Take the world by storm, dearest.
Let me think... what were they working on?
Let's both get on with our lives now, hmm?
Let's see his eminence try to ignore this.
Look at that. Am I drunk? I must be drunk.
Look sharp. There they are. In the window!
Look, did you want the information or not?
Louder than the roar of the Mane, that is!
Luggage! Now where did I leave my luggage?
Madanach. I've brought what you asked for.
Many fine things are here for you, friend.
Mark my words, I'll be Jarl again someday!
May the blessings of the Nine be with you.
May your will carve itself upon the world.
Maybe you've already met Camilla Valerius?
Mind what - or who - you practice this on.
My boys'll keep you safe. Don't you worry.
My father doesn't know anything about me. 
My pa always warned me about these things!
Narri, do you think the war will ever end?
No one should ever be left to the Thalmor.
No, and before you ask, it's not for sale.
Not here. We will meet at Reachcliff Cave.
Not many come to see me. What do you want?
Not now, Braith. Go... go ask your father.
Nothing but foul deeds behind those walls.
Now ends this tale, my eternity be damned!
Now let's not talk about it anymore, okay?
Now thanks to you I needn't worry anymore.
Now what did you want? I already paid you.
Now, stand aside, there's work to be done.
Oh no! They've found me? I need your help!
Oh yes. You're a fine fat one, aren't you!
Oh, I'm sorry to keep you. Head right in. 
Oh, it's you. Come to extort more from me?
Oh, of course. Mother needs me, after all.
Oh, we have unfinished business you and I.
Once we get inside, all will become clear.
Ooh. What a fun trick. Teach me, teach me!
Oooh. Ahhh... Well... See, the thing is...
Out with it. What happened at the meadery?
Outlanders should mind their own business.
Picking through garbage. Has she no shame?
Please move quickly. Eldergleam awaits us.
Please, come back and speak to me anytime.
Please, come home. Just... Just come home.
Please, make it brief. We have much to do.
Please, no more. I'll pay, I'll pay. Here!
Please, there isn't much time. What is it?
Purpose? I should think it's self-evident.
Really? I dunno... I don't feel invisible.
Return anytime. You're quite welcome here.
Rise from your graves to defeat this worm!
See what a warrior of true mettle is like.
She's dead! On my watch! This won't stand!
Shor's bones! A handsome man in Falkreath.
Should have figured Astrid would send you.
Shouldn't the ceremony be completed first?
So am I. I hope she's happy at the temple.
So tell me, did Aringoth enjoy your visit?
So that's my sad story. What do you think?
So what's the news on the street, Captain?
So, Talen. Have you reconsidered my offer?
Someday I'm gonna grow up and be the Jarl.
Someday, you can have your own stronghold.
Someone get the battlemages out here. Now!
Someone has killed Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Somethin' ya need? Anything for the guild.
Sorry, Tythis. I'll get it to you somehow.
Spare a coin for a poor old woman, milady?
Spare a coin for a poor old woman, milord?
Spiced wine, the taste of home and hearth!
Stay back or I'll be forced to attack you!
Step into the light, and your test begins.
Take care, stranger. Be careful out there.
Take that crown back to Solitude, soldier.
Thank you for releasing us from her spell.
Thanks! Not sure it was necessary, though.
That bastard got exactly what he deserved.
That's a sensible lad. Now fetch me drink.
That's done it! Look, it's coming to life!
That's the Greybeards' business, not ours.
The enemy is mustering for a final attack.
The pilgrimage is complete, I can feel it.
The sooner I get out of Skyrim the better.
The war keeps most folks away, these days.
Then by all means, go about your business.
There is a Thieves Guild in town you know.
There is no point in further talk. Go now!
There's no need to hide. I won't hurt you.
There's no way out. There's no way out....
They're fighting over that thing, I think.
Things seem to be going well at the Guild.
This is enough to make your head spin, eh?
This... This is really from her, isn't it?
To Oblivion with your loot! This ends now!
Tonilia, can I offer some friendly advice?
True, he didn't stand a chance against me.
Tsk. What a man will do for a few coins...
Vegetables as crisp as a winter's morning!
Very funny. Did Enthir put you up to this?
Very good... Let's see what you have here.
Wait. Something's happening... gods above!
Watch yourself around here, it isn't safe.
We don't fight, son. We, um, talk. Loudly.
We just need the hilt and the pommel, now.
We'll be waiting to take her into custody.
We'll handle things from here. Move along.
We'll make it through, dear. We always do.
We're almost there. Windhelm's just ahead.
We're finally going to arrest the Butcher.
We're getting back to work as best we can.
Weak. He's weak. You're strong. Crush him.
Well then, your timing couldn't be better.
Well, there's an Imbuer in the Great Hall.
Well, this certainly won't help our image.
Well? Grelod the Kind. Is she... you know?
What further business do you have with us?
What I do, I do for Skyrim and her people.
What makes you so sure? What if I'm right?
What the... we've been betrayed! Look out!
What? Speak your meaning plainly, old man.
What's she doing poking her nose in there?
Where is papa? I want to ride Karinda now!
Where you off to? There's work to be done.
Who are they, daddy? Where are they going?
Why is this buried so far within Saarthal?
Why is this suddenly so important, anyway?
With good planning and constant vigilance.
Wonderful! Remarkably well-preserved, too.
Years of work, finally going to pay off...
Yes, Legate. No one is getting through us.
You forsake the weak and pitiful Boethiah?
You gonna stare all day or buy some armor?
You hear me you old fool! This isn't over!
You look sick. I hope it's not contagious.
You must be starving. Here, spend it well.
You ought to cover your... unmentionables.
You picked a bad time to get lost, friend.
You saved Whiterun today. We won't forget.
You sure that's power we're meant to have?
You sure? All right. I'll keep guard here.
You weren't ready. You still aren't ready.
You'll beg me to kill you before I'm done!
You're a cold hearted bastard, aren't you?
You're talking to a killer, remember that.
You've gathered quite a few of them I see.
You've got that fire under control. Right?
...dreaming... Defilers! Kill the defilers!
[no text -- heavy breathing due to fatigue]
A citizen of Hjaalmarch has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Skyrim has asked for our help.
A citizen of Winterhold has been kidnapped.
A group of them has holed up in Hjaalmarch.
A group of them has holed up in Winterhold.
A healing spell? Was that really necessary?
Alright, let's move, men! We've got more...
And if not, may she drown in her own tears.
And Meieran thinks that we should go there.
And... here. I suppose you've earned these.
Another Dark Elf. Just what Windhelm needs.
Anyway, here is your reward.  Thanks again.
Awww. And here I thought you could do it...
Bassianus is still so terrified of Jofthor.
Because I was clumsy enough to be captured.
Best not to walk the roads of Skyrim alone.
Best offense is a good defense, am I right?
Blood and silver, friend. Blood and silver.
Bring me another seven of them, if you can.
Bring your coins, but do not bring trouble.
Brother, I think she's telling the truth...
Brynjolf will provide you with the details.
But Housecarl... how can we fight a dragon?
But which among you truly exceeds the rest?
By the gods, stop toying with me and do it!
Can I help with it? Maybe just the cuirass?
Candy! Get your King Olaf's Festival candy!
Care to have a drink with me, sweet Sigrid?
Climb down that ledge and see if you can...
Come in, come in! Shut the door behind you!
Come on, get up... I need you on your feet.
Come, Rikke. There's still much to be done.
Damn it, woman, are you trying to taunt us?
Did I ask you to? Did you hear me say that?
Did she really run off and do this? For me?
Did you have any luck talking to my father?
Did you read that letter from Markarth yet?
Didn't I speak clear enough? Out of my way.
Do the men you killed haunt you? Mine do...
Do you think Tiber Septim ever fought here?
Doesn't matter. We'll kill them either way.
Don't be long. I can't wait around forever.
Don't forget to polish those glasses later.
Don't have any that are for sale right now.
Don't have nothing to say to you, stranger.
Don't mess anything up while you're here...
Don't talk to me. You could be one of them.
Don't trust that one. He's up to something.
Don't worry, I'll make it worth your while.
Don't you... Don't you say that name to me.
Dovahkiin zol mul. Zu'u gahvon miri Alduin.
Dragonborn, do whatever you're going to do!
Dragonborn, even in death you dog my steps?
Drink for the thirsty, food for the hungry.
Drive that snowback to the ground. Come on!
Easy there. I didn't mean nothing. Take it.
Excellent. They should be ready for us now.
Favor the bow, eh? I'm a sword man, myself.
Fight well, or die well. Talos be with you!
Finally, my leadership is being recognized.
First, I'll need to grab hold of your soul.
Gah! Quit throwing your garbage everywhere.
Get in good with Brynjolf, then we'll talk.
Get your festival meat pie. Specially made.
Gleda! And not a scratch on her! Happy day!
Good job. Now here's your part of the deal.
Good work. Here, take this, and keep quiet.
Good. Did she say anything we need to know?
Ha. Sure you did. Dagur put you up to this?
Have it your way. Let's get that crown men!
Have the decency to leave me to my sorrows.
He was rather straight forward with Torygg.
He was supposed to keep them under control.
He's toying with us. He wants us to follow.
Hello? You! Over here! Please, I need help!
Here, take your gold and leave me in peace.
Here's the name and location of the client.
Hey, what village are you from horse thief?
Hope you're not getting too wet back there.
How's the Corpselight treating you Mathies?
I better get back to sorting the dry goods.
I can certainly share a bit of what I know.
I can take you to any of the hold capitals.
I can't believe it! You're... Dragonborn...
I can't wait to learn from the priestesses.
I can't wait to see what the future brings.
I did. Those mead stains are always tricky.
I don't believe it. I guess you were right!
I don't know. Are you not listening at all?
I don't like it. What are they waiting for?
I hear there's baked slaughterfish tonight.
I hear you put Laelette out of her misery. 
I hope I'll see you in Solitude. Good luck.
I hope so. I can't stand this city anymore.
I just came to sing! This is a horror show!
I know I don't like the way he looks at me.
I propose a toast to Elenwen! Our mistress!
I see no harm in it, if you have the skill.
I still sense your presence, living fool...
I suppose it's time I gave him an answer...
I suppose it's time I give him an answer...
I want to see you when you're done working.
I watch you to make sure you are honorable.
I welcome you, friend. How may I serve you?
I'll be heading home, then, if you need me.
I'll claw the eyes out of whoever did this!
I'll let you explain that one to the Nords.
I'll show you to your room. Right this way.
I'll think on this, but I make no promises.
I'll work hard to justify your faith in me.
I'm busy right now, lad. We can talk later.
I'm eleven years old, and I could take you.
I'm Igmund's uncle as well as his steward. 
I'm ready when you are. Just give the word.
I'm sorry, were you about to say something?
I've hardly anything worth pickpocketing...
I've looked after her safety for so long...
I've never seen you before. Leave me alone!
I've never trusted him... what has he done?
If anything actually happens, call a guard.
If the river is not frozen to ice, perhaps.
Ignore the Orc. He pays, so I let him stay.
It'll be shuttered by the end of the month.
It's a Nordic ruin. Thousands of years old.
It's almost all I have time for these days.
It's been forever since I've eaten so well.
It's clear that memories are far too short.
It's good to spend some time on solid land.
It's no fun unless you fight me with magic.
J'zargo sees what you are up to. Very well.
Jarl Ulfric, what would you want in return?
Know that Gormlaith sent you down to death!
Lead, and I will follow, child of darkness.
Let me see if I can find the right panel...
Let's do this. Summon this dragon of yours.
Let's go on ahead. See if the way is clear.
Let's just get inside, see what's in there.
Let's see if we can find a way out of here.
Listen to me and you might learn something.
Look, a cave. A fine place to find trouble.
Looks like the way out's up ahead. Come on.
Looks like we're the only ones who made it.
Lure it into the trap! I'm counting on you!
May the blessings of the Eight be with you.
Maybe I will. What do you think about that?
Most impressive, mortal... most impressive.
My beacon is sure to attract a worthy soul.
Mzinchaleft. I swore I'd never return here.
No mother should have to bury her daughter.
No problem, I can carry a good bit of gear.
No, I don't need to mark it. I remember it.
No, nothing. At least nothing I'm aware of.
No! Not again! I shall not be denied again!
No.. get that accursed mace away from me...
Not if you were the last man in the Empire.
Not sure. Feeling like taking another trip.
Not yet, anyway, though it certainly could.
Nothing to say. Fine, but I'm watching you.
Nothing! I... it's ill fortune. That's all.
Now that's what I call a punch. You got me.
Now that's what I like to hear. Off you go.
Now you just tell me if you need something.
Now, there's no need to do anything rash...
Of course, not as many pilgrims these days.
Of course! You don't remember getting here.
Of course. But why not let her go in first?
Of course. But why not let him go in first?
Oh goodness, someone's going to get killed.
Oh no. No, no, no. This can't be happening.
Oh, a customer. Sorry you had to hear that.
Oh, interesting. I'll read it this evening.
Okay, okay. No need to make rash decisions.
On the cosmological scale, it's all nearby.
Once again you have come seeking something.
Once she's with child, I will not harm her.
One of the fiercest battles I've ever seen.
One way or another, get me those documents.
Please, do you have a potion you can spare?
Please, our tribe suffers and we need help.
Please. Come in. Musn't talk in the Ratway.
Psst. Hey, I know who you are. Hail Sithis.
Quick, I can cut you loose inside the keep.
Ready to board the carriage to the embassy?
Roggvir... Why did it have to be like this?
Running a little light in the pockets, lad?
See? I knew Aren wouldn't leave me in here!
She came by so Alva could kiss her goodbye.
Shor's bones, where will these demands end?
Sibbi? He's in prison... you put him there.
So you are alive. I was starting to wonder.
So you were right. Go tell the Jarl. Hurry!
So, any luck finding my louse of a husband?
So, he wants to take my city, walls intact.
So, what book should I read to you tonight?
So, you need a guide out of town after all?
Some fresh meat to fill your belly perhaps?
Sorry. You already have an animal with you.
Stand aside.  I don't need to speak to you.
Stop by again, sometime. I'll sing for you.
Sure has been quiet around the shop lately.
Take out Haldyn, and we'll handle the rest.
Take pity, sir, and spare me a few septims.
Thank you. I'll be waiting for that bottle.
Thanks, I was actually worried I'd run out.
That's a load off my mind. Here's your pay.
That's it! You've got one of them lined up!
That's just what Ulfric wants you to think.
That's not funny, Bolli. People are scared.
That's some good armor you've put together.
The bride has been murdered! Somebody help!
The child is spirited, but lacks... agency.
The general expects so much with so little.
The name of the person you want is Karliah.
The old man trusted you, so I'll trust you.
The others'll have to find another way out.
Then let it be done. Farewell, my brothers!
There is murder in the air. I can taste it.
There will be. Of that, you can be assured.
There's more of them somewhere around here.
These are the terms currently on the table.
Think the guards will be coming down, soon?
This is the last time I'll say it. Get out.
Thorald can't be left to those... monsters.
Those binds aren't going to cut themselves.
Too lazy to give him a drink yourself? Oaf.
Touchy. Maybe some Dunmer lives in you yet.
Truly, one of our great fires has gone out.
Try not to set anything on fire, all right?
Uh, yes sir. That's me. The oafish servant.
Ulfric... what have you done my old friend?
Unlock that door and let's get out of here.
Wait a second, there's another option here.
Wait, let me guess. You'll get to it later.
Waste of talent throwing me in here, right?
We even have a celebration planned for you.
We're all behind you, friend. Do your best.
We're getting Thorald back, no matter what.
We're going to slaughter them. All of them.
We're playing Hunt the Elf. You're the Elf.
We're ready, Dragonborn. Just say the word.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Riften.
Well then, you won't be leaving here alive!
Well, err, yes. Sorry to have troubled you.
Well, if it isn't my little problem-solver.
Well, my friend, you did not know Ysgramor.
Well, now. That's something to think about.
Well, on to the business at hand then, hmm?
Well? Get out of here and mind your rounds.
Welp, time to gather more supplies I guess.
What about my father? Was he a good hunter?
What did I tell you? Keep quiet about that.
What happened after was my fault. All mine.
What in the name of the gods are you doing?
What? After all this, I can't even see him?
What? Why are you skulking about like that?
Whatever, just get it done. Here's the job.
When you find your nerves, then we'll talk.
Who did you have to kill to get that blade?
Why do you delay? Are you Dovahkiin or not?
Will you be needing anything special today?
Would you raise your shield in her defense?
Would you raise your shield in his defense?
Yeah, it's really something else, isn't it?
Yeah... Let's wait a little longer. Then...
Yes, Listener. I'll be here if you need me.
Yes, madam. I know I have a lot to work on.
You a fighting man? How about a little bet?
You ain't made me that stew in a long time.
You are like my brood to me. Here. A token.
You can't kill what's already dead, mortal.
You could have asked before just taking it.
You don't want to be here. No one wants to.
You have no business here, so keep walking.
You know who I am, fool. So why you askin'?
You reek of death, my friend. I salute you.
You should try the venison. It's delicious.
You speak to Burguk, chief of Dushnikh Yal.
You think to betray Mehrunes Dagon? Suffer!
You're closing the stall, and that's final.
You're looking at the best miner in Skyrim.
You're not a thief trying to rob me, right?
You're not a threat... merely an annoyance.
You're playing a dangerous game, my friend.
You're right, dear. I'm sorry to worry you.
You've already learned all I can teach you.
You've done well by restoring our Festival.
Your family's success burdens you, does it?
A little push and this would all be simpler.
A little snow never stopped me, don't worry.
A wise and foresighted policy, in the event.
A... giant's toe? You're... sure about that?
Actually, yes Arch-Mage. I believe there is.
Ah, but I can do that right here. Right now!
Ah, I see. Very well, my friend. I'll do it.
Ahhhhgh. Wearing flesh is so... distasteful.
All I had hoped was to capture Mercer alive.
All right, then. Let's put that to the test.
Alvor can help you out. He's our blacksmith.
Always, child. Mara's mercy is ever-flowing.
Amaund Motierre? I have no idea who that is.
And where can we find this nameless old man?
And would you raise your sword in her honor?
And would you raise your sword in his honor?
Are you prepared to receive my golden words?
Are you serious? You're as crazy as Maramal.
Are you... Are you sure? The staff is there?
Aye! We haven't forgotten Markarth, Tullius!
Bah! You're just as bad as the rest of them.
Be careful. They're faster than you'd think.
Because war is good for business, of course.
Been too long since I've embraced my rage...
Big swords should always beat little swords.
Bless you, friend. You have renewed my hope.
Blessings to you. The Divines are listening.
Bolar has been in a bad mood for weeks, now.
Brother! Mara's mercy, it's good to see you!
But first, you must restore to me my beacon.
But I at least will negotiate in good faith.
But I'll follow the old man's lead. As ever.
But mother says you're a terrible innkeeper!
By order of the Jarl, I command you to halt!
Can we at least go to the tavern for supper?
Can't wait to kill another of Ulfric's boys.
Clever try, scab, but it won't be that easy!
Come on Galmar. We have a lot of work to do.
Come on, I want a better look at that thing.
Come on, we just need a little elbow grease.
Come slumming to the Gray Quarter, have you?
Come, my men stand ready on the great porch.
Could have been my imagination, I suppose...
Could sure use a warm bed right about now...
Cure? Hah. You're sounding like the old man.
Did you think the Blades had been destroyed?
Didn't think you had the coin for it anyway.
Do you ever want to go to Morrowind, Sondas?
Do you have some reason to be here, citizen?
Do you need alchemy components? Or training?
Don't be like them. Don't feel sorry for me.
Don't bother me again unless it's important.
Don't break anything with that weapon, okay?
Don't give them a chance to warn the others!
Don't worry about me. I know how to lay low.
Don't worry, Arkay's protection is absolute.
Don't worry. We'll get out of here, somehow.
Dunno. One of these corpses. Does it matter?
Fall back, fall back! Regroup and fall back!
Father, how old were you when you left home?
Father, why do you and mother fight so much?
Finally, someone with backbone. Here you go.
Fine. I'll send the Unblooded here with you.
Fine. Please accept this token of gratitude.
First, an incantation to remove the barrier.
Get it into the trap before it kills us all!
Give it up, Brynjolf... those days are over.
Go to Solitude. Stalk the Jarl and slay her.
Gods. A woman attacked right on the streets.
Gone. The living are right to fear the dead.
Good, good. It'll be worth it, I assure you.
Good. I'm spread thin. I could use the help.
Great shot. Now hit the target to the right.
Guard! My fine's been paid, now set me free!
Ha! I didn't think he'd really give it back.
Ha! You showed those spiders a thing or two!
Has the Bloodmoon called you, fellow Hunter?
Has the Warmth of Mara been given to Riften?
Have I done something to make you bother me?
Have you been working on your concentration?
He tends the store, and I've got this stall.
Here. For you. Don't thank me, just take it.
Here. Take this. For your time and all that.
Here. You deserve a reward for your service.
Here's the letter. Now leave me out of this.
Here's your payment. Well earned, as always.
Hey, I still have plenty of work to do here.
Hey! What did you do to me? My body is gone!
Hircine will bless us for finding his Totem.
Hmph. Help them drink up our mead, you mean.
Hold up. There's a bear just ahead. See her?
How about I trade you a song for some fruit?
How do you feel? I think you might be sick. 
How do you stay cheery down in these blazes?
How do you think the crops are coming, dear?
I ain't askin' for much, just a few septims.
I ain't going to lie, it's still pretty bad.
I am prepared to deal with your insolence...
I am Sanguine, Daedric Prince of Debauchery!
I assure you, I'm prepared to make any deal.
I can't afford to just give my jewelry away!
I can't believe we actually killed a dragon!
I can't hold these things! We need to leave!
I claim the glory of your defeat, Dovahkiin!
I don't expect you to know what that means. 
I don't think this day is ever going to end.
I guess I can look the other way, this time.
I had another run-in with the Thieves Guild.
I have things I should see to, but go ahead.
I haven't heard a true shout in generations!
I need you to create some chaos in the hold.
I swear, I left another bottle right here...
I think you'd be a little smarter than that.
I thought it high time I caught up with you.
I thought you played wonderfully last night.
I will have his head for this, I assure you.
I wonder who will replace him in the Circle?
I work in the mine, just like everyone else.
I wouldn't take that to heart. It's her way.
I... I submit. What is your bidding, master.
I... well. Perhaps. But still! It's curious.
I'd like to know as much as we can about it.
I'd like to, but it's not as simple as that.
I'd sell her for that, but you ain't got it.
I'll be honest, I wouldn't have expected it.
I'll find you... it's only a matter of time.
I'm busy right now, lass. We can talk later.
I'm hoping this wife can outlast the winter.
I'm not quite ready to let go of my husband.
I'm proud of you for helping provide for us.
I'm sorry, I don't. Come see me again later.
I'm sorry, I've come too far to lose it now.
I've already given you a job, now get to it.
I've waited long for such a worthy opponent.
If you can stop them, you'll be a true hero!
If you insist. Come on boys. This'll be fun.
If you need a meal or a room, I've got both.
If you were anyone else, I'd make you leave.
If you wish to talk, I'll be here for a bit.
It should be embarrassed to be uncovered so.
It's like the ancient legends. Dragonborn...
It's starting to look like Esbern was right.
It's the End Times! The End Times have come!
Just get out of my way, I've got work to do.
Just guide them well, and all will work out.
Keep looking. Someone's here, I can feel it.
Kolskeggr, overrun with Forsworn, what next?
La la la, do do do do do, dum de dum dum... 
Last warning. Stand back from the execution.
Let's just hope they got it right this time.
Looking for the blade? You aren't the first!
Looks like we've got ourselves another fool.
Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious.
M'aiq is tired now. Go bother somebody else.
Make it up? That doesn't seem appropriate...
Malur, I need you to take care of something.
May you return to Her Benevolence in safety.
Maybe you just aren't up to the challenge...
Meyz mul, Dovahkiin. You have become strong.
My husband and I were just recently married.
No more nightmares. Thank the gods for that.
No, and I never will. Now get out of my inn!
No, I haven't. Don't tell me you've lost it.
Not now, lad. Karliah said it was important.
Not sure you should be walking around naked.
Now you're going to be sorry you crossed me.
Now, let's just pretend this never happened.
Of course, sweetie. What'd you like to know?
Of course. Your training isn't complete yet.
Oh no! By the gods! This can't be happening!
Oh wait, let me guess - you don't have them.
Oh, do come in! I hope I have what you need.
Once more and I'm going to have to kill you.
Perhaps, but it just means more work for me.
Please, whatever you did, just make it stop!
Please! I'm not sure I'll make it on my own.
Ra'jirr was always dragging her into things.
Reckon you can. How much you willing to pay?
Remember, fireballs. You can never go wrong.
Riff-raff! That's all you Riften people are!
Right. Okay, tell me if you change yer mind.
Running a little light in the pockets, lass?
Seems like a noble cause, I'll look it over.
She wanted to play with me forever and ever.
She's probably the one you ought to talk to.
Should we consider investigating the matter?
Shout at us, and let us taste of your Voice.
Show the rebels the futility of their cause.
So I need someone to find that proof for me.
So I'll ask again, Gray-Mane or Battle-Born?
So we're looking for a Shout, then. Damn it.
So what's your story? Just here to... relax?
So you don't know anything about this house?
So you have, mortal. Go now. Kill Orchendor.
So, the ending of my tale I began earlier...
So, what do we have here? Hmm. Let me guess.
So. You're an Imperial spy... Interesting...
Some are too happy to fight. Blood runs hot.
Soon, I will be of age. The taste is bitter.
Sorry, a girl can't be too careful out here.
Speak with Miss Salma, if you wish to speak.
Steward Hemming Black-Briar at your service.
Stick close. This place gives me the creeps.
Still you persist? Very well, you may enter.
Sure, Sorex. Just like you did the last one.
Take down that one with your bare hands too?
Take it easy, father. You're making a scene.
Take my beacon to the mount above Kilkreath.
Take pity, lady, and spare me a few septims.
Tell him what you told me. About the dragon.
Thank you again for resolving my... problem.
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
Thank you! You'll find the ruins right here.
Thanks again for delivering that ore sample.
Thanks! I'm going to go put it on right now.
Thanks. Couldn't have done that without you.
That is the Necromancer's Amulet, of legend.
That she did. Very good. I'll tell Brynjolf.
That's it! Now, wait until he's well inside!
That's why I'm here with my Shield-Brothers.
The College survived, and so here we remain.
The Jarl of the Pale has asked for our help.
The Jarl of the Rift has asked for our help.
The Jarl of Whiterun has asked for our help.
The men are already gathering at the gates. 
The misses and I love your strawberry tarts.
The old Nords sure did love their stonework.
The time for talk has passed. We must hurry.
Then I guess that's your last request, fool!
Then let me speed your passage to Sovngarde!
Then we're speakin' the same language. Good.
There is no trust for Khajiit in this place.
There you are. I've been trying to find you.
There's a dead one, isn't there. Thought so.
There's nothing left of Winterhold. Nothing!
There's nothing quite like a good vegetable.
There's nothing wrong with what we're doing.
There's one way to find out. Try to Shout...
They'll have set barricades to slow us down.
Think very carefully about your next move...
Think we should buy more horses next season?
This is going to be terrible for business...
This is not the time to keep Astrid waiting.
This is part of me. Guard it with your life.
This is where it will begin. A new uprising.
This rain will stop eventually. Always does.
This stronghold is for the Orcs. Leave. Now.
Trinkets, odds and ends, that sort of thing.
Try not to disappoint. Or to get her killed.
Try not to disappoint. Or to get him killed.
Tsk. What a woman will do for a few coins...
Umm.... No, my Jarl. I'm afraid there isn't.
Usual guild rate. Let's take a look at them.
Vald? Why would you want to help that idiot?
Very good. Let's continue with our practice.
Very well, Ulfric. Enjoy your petty victory.
Vilkas will see if you're worth our trouble.
Wait, so... a costume? You're not serious...
Wait. There's something different about you.
We can talk after the Guild Master ceremony.
We have plenty of ingredients for sale, too.
We haven't forgotten your crimes, outlander.
We shall see soon enough. Alduin approaches!
We're here for Alduin's Wall, right, Esbern?
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Morthal.
Welcome to the Legion, auxiliary. Listen up.
Welcome to Whiterun, friend. Go right on in.
Well fought, friend. Your fury is unmatched.
Well if it turns up, I'll be willing to buy.
Well that's not how I operate, so forget it.
Well why do I have to listen to Skjor, then?
Well, I'll try to be a good influence, then.
Well, then you won't be leaving here at all.
Well, well. And you seem to be in one piece!
Well... I'll let you go about your business.
What do you know about my people, outlander?
What kind of fool plays with fire like that?
What? And you call yourself a son of Skyrim?
What? Something you're still confused about?
What? Who are you? How did you get this far?
What's going on? Why would somebody do that?
What's that? Oh yes, yes. Thank you, I will.
What's this about Riverwood being in danger?
Why do you intrude here, if not for tinvaak?
Why don't you have a chat with Legate Rikke?
Wizards. There oughta be a law against them.
Wonderful! Here is the key to your new home.
Yes, Listener? How can Cicero be of service?
Yes, of course. The Arch-Mage has my thanks.
You a fighting girl? How about a little bet?
You already appear to have someone with you.
You aren't making any sense. Hand what over?
You better. I hate people who waste my time.
You did? Maybe that's why I'm so sleepy now.
You do indeed have the power. I'm impressed.
You have strong arms. You'd make a good Orc.
You just made the last mistake of your life!
You know about Talos? He founded the Empire!
You learn quickly, as only a Dragonborn can.
You must be talking about the caravan job...
You need to take better care of your sister.
You promised me you'd sweep the entranceway.
You should have acted. They're already here.
You tried mercenary work? It might suit you.
You wear that Stormcloak armor well, friend.
You were given Namira's ring? A great honor.
You're a monster. Leave and never come back!
You're back. Good. You'll want to hear this.
You're just in time to say hello to Roggvir.
You're not listening to me. I don't have it.
You're not really allowed in here, you know.
...retire some day... get myself an island...
A citizen of the Pale has asked for our help.
A citizen of the Rift has asked for our help.
A citizen of Whiterun has asked for our help.
A dragon is attacking the Western Watchtower.
A dwarven city. A place of mystery and death.
A Dwemer city. The lost people. The heretics.
Afraid I'll cause another scene, I suppose...
Ah, the blood of deceit is a nourishing flow.
Ah, yes. There was an incident, wasn't there?
Ah, you've got the axe! And my dog. Splendid.
Ah! Damn wizard. Keep your spells off of me. 
Ah... so tender. Come here, you juicy morsel!
Ain't every day we get visitors in Riverwood.
Always a pleasure to meet a prospective bard.
And how is that old warrior doing these days?
And indeed, there are many that call me hero.
And most of us are quite satisfied with that.
And Torygg wasn't ready to let it fall apart.
Are you all right? Did you see what happened?
Arms and armor! Forged by a master craftsman!
Aye. Whatever you want to do, we're with you.
Bah, it's no use. Let's get back to it, then.
Be about your business, while I'm about mine.
Be more careful next time. This isn't a game.
But it is all of you who are the true heroes!
But who knows? I've been proven wrong before.
By the Eight, I didn't think you could do it!
Came all the way out here to see us, did you?
Can you close up the stand early today, mama?
Come back if you need a new ring or necklace.
Come on! We've got to find a way out of here!
Come up to the Skyforge to pay your respects.
Curse you for bringing up that bitter memory.
Damn it, there's got to be a way out of here!
Damn it. Why'd you have to walk into Morthal?
Damn you mages! Aren't you good for anything?
Didn't think I'd be seeing you again so soon.
Do you have the fragments of Wuuthrad, still?
Do you not know the Daedric Lord of the Hunt?
Do you think we'll find gold nuggets in here?
Do your loyalties lie with the Thalmor, then?
Don't be shy. You should be the one to carve.
Don't think I'm being paid already? Get lost.
Ebony armor. By Ysmir, 'tis a wondrous sight.
Empty your pockets or end up as skeever food.
End of the road. Markarth, right on schedule.
Err, excuse me Enthir. Might I have a moment?
Exactly, Bulfrek. You always know your place.
Find Savos, and get him back here if you can!
For once you'll actually pay for your crimes.
Fortune and glory, friend. Fortune and glory.
Fresh-baked loaves, still warm from the oven!
Get out of here.... I'm in no mood to talk...
Gods, I'll be glad to see the last of Skyrim.
Have a seat, there should be plenty of space.
Have you scried anything new in the entrails?
He just wants you to follow in his footsteps.
He would ask that it please not happen again.
He's as pig-headed a man as you'll ever find.
Heard there were wolves on the road up north.
Here you go, sir. The finest Colovian brandy.
Here. For you. For my hatchling of the heart.
His power crumbles - do not pause for breath!
Hmmm, well don't take what you don't have to.
How quickly you've advanced. Most impressive.
Huh. Not sure. I don't worship Talos, myself.
Hurry, Nazir! I'm telling you, he's in there!
I ain't begging. I just need a job. Anything.
I am buying a fish for Noster. He likes fish.
I bet my uncle Ralof is tougher than you are.
I can see that disapproving look in your eye.
I could do this all day. Here's your payment.
I daresay you've learned all I can teach you.
I do hope it's true. So many opportunities...
I do not know - but none have passed through.
I don't know what your aunts told you, but...
I don't like being out in the open like this.
I don't like you... I think you're a heretic.
I gave up this kind of thing a long time ago.
I guess I can spare him a few beatings. Deal.
I have a feeling there's going to be trouble.
I have my ways, but it's not easy these days.
I have something I want to give to you. Here.
I have spent my entire life searching for it.
I hope to get into the Bards College one day.
I hope we keep you. This can be a rough life.
I hope whatever you're going to do will work.
I hope you brought a little something for me.
I just wanted to know if you needed anything.
I need to lay down. I'll just be a minute....
I promise to join you there as soon as I can.
I provide my wisdom and insight to the court.
I said get out! I'm not paying a single coin!
I said my fine has been paid! Now let me out!
I suppose Kjeld asked for the usual discount?
I tell you, I tell you, the Dragonborn comes.
I thank you and the college thanks you, Jarl.
I think I've said enough. Now leave me alone.
I think it may have to be far away from here.
I think she's sitting by the fire. Poor girl.
I think you'd better go see Mirabelle Ervine.
I thought you didn't believe I was in danger!
I won't forget what you've done for Solitude.
I wonder if perhaps you could assist with it.
I wonder what great battles were fought here?
I'll also notify my guards of your new title.
I'll be at the docks if you change your mind.
I'll be right here if you need anything else.
I'll cut out your eyes and sell 'em for coin!
I'll get everything ready and meet you there.
I'll mark it on your map. This one's on you. 
I'll need to prepare them for mounting again.
I'll... I'll go speak to Fastred. Post-haste!
I'm afraid not. I don't deal in stolen goods.
I'm sorry. What would you like to talk about?
I'm sure it will be fine. Just don't be late.
I'm sure my mother can compensate you for it.
I've a mine to run, so if you'll excuse me...
I've toured our camps. We're ready, Ulfric...
If there's nothing else, I have work to do...
If you could spare a septim, I'd be grateful.
If you drink too much, you're out. No drunks.
If you go in there, you don't come out. Ever.
If you see Karliah, don't hesitate. Kill her.
If you wish to trade, see me during daylight.
In any event, nice work. Here's your payment.
Is everything well with you, my scaly friend?
It only hurts when I laugh. He he he. Owww...
It worked! I knew you'd come, I just knew it!
It's a little late for that, don't you think?
It's fine... I had to tell someone I suppose.
It's for Marise, but don't say a word to her!
It's just across the bridge and up that hill.
It's nice to be back in a friendly spot, huh?
Just give me a minute... I'm out of breath...
Just shut it and keep an eye out for trouble.
Keep it together, Gianna. Keep it together...
Keep them coming and keep them strong, Valga.
Kill them all. Protect the Jarl at all costs!
Killing you will make for an excellent story.
Know about them? Lad, you're looking at them.
Laborers. The sick. The lame. We're all here.
Leave me alone... I'm in no mood for talking.
Legate, with me. We have a lot of work to do.
Let me know as soon as you've found anything.
Let's get to the stables before they find me.
Let's go, let's go! Before anyone notices us.
Listener. It is an honor to stand before you.
Look around. Grab anything that looks useful.
Make a move toward Balgruuf, and you're dead.
Make sure to get yourself something to drink.
Make sure to recommend us to your associates.
Malacath has heard my pleas! He speaks to us!
Mama, when can we go play in the river again?
Masterful. That's a work of art, right there.
May all your adventures be worthy of telling.
May the gods watch over your battles, friend.
Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.
Maybe you want to rethink what you're asking?
Members of the College -- your new Arch-Mage!
Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok.
Most people head over to the Winking Skeever.
Move it soldier. Spread the word. Go. Go. Go.
Mul is the smart one. I go where he tells me.
My friend! A toast to a beautiful friendship!
My men? What did you do? You'll die for this.
My mother and father yell a lot. Always have.
Need some gold? I may have some work for you.
Need something? Talk to my brother, Elrindir.
Next season, nephew. Next season for sure....
Nice. Here, this is what you'll need to know.
No problem, I'll get someone else to take it.
No, Gorm. I am simply telling you what I see.
No. And they're afraid of you, of your power.
Not here. I told you to meet me in Riverwood.
Not long. They're hiding in the country side.
Not now, lass. Karliah said it was important.
Not sure how much longer I can hold out here.
Now what's this so-called proof you speak of?
Now where did I put that shipment of forks...
Now, is lavender an herb or a poison? Hmm....
Of course you were. Now stop wasting my time.
Of course, they'd probably already be dead...
Oh Listener. Can't you see that's impossible?
Oh yeah? I think so too. You're pretty smart.
Oh yes, Cicero and the Listener! On the hunt!
Oh yes, mistress. Perfectly! You're the boss.
Oh, fine. Keep your secrets. I see how it is.
Oh, thank you! Divines bless your kind heart.
Oh? I don't expect anyone to miss my meaning.
One of the prisoners, if I recall correctly. 
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart.
Papa, mama's making me do kitchen work again.
Perhaps one day, I'll write a song about you!
Please do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm.
Please feel welcome in the court of Solitude.
Please hurry, I have only a few bottles left!
Put that thing away before someone gets hurt!
Really? I mean... I still feel like I'm here.
Remember. I need that bandit dead. Not alive.
Remember. It was the Nords who locked you up.
Remove him. He's disturbing the other guests.
Ruins ahead. Means old traps and bonewalkers.
See me at my forge if you need arms or armor.
Seems your purse is lighter than you thought.
Seven. Astonishing. I hadn't considered that.
She said you stay in there, and that's final.
Shor's bones... how did they find this place?
Shouldn't leave things around to trip over...
Skjor's somewhere ahead. We need to find him.
So that's why you were in the cart. Thieving.
Sometimes I think your head is made of rocks.
Sometimes I'm surprised he's still the chief.
Sorry Lady Dinya, but I've been busy of late.
Stendarr's Mercy. You found it. Azura's Star.
Suddenly I feel like I can take on the world.
Take your time. I understand your hesitation.
Tell me, husband. Is it true what I've heard?
Terrible shame, what happened to those women.
Thank Malacath we got out of Kolskeggr alive.
Thank you, Jarl Elisif. But about the cave...
Thanks, sister. I knew we could count on you.
That answer your damn questions? Now get out.
That went pretty well, all things considered.
That's what happens when you cross the Guild.
The beds and beer are both lousy, you ask me.
The Dominion is here, and we're watching you.
The Eldergleam has blessed us with a sapling.
The house is so... empty, Enmon... and quiet.
The Imperials think we need their laws. Pfft.
The Jarl of Eastmarch has asked for our help.
The Jarl of Falkreath has asked for our help.
The Jarl of Haafingar has asked for our help.
The Jarl of the Reach has asked for our help.
The, um, Emperor thanks you... Now shove off!
Then the judgment of this Circle is complete.
There are dragons about, traveler. Be warned.
There's a place for trash, and that's not it.
There's no telling what we might find inside!
They are, but your mind has to be sharp, too.
This Dwemer lockbox. Look upon it and wonder.
This has nothing to do with you, so back off.
This one's locked. Let's see about that gate.
To Riften, my pet. How you'll adore the city.
Traditionally it's carried by the court mage.
Trust is hard to come by here, but all right.
Umm. You got no clothes. You should get some.
Unfortunate. Let's be more careful next time.
Until then, here. This is for you, in thanks.
Very well. Here, take this for your troubles.
We are all blood here. One family, one tribe.
We can talk after I find out what's going on.
We never should have brought that thing here!
We will keep each other safe. No matter what.
We'll have to carry this one on our backs....
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Dawnstar.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Markarth.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Solitude.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Whiterun.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Windhelm.
Welcome, traveler. Mind yourself in our town.
Well don't just stand there. Go get my flute!
Well fought, ya swinging bit of skeever bait.
Well, that's taken care of. No thanks to you.
Well... No. Not really. Not directly, I mean.
Werebears? Where? Bears? Men that are bears? 
What a delightful find! This should cover it.
What are you waiting for? Up the stairs! Now!
What do you see from that little cage? Speak.
What do you think? Some more Nirnroot, maybe?
What was it like killing your first one, huh?
What you're asking for is insane. Impossible!
What? Someone will suffer for this injustice.
What...? No... No, this can't be happening...
Where are my goods? Did the shipment come in?
Who knows what powers the elixir will unlock!
Who taught you to fight? Keep those hands up!
Why do the Nords bother you so much, Ambarys?
Why, this is astounding news! Wonderful news!
With Lisbet gone, I'll be taking care of you.
Yes, I'm afraid you're right. Such a shame...
Yes, my daughter, what is it I can help with?
Yes. Definitely early Akaviri stonework here.
Yet another child has prayed to their mother.
You can tell it because it has lots of ebony.
You can't scare me into submission. Let's go.
You dare bring me here? You must be punished.
You did? We heard that Ulfric was captured...
You know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor.
You might be able to trap him there, exactly.
You realize this is exactly what they wanted.
You should be more careful with those flames.
You should talk to Ainethach. He's in charge.
You should tell him to mind his own business.
You will die for the glory of the Dragonborn!
You. Every time I look at you my blood boils.
You're going to end up helping me. I know it.
You're referring to that blacksmith contract?
You're trailing me? I knew I heard something.
You've taken up enough of my time. Now leave.
A citizen of Eastmarch has asked for our help.
A citizen of Falkreath has asked for our help.
A citizen of Haafingar has asked for our help.
A citizen of the Reach has asked for our help.
A home for the two of us. I'll meet you there.
A war dog is good company and good protection.
Ah, yes. Of course. No, I don't need anything.
Ain't nothing for it. They're still in charge.
All eyes are on you, lad. Don't disappoint us.
All right, let's see if we can find a way out.
All right, that's enough. Back to bed, please.
All right. Back to slicing, dicing and baking.
Alvor and I, we got a daughter. Little Dorthe.
Always looking on the bright side, aren't you.
An investment? Very well, I don't see why not.
And come back with a barrel full of gold, hmm?
Are we close? Thalmor spies could be anywhere.
Are you completely insane? Swallow a soul gem?
Aren't the Greybeards expecting some supplies?
As forge-wife, I'm also in charge of our mine.
As usual. I've always got an eye on the rocks.
At the end of the day, every warrior is alone.
Be careful. This man is known to be dangerous.
Best get rid of the ones we see. Just in case.
Beware! The World-Eater waits within the mist!
Blackreach... why does that sound so familiar?
But he won't reveal how to open it. Maddening.
But I am cursed, it would seem, to live alone.
But if you are wise, you will heed my bidding.
But someone still has quite a bit to do. Hmmm?
But there isn't any other way through, Legate.
But, I've got the key to the Sabre Cage! Look!
But... But you're not going to kill me. Right?
By the Eight! You actually talked her into it?
Can you do it? Can you devour a dragon's soul?
Can you imagine the kind of power behind this?
Come back when you need more meat. Bring gold.
Come to me or Aela if you're looking for work.
Come, we must get to the Skull and destroy it.
Crawl back into whatever pit spawned you, Orc.
Damn thieves. As if things weren't bad enough.
Do not be afraid. Your Shout will not harm us.
Do the men you've killed haunt you? Mine do...
Do you miss your days training at the College?
Don't kid yourself... stone runs in our blood.
Don't make me tell you again. Get out of here.
Dovahkiin, you call yourself? Arrogant mortal.
Either that or go see the Jarl's court wizard.
Farewell. Eyes open and walk with the shadows.
Father says I shouldn't play with you anymore.
For Skyrim! For Shor! For Sovngarde's freedom!
For the glory of the Companions! For Ysgramor!
Fortune smiles on us. Here's your share, love.
From her reverie, we know the mind of our god.
General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!
Get these prisoners out of the carts. Move it!
Give the word, my lord, and Whiterun is yours.
Go ahead and fill her in with all the details.
Go ahead and fill him in with all the details.
Go right on in. The party has already started.
Good luck. And try not to get yourself killed.
Good. Make sure not one of them escapes alive.
Good. We'll be waiting for you at the stables.
Great, with the two of us this should be easy.
Hadvar! Into the keep, soldier, we're leaving!
Hammerfell? I'm not against the idea, but why?
Hang on. When the ceremony's done, we'll talk.
Has the Thieves Guild visited you yet, Haelga?
Hasn't Mercer Frey taught you people anything?
Have you seen Laelette? Have you seen my wife?
Have you taken care of that... little problem?
Healing spells always leave me light-headed...
Help! Can anyone hear me? I'm stuck down here.
Here, take this as a small token of my esteem.
Here's the noble Empire in all its glory. Pah.
Hey, how's it going. Need pickpocket training?
His father before him perhaps, but not Torygg.
His perception may be more coherent than ours.
Hm? Sorry, just thinking about my experiments.
Hold on. I want to hear what Irileth's saying.
Huh. Okay. We'll test your mettle another day.
humming softly to self- no subtitles displayed
Hurry, Nazir! I'm telling you, she's in there!
Hush, Frodnar. This is no time for your games.
I always leave room for the main course, Eola.
I cannot thank you enough for all of the help.
I don't expect you to be capable of even that.
I don't think that could have gone any better.
I get them fresh from the farms daily, Nazeem.
I got another harangue from Torsten yesterday.
I hate to admit it, but you're probably right.
I have to remember... ward first, then summon.
I have to work, or Anton will rip my head off.
I haven't lived this long to be beaten by you!
I heard you attacked someone in town recently.
I hope the Divines have been keeping you well.
I hope the tower holds out until we get there.
I hope the wilds claim you, one of these days.
I hope we will speak again soon, marsh-friend.
I hope your trip to Labyrinthian was worth it.
I presume you have something important to say?
I really can't thank you enough for your help.
I say you've earned an early pardon. Let's go.
I see. He did not survive. He... He died well?
I should remind Kleppr to clean this place up.
I want to get to my son. He's all I have left.
I wish more of our ranks asked such questions.
I wouldn't even clean my tail with this trash.
I... I'm sorry, Belchimac. I didn't mean that.
I'll talk to Alvor about getting us a new one.
I'm a cripple. I have a reason to be drinking.
I'm afraid I don't see the connection, though.
I'm been farming this bit of land all my life.
I'm busy, and you're bothering me. So go away.
I'm going with you whether you like it or not.
I'm just worried about what he's teaching her.
I'm not playing with you, Kayd! You play mean!
I'm sorry, Betrid. I'll clean them right away.
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep for a while now.
I've heard some rumors... about you and Skjor.
If anyone should be thanked, it should be you.
If it's a fight you want, I'm ready this time.
If my Asgeir is happy, then I'm happy. Really.
If you beat up my sister Sissel, I won't tell.
If you ever come back, I won't be so gracious.
If you find that sword, please bring it to me.
If you need another drink, I'll be right here.
If you'll excuse me, I'll return to my duties.
Is there anything else you'd like to purchase?
It seems warmer down here than it was outside.
It stands ready to meet the blood of her foes.
It stands ready to meet the blood of his foes.
It was supposed to be an honor, but very well.
It's abandoned and it's always been abandoned.
It's all we've got for today. Don't be greedy.
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes.
It's been two months, and no word from father.
It's frightening living below their monastery.
It's good to be away from the forge for a bit.
It's just that we've run out of the Alto wine.
It's yours now. I won't take it back. I won't.
J'zargo finds nothing but dust in these ruins.
J'zargo only has so much room to carry things.
Jewelry with legendary Argonian craftsmanship!
Just send me a copy when you've deciphered it.
Keep it together! There's not many of us left!
Know about them? Lass, you're looking at them.
Lady Mara bids you welcome to Her Benevolence.
Let me guess - someone stole your sweetroll...
Let me know if there's anything else you need.
Let me know if you come down with the Rattles.
Let's get down there. We have to do something.
Let's get going. I want her head on my mantle.
Make your excuses from the Bloodworks, wizard.
Malacath is pleased with your strength, Larak.
May the light of certitude guide your efforts.
May your next fight bring you victory, friend.
May your weapons be sharp and your prey fresh.
Men who, I might add, we're precious short on.
Mercer's been here, I hope we aren't too late.
Move on, friend. I have nothing to sell today.
Much appreciated, Lady Drifa, but I'll manage.
Murdered? By Azura, who would do such a thing?
My axe is yours, outlander. Just say the word.
My ears are always open to a friend's request.
My girl likes to work the forge with her papa.
My pa says elves are bad and not to trust 'em.
Nivenor, my darling. What a pleasant surprise.
No, I think I have enough here to get started.
No, no, no. I've got more blood than you know!
No, no. I'm fine. Is there something you need?
Nobody else would even know which end to hold.
Not now! It's time to get back at these crows.
Of course, I have a small favor to ask of you.
Oh come now, resorting to petty tricks are we?
Oh, thank you. The dogs were getting restless.
Oh, very well. Just try and clean yourself up.
Oh, what delight. Another charming customer...
Oh. Good job. Here... My way of saying thanks.
On your way up the 7,000 Steps again, Klimmek?
Ooh, real tough, wagging your weapon around...
Ooh... This place really chills the blood, eh?
Our chief is strong. That is all that matters.
Perhaps there's something you wish to confess?
Perhaps you begin to see the world as a dovah.
Pff. Go away, if you know what's good for you.
Please do let me know if you change your mind.
Please, let me know if it seems safe to leave.
Ragnar has a strong arm. Pity he isn't an Orc.
Ready to spill some Imperial blood for Skyrim?
Return when you have completed the Great Hunt.
Running out of room, eh? I'll be glad to help.
Secret? What makes you think there's a secret?
See you, friend. And take it easy on the wine.
Seems we're all branded villains these days...
Shuftharz can forge you some armor, outlander.
So nice to have pleasant company for a change.
So now the pupil is the master, eh? Good show!
So the stories are true... you are Dragonborn!
Someone has to stand up to them. I won't sell.
Someone who doesn't like you asking questions.
Sondas takes care of me when mom's not around.
Sooner or later, we all have to choose a side.
Splendid! There's a house available right now.
Stand aside woman. We've come for the General.
Thank you. Blessings of Mara upon you as well.
Thank you. I'll be sure to put it to good use.
Thank you. Please, take this for your efforts.
That may be what you are here for, Dragonborn.
That was pathetic. It didn't even do anything.
That's a quick way to the executioner's block.
That's privileged information. Now move along.
The corn stores are getting low again, Orgnar.
The eyes of the law are everywhere these days.
The games have ended, time to face your death!
The Jarl does little to protect us these days.
The Jarl of Hjaalmarch has asked for our help.
The Jarl of Winterhold has asked for our help.
The mountain will eat you! Watch the mountain!
The prey is strong. Stronger than the hunters.
The question is, what isn't wrong with Riften.
The village of Ivarstead. The woman, Fastred. 
The World-Eater is dead! The way is now clear!
The world's going mad, and our Jarl does what?
Then... it's over and my death wasn't in vain.
There are a lot of good men buried here, Kust.
There is no solace in knowing what is to come.
There's plenty more work for the likes of you.
These terms are not acceptable. You know that.
They drink all day and night and what do I do?
Think you might be in the wrong place, friend.
This is going to end horribly, I just know it.
Uh, oh. You ain't gonna hurt me again, are ya?
Visit me anytime. I'm not going anywhere soon.
Wait! That's not how this is supposed to work!
We can shatter his power if we Shout together!
We carry just about anything you could need...
We don't know you, and we don't want you here.
We have a bit of a sensitive matter this time.
We love you, Dark Brotherhood! Ha ha ha ha ha!
We must hurry if we're going to defeat Ancano.
We need to move faster. Keep them off balance.
We work hard, try to do right by our families.
We'll make it, Greta. We always have so far...
We're at war, old fool, or have you forgotten?
We're looking for someone. Maybe you can help.
We're ready, Dragonborn, our wrath to unleash.
We've become aware of a problem in Winterhold.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Falkreath.
We've got to find a way to put a stop to this.
Well done. You have now passed all the trials.
Well that all depends on you, now. Doesn't it?
Well, are there any questions before we begin?
Well, everything worked out nicely, didn't it?
Well, hey there. What can Sapphire do for you?
Well, it all worked out in the end, didn't it?
Well, that depends on what you're looking for.
Well, well. Look who it is! How have you been?
Well, your ill fortune means I have no mother.
What a fascinating conversation that would be!
What are you doing? I thought we were friends!
What do you want? Can't people leave us alone?
What manner of staff is that? Such a horror...
What was that you said, venomous wife of mine?
What's happening? Damn it, what are you doing?
Why are the potions I requested not completed?
Why can't the men in this city leave me alone?
Why don't you take your coin and keep walking?
Windhelm. White as bone, and cold as the Void.
Wonderful! My lady Mara will be quite pleased!
Works for me. Tell Octieve the debt's settled.
Yeah... sure. You, too, Delphine. You be safe.
Yes, I think I'd enjoy a woman like your wife.
Yes, of course. I said I'd tell you, didn't I?
You again. Guess you need another lesson, huh?
You better not be here to stir up any trouble.
You can sell off that junk at Bits and Pieces.
You have asked for my help. I am providing it.
You heading up to High Hrothgar soon, Klimmek?
You know the rules. Just answer the questions.
You know, my father collected exotic alcohols.
You may strike me down, but your doom is near.
You picked quite a day for a trip to Markarth.
You picked quite a day for a trip to Solitude.
You really thought you could get away with it?
You saved us all. We will sing of you forever.
You think a few miles can truly keep us apart?
You want to get paid? Do what I hired you for.
You will kill. You will kill, or you will die!
You wish to learn from the best, eh? So be it.
You'll never leave this ship alive, cutthroat!
You're a natural. Never seen anythin' like it.
You're an animal, Tythis... keep away from me.
You're not one of those Alik'r thugs, are you?
You're too slow and stupid to take it from me.
You've done it... just as the prophecy said...
Zok frini grind ko grah drun viiki, Dovahkiin.
... and may we one day rejoin them in eternity.
...the Miasma... They're still here! Stop them!
A ballad? Oh, now I know you're joking with me.
A citizen of Hjaalmarch has asked for our help.
A citizen of Winterhold has asked for our help.
A dragon? In Helgen? It can't be... although...
A guest, feeling ill. Leave the poor wretch be.
A hedge against the forgetfulness of centuries.
A little late in the day for your rounds Sorex.
A Nightingale? Oh, I had no idea. My apologies.
A Stamina Potion maybe? Popular with young men.
A word of advice -- don't buy discounted armor.
Actually, I'm growing it if you hadn't noticed.
Ah. I forget. You do not have the dovah speech.
Ah. Thank you! Excellent. Now... where were we?
Alduin's defeat is the centerpiece of the Wall.
All eyes are on you, lass. Don't disappoint us.
Always a pleasure, boss. What can I do for you?
Always! Perfection takes dedication, after all!
An archer, eh? Oh, I've got just what you need.
An arrangement? After you've destroyed so much?
An old woman can get away with almost anything.
An outsider, eh? Never heard of the Companions?
And indeed, there are many that call us heroes.
And you don't want to talk to Borkul the Beast.
Another incident? I must say, I'm disappointed.
Are you joking? You just rented a room from me.
Are you making good progress with the planting?
Attention! General Tullius has an announcement!
Aww, I'm hungry! Can we get some food, instead?
Aye, I'll hate it, but I'll do it if I have to.
Aye, to your husband. Divines bless his memory.
Bah! Is there no one who can offer a challenge?
Be warned. You have been marked by the Thalmor.
Been doing a few jobs for Vex... how about you?
Been working in Iron-Breaker since I was a boy.
Better bundle up. This may keep up for a while.
Blood on the wind today. Good hunt ahead of us.
Bloody good timin'. Just got some more clients.
Bolar said you had been looking for a new wife?
Bucket. Knife. Book. Inkpot. Stone. No, no, no.
But never mind all that. We've got a job to do.
But papa was going to take me hunting tomorrow!
But you won't get any better than this from me.
By the gods... I don't even know what to say...
Certainly! It's a fine tune and a good request!
Cidhna Mine's for prisoner scum only. Keep out.
Come back to me when you have something useful.
Come on, everyone knows about you and Brynjolf.
Dear, you really ought to be careful with fire.
Did you reconsider? Will you talk to my father?
Dirge! Did you take out the trash like I asked?
Do you seek to finish that which you could not?
Don't know what you're talking about, stranger.
Don't like it? Too bad. This is our city. Ours!
Don't look up. Just focus on me. You can do it!
Either way this ends up, I'm headed to the inn.
Embrace order and hard truth, mortal. Good bye.
Fear not. Come dragon or giant, we'll be ready.
Fine, I'll get someone else to take care of it.
Follow me. We're assembling near the main gate.
Fool! The Imperial Legion will have your blood!
For a piece like that, I could pay... 500 gold?
Give me just a moment, and I'll have this open.
Gladly. He won't bother you anymore, I promise.
Good job. I can see you know what you're doing.
Good luck with the giant. Don't get stepped on.
Good steel's worth every septim. Remember that.
Good, good. Does it say where he may be headed?
Goodbye. Be careful if you head into the ruins.
Got an axe here. Good for cleaving up Forsworn.
Got horses that need shoeing, so make it quick.
Grelod is dead! Aventus did it! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha! By Shor, this city could use more like you.
Half the field? What could need half the field?
Have you gotten the items I requested from you?
He gets the books, I get you. It's very simple.
He'd be insane to try. He doesn't have the men.
He's right. Galmar, come, let us restore order.
Hello there, can I pour you a Black-Briar Mead?
Hello, my love. Back from some adventure I bet.
Here you go, ma'am. The finest Colovian brandy.
Here you go. Try not to spill anything on them.
Hey, you. Get over here, I want to talk to you.
Hey! I can't see myself! What did you do to me?
Hm. Yes, perhaps. A certain strength of spirit.
Hmm, Esbern's right. Look like pressure plates.
Hmm. This is intriguing, but highly disturbing.
How could they live like this? It's disgusting.
How much do you know about the brewing of mead?
I beg you... please. This is not what it seems!
I believed in Cicero. But he's betrayed us all.
I could swear I've seen you somewhere before...
I do the cookin' and cleanin' round the palace.
I don't have a clue. That door is impenetrable.
I don't know how you talked the Jarl into this.
I dreamt that you went away. You made monsters.
I got the message. Consider it forgotten, boss.
I hope your stay in Markarth treats you better.
I just can't fill an order that size on my own.
I need you on your feet. We're in trouble here.
I never imagined we'd find something like this.
I should've finished you when I had the chance!
I suppose you want your share now? Here you go.
I suppose you're right. I'm not a fighting man.
I think we're getting close. Let's keep moving.
I trust you aren't considering any... thievery.
I trust you'll keep your mouth shut about this.
I want no mercy for those Forsworn. Understand?
I wonder... what effect might your spells have?
I... I'm sorry. I could have sworn I sealed it.
I'd still keep an eye on my purse if I was you.
I'll be amazed if we find anything useful here.
I'll just be tending the museum if you need me.
I'll lead the way, but you'd better back me up.
I'll tell you more about it when we are nearby.
I'm certain we'll find some treasure down here.
I'm feeling much better thanks to your efforts.
I'm grateful for your efforts. Here, take this.
I'm just here to protect the Jarl, not to chat.
I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy. 
I'm sorry, Ghorza. I just... flinch, and uh....
I've been looking for a way to appease Hircine.
If anybody asks, this meeting never took place.
If I had one you could. They're all spoken for.
If only you could help bring my son back to me.
If there's anything you need, just let me know.
If you need more food or drink, speak to Hulda.
If you pass through again, stop by for a drink.
If you wish to trade, wait for the sun to rise.
Is it true? Are there really dragons in Skyrim?
It can't be... You... You took its very soul...
It helped avert attention from our true nature.
It is glorious to battle once again in Tamriel!
It is time for my splendor to return to Skyrim.
It is within you to succeed. Never forget that.
It will be a good day. I can feel it in my gut.
It will... take more than that... to stop me...
It's always good to see someone I can count on.
It's at the south end near that loose rockpile.
It's done. No more... no more talking about it.
It's down the stairs, dear. Just come right in.
It's probably best if you put that weapon away.
Joric will be what Joric will be. Give it time.
Just a few more minutes and we'll be in Riften.
Just what have you gotten yourself involved in?
Just... know that your efforts are appreciated.
Keep an eye on these Thalmor. You never know...
Keep your belly full and your shoulders strong.
Keerava, we're running low on Black-Briar Mead.
Kind of nice being in on the secret, itsn't it.
Kleppr, you idiot! Can't you do anything right?
Knife. Yes. Book. Yes. Bucket. Yes. Inkpot? No.
Lads and lasses I give you, Falmerblood Elixir!
Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can.
Look at those ruins. Think there's gold inside?
Look, I'm busy. Please go bother somebody else.
Look. Nordic ruins. I hope there's gold inside.
Looks like you've already got someone with you.
Lorkhan's eyes, you're an ugly one, aren't you?
Madame Ambassador, I'm so sorry to interrupt...
May the earth beneath your feet be always soft.
May you be saved by the Divines, as I once was.
Mining's an honest trade. No real tricks to it.
Mistress Elenwen, it's not true! I did nothing!
Much knowledge lies within the College's walls.
My dear, I am merely observing the proceedings.
My husband Mathias and I tend Corpselight Farm.
Nice weapon you got there. Care to put it away?
Nice work with this one. You make us all proud.
No one can doubt that you truly are Dragonborn.
No, but then I don't have much need for Ulfric.
No, I think I've got this one. Thanks, though. 
No. I... I was scared. I wasn't ready to sleep.
No. I'm telling you. There was no other reason.
None escape the Vigil. All come into the light.
Not Lady Dibella? No, please! I can't lose her!
Not now, please. I'm just... too upset to talk.
Now if you don't mind, I've got a city to keep.
Now, let's pledge never to speak of this again.
Now, on to the business at hand I suppose, hmm?
Of course I'm sure! He was asking about Esbern.
Oh dear, I didn't mean to say she isn't bright.
Oh, and when you're done with Virane, kill him.
Oh, good. She'll listen to you, I just know it.
Oh, it's you again. What in blazes do you want?
Oh, it's you. I didn't expect to see you again.
Oh, my aching head. Why do I do this to myself?
Oh, now we're all please and thank you, are we?
Oh, thank the gods you're in Windhelm, Calixto!
Oh. Well, if you change your mind, let me know.
Only a hearty soul travels the road these days.
Our families been close as kin for generations.
Please, leave me alone. I need to be by myself.
Please... I... I can't talk to you right now...
Purely to help safeguard the Empire, of course.
Return the gloves to me when you have finished.
Right. Lucky if it doesn't rip our throats out.
Sadly, I have yet to see it function in person.
She's watching over the others. Look alive now.
Skald, if you don't mind sir, I have a request.
Skjor... I always thought of him as invincible.
Soldiers, townspeople, and dregs into the keep!
Someone get that thing out of here and burn it.
Soon, all Nords will be thralls to the Thalmor!
Sorry, no time to talk. I need to keep playing.
Stay close and the guards will leave you alone.
Sure, you make your retreat and I'll make mine.
Talen my friend, up for some fishing this week?
Tell everyone you see to bring me some septims.
Tell me, Ragnar, what do you think of the Orcs?
Thank you for this. Something for your trouble.
Thanks again for finding out about my daughter.
Thanks. I only wish Camilla was here to see it.
That [QUOTE]boy[QUOTE] was High King of Skyrim.
That armor you got rid of. I can have it, yeah?
That journal means a lot to me, if you find it.
That Stormcloak armor's getting on my nerves...
That'd be Vald. A real piece of work, that one.
That'll teach you to break the law on my watch.
That's a touching story. Now get outta my face.
That's definitely going in my part of the Edda.
That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean.
That's just insulting. Not even a proper bribe?
That's right! Worst innkeeper in all of Skyrim!
The Blades will never be defeated, Thalmor dog.
The Dark Brotherhood is dead... and so are you!
The Great Collapse, as it has come to be known.
The latest recruit! Right? Wait, is that right?
The meal is on Namira's table. Go ahead. Carve.
The Ratway's too good of a place for that scum.
The warm sand of Elsweyr is far away from here.
The way I see it, Ulfric's fighting a holy war.
Then off with ya. I've got better things to do.
Then they should send one they consider worthy.
There isn't someone less busy who can help you?
There you are. I had wondered where you got to.
There's little time for talk, what do you want?
There's no reasoning with these people anymore.
They're in! Don't let them gain further ground!
This is insanity. We never should've come here.
This is more delicate work than you're used to.
This is Nocturnal's way of maintaining balance.
Time is of the essence here, please hurry back.
Twelve septims on the girl! Look at that speed.
Ummm, Morrowind suffered a massive explosion...
Unslaad krosis. Innumerable pardons. I digress.
Use Clear Skies to open the way to Paarthurnax.
Vittoria! There's someone I'd like you to meet.
Wait here. I'll be right back with your reward.
Wait. Wait. Don't kill me. There's another way.
Warm sands, friend. How may this one serve you?
We must make them see their danger, Dragonborn.
We must Shout together these shadows to dispel.
We never should have brought that thing here...
We should get moving. There's no time to waste.
We're all trying to become better mages, right?
We're in control of this mine. No sudden moves.
Well met, kinsman. What brings you to Whiterun?
Well now! Aren't you putting on quite the show?
Well of course, not with an attitude like that!
Well, I'll take it under advisement. Thank you.
Well, I'm getting to that. Just let me explain.
Well, let me know if you ever want to practice.
Well, there's an Imbuer here in the Great Hall.
Well, you can understand Elisif not wanting it.
Well, you're makin' friends all over, ain't ya?
Well? There must be a way through. Look around.
Well. Perhaps you'll at least consider it, hmm?
Well... that was an unpleasant bit of business.
What did it do? Is it attacking the watchtower?
What do you want? You've caused enough trouble.
What if the Forsworn come here? We aren't safe.
What is it now? We have a tasting to attend to!
What is it, woman? Sven drunk on the job again?
What news have you heard from the war, Irnskar?
What? Filthy assassin! We'll see who lies dead!
What? Well, we'll see about that now, won't we?
What? You've been lollygagging in idle reading?
What's the current spirit among the dark elves?
When are those Silver-Blood men going to leave?
Why? Because it's old, and full of dead things?
With mead and fellowship let's mend our wounds.
Would you now? Here, let me have a look at you.
Wow. You've really done it. The staff is yours.
Yes, a sign. We are lost without your guidance.
Yes, and I'm more than happy to give it to you.
Yes, old friend, I'm afraid it's not good news.
You all right? You look like you might be sick.
You asked for my help. Not for nothing, I hope?
You assured me that you could find it, however.
You can't threaten me any worse than they have!
You did this didn't you? I'll get you for this!
You have to help me, they are going to kill me!
You heard the summons. What else could it mean?
You help my people, and I'll make you my Thane.
You know, they say knowledge is its own reward.
You need steel? Speak to my forge-wife, Gharol.
You ready for some good old-fashioned burglary?
You represent Mara now. Set an example for all.
You require the services of the Fool of Hearts?
You should see me when you get bored, stranger.
You wear the garb of a true Nord. I salute you.
You'll know, You'll know the Dragonborn's come.
You're not afraid you'll set fire to something?
You've done this city a mighty service, friend.
Your efforts are in vain. It has already begun.
[QUOTE]Eyes on the prey, not the horizon.[QUOTE]
A blade! It will be as sharp as Fralia's tongue!
A note from someone named Calcelmo, in Markarth.
A pleasure as always, boss. Here's your payment.
Ah, is there any weapon finer than an Orc blade?
Ah, yes. I heard you gave him quite a thrashing.
Ahhh, a fine but bloody tale. I can do that one.
All hail the Emperor. All hail his Legionnaires!
All right, I'll entertain you a bit more. Go on.
All right. I don't want any trouble. It's yours.
Almost ever since he became leader of the tribe.
And no doubt you're one of them. Leave me alone!
And yet you have done my bidding. Why, I wonder?
Any word about our little problem in the Ratway?
Anything you steal, you bring it straight to me.
Are we really the first to make it to Riverwood?
At last, my blade is returned to its full glory.
At least the damned war hasn't gotten here. Yet.
Aye. But in the meantime, we have a war to plan.
Be careful in there, you can take a nasty spill.
Be careful out there... Riften can be dangerous.
Be careful. This woman is known to be dangerous.
Be grateful for what time I give you until then.
Betrid. No! We had a deal you Forsworn bastards!
But I thought you only cared about your fishing!
But now he's dead... and I have a new loincloth.
But the deepest, keenest hatred was for himself.
But when this war is won, I will have my parade!
By my honor, I pledge to rid Tamriel of dragons.
By Sithis, what a mess. I guess this is the end.
By the gods, he's just a retired ship's captain.
Can you believe it? Another pile of logs ruined.
Can't a woman get a moment to herself? Leave me!
Caves sounded more exciting in the bard's songs.
Clothes and raiment for the discerning customer.
Come find me if you need more marksman training.
Come now, dearie, surely we aren't all that bad.
Come on, Ton. Marry me. Let me take care of you.
Come, we will do your next test inside the hall.
Delvin and Vex have been running things for now.
Did you find a key? See if it unlocks that door.
Did you see that candle above the fire upstairs?
Do the right thing. Paarthurnax deserves to die.
Don't bother the miners. They've got work to do.
Don't worry, Shadr, your secret is safe with me.
Drafted into a war, how could my life get worse?
Dragonborn. It is you. Welcome to High Hrothgar.
Drinks here are watered down, but they're cheap.
Either way, I came back with meat for the table.
Ever think about spending more time around town?
Everyone has his weakness, and this one is mine.
Fight it, Brynjolf... he's taken control of you!
Find Arnbjorn. Make sure my husband's all right.
Find me the moment the Alik'r are taken care of.
Find yourself a weapon. You're going to need it.
Get down there and join Rikke on the front line.
Getting tired of hanging around talking all day.
Go. Bring honor to yourself, and the Companions.
Gods, you are curious. Almost... dangerously so.
Gone? Every one of them? Why, that's incredible.
Good idea, sis. Maybe you ought to be in charge!
Greetings. Welcome to the College of Winterhold.
Guests are advised to remain inside the Embassy.
Ha! Spoken like the leader of the Thieves Guild.
Hahaha! You have much to learn of the dov, then.
Have faith, mortal. I will be watching over you.
Have what? What in blazes are you talking about?
Have you managed to make it out to Shor's Stone?
Haven't seen your face before. I'm watching you.
He has some simple-minded courier delivering it?
He made my favorite dolly, but I can't find her.
Heard you hit somebody in town not too long ago.
Here, take these. Looks like you're running low.
Here, ya' did me a favor, I guess I owe you one.
Here? Right here? Very well, J'zargo shall wait.
Here... take your damn coin and get out of here!
Hey you. Yeah, you. Fresh meat for your stomach.
Hey, there's a cave. Bad place to stumble drunk.
Hmm. All right. Do you think... maybe we should?
Hmph, so you're the one everyone's falling over.
How about [QUOTE]The Lusty Argonian Maid[QUOTE]?
How did you manage to cripple yourself, Degaine?
How do you manage to hold your ground like that?
Hurt anyone with that spell and you'll be sorry.
I am Master Arngeir. I speak for the Greybeards.
I am... surprised that Gularzob was named chief.
I can hardly believe it myself, and I was there.
I cannot go into battle without a sword, Hjalti.
I couldn't ask for a better teacher than Oengul.
I do. I've been working on mine for a while now.
I don't have to take this from the likes of you.
I don't see why someone would actually use them.
I don't want to choose! They're both so amazing.
I hate those things. Too many eyes or something.
I have a present for you. A nice, shiny present.
I have to get to Markarth at once. Cut me loose.
I have traveled far across Tamriel to serve you.
I hope you're not planning on picking my pocket.
I hope you're not planning to attack me again...
I may be old, but I can show 'em a trick or two.
I must focus now. This ritual is very important.
I need at least five more, if you can find them.
I presume you're bothering me for a good reason?
I run the mill, so I'm a busy woman. What is it?
I seem to have misplaced the book I was reading.
I should lock up the store now. Thank you again.
I think I like the lake here just a little more.
I think the Thalmor are trying to steal my work!
I thought I was clear when I said I didn't know.
I told you, I don't know anything else about it.
I told you, I know everything about this castle.
I wasn't hurt, but that did make me feel better.
I will drink your blood and feast on your flesh!
I will not tolerate this offense against my kin.
I work for Belethor, at the general goods store.
I'd almost given up hope. Let me get the door...
I'd ask you maintain civility while you're here.
I'm a bard by trade. Perhaps you've heard of me?
I'm a bit busy at the moment, what did you want?
I'm doing as you asked. Not for nothing, I hope?
I'm hearing good things about you from Brynjolf.
I'm not sure. I certainly wasn't expecting this.
I'm sorry, sir. But you'll have to come with me.
I'm the commander of the guard here in Whiterun.
I've just learned not to trust luck around here.
If I had one. Sold my last one to you a bit ago.
If they love me not, how can my love reach them?
If you find any more candidates bring them here.
If you persist in this stubbornness I'll have...
If you'll excuse me, I must return to my duties.
Ignoring me, huh? Suit yourself. Get 'em Hewnon!
In all my years, I've never seen such a thing...
Indeed. I... I thought you captured the Butcher.
Irileth, send a detachment to Riverwood at once.
Is he responsible for this? The Arch-Mage, dead?
Is that so? And what were you thinking, exactly?
Is that so? We shall see, villain. We shall see!
It doesn't matter. He wears that armor, he dies.
It's amazing how much you can learn from a book.
It's good that you brought this to my attention.
It's held in a Hagraven nest called Orphan Rock.
It's hopeless. He told me. He's right, you know.
It's not so simple as just killing them, though.
It's only because I've had an excellent teacher.
It's time to put the weapon away now. Thank you.
It's too late for that. Leave me. Save yourself.
Just kill him and let's be done with it already.
Karthwasten has enough problems. Leave us alone.
Kodlak was right. I let vengeance rule my heart.
Learn a library's worth of knowledge in moments!
Let me out of here, damn it! I'm not a criminal!
Let's get this door open and see what we've got.
Lightly armored means light on your feet. Smart.
Like anyone would even notice, in all this mess.
Look at you! Betcha think you're something, huh?
Look at you! You're as filthy as a pig in a pen!
Look, I got the message. What else did you want?
Lookee here. Looks like we got ourselves a hero.
Looks like I chose the right person for the job.
Make them all pay for what they've done to me...
May the light of truth keep the darkness at bay.
My favorite drinking buddy! Let's get some mead.
My favorite drinking buddy. Let's get some mead.
My tunic is fading. Too much sun and salt spray.
New in town, eh? Here for the fishing I'd guess.
No one dies. Remember that. We're not assassins.
no subtitles - indecipherable giant combat barks
No? So you don't know anything about my brother?
Nothing like the smell of a white-hot blade, eh?
Now tell me, Dragonborn, why have you come here?
Now, let us bury the memory of these dark deeds.
Now, let's pretend we never had this discussion.
Now, you don't let Rogatus cause you any bother.
Of course I'm sure! She was asking about Esbern.
Of course. Just bring it to me when you find it.
Oh yes... you'll need one of my special brews...
Oh, I like that! Very good, very good! Creative!
Oh, I'm fine, Enmon. I just... I still miss her.
Oh, my mistake then. Sorry, you can go on ahead.
Oh, my. You'll want to talk to Enmon about that.
Oh, so you're the one in charge now? Fine, fine.
Oh, Sven. You do know how to turn a girl's head.
Oh, this pendant would look lovely on my sister.
Oh! I don't feel any different. What did you do?
Oh! Oh, you jest! You jest with gullible Cicero!
On my honor, I won't bother Carlotta ever again.
One more time, and the World-Eater must face us!
Our sweet Lady is maiden, mother... and crone...
Ours. Soon the Lexicon's knowledge will be ours.
Perhaps you'd care to put your weapon away? Hmm?
Please, relax. Free your mind. Yes, that's it...
Poor mother... Her new home seems so very far...
Potema herself? Please tell me you stopped them.
Protect yourself right... buy armor from Grelka.
Really? Well, allow me to clarify the situation.
Remember, your mind is the best weapon you have.
Remember. Ale is cheaper than blood in Markarth.
Seems like most of these are nine parts fiction.
She gets the books, I get you. It's very simple.
She's mine! She's my reward. You can't have her!
Shor's bones. We were too late. Damn the Empire.
Should they accept her rule, we will have peace.
Show us, Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice.
Sing you a special song tonight, beautiful lass?
So, Tythis... you coming by the Bunkhouse later?
So, what do you think of my plan. You in or out?
So, you've come to see me to sell or to buy? Hm?
Soft sheets and hard liquor. What's not to like?
Sold. She's all yours. She's already saddled up.
Sondas, does Hrefna ever mention Meieran to you?
Sorry about the smell. It's a stable, after all.
Sovngarde take your soul. I'll avenge your body.
Stay away from my family if you value your life.
Stay outta trouble, or there's gonna be trouble.
Stop that! How can I do my job if I'm invisible?
Sure you can handle that? Ha! Of course you can.
Sure, walk away. I wasn't talking or anything...
Take your books and go, before I change my mind.
Tekla. The Hall is filthy. See to your cleaning.
Thank you, Madena. I appreciate your assistance.
Thank you, Runil. Your support means much to us.
That crown must be here somewhere. Keep looking.
That mace... get it away from me. Get it away...
That's all they are... rumors. So quit worrying.
That's just terrible. I'm so sorry to hear that.
That's what I'm here for. What are you offering?
The Circle are the ones who parcel out the jobs.
The deed is done. We need speak of it no longer.
The door is hidden, but I will show you the way.
The Emperor is going to love it. How can he not?
The Gildergreen blooms again. All thanks to you.
The Imperials are here in force. Stick together.
The Imperials will be sorry they got in our way.
The Jarls are upset. They don't all support you.
The only unusual thing is the shape of the cuts.
The path is closed, till your courage is tested.
The Silver Hand. I think you've met them before.
Their tears shine the ebony to a sharpest gleam.
Then we have nothing more to say to one another.
Then what are we waiting for? Let's get started!
Then, well... you got a taste. Stronger, faster.
These pillars must have something to do with it.
They will hunt him while you delay. Your choice.
They'll never suspect an attack from the inside.
They're lording it over us all the time, though.
This damned war has cost us... me... everything.
This mine will be our grave yet. I just know it.
This really isn't turning out the way I'd hoped.
Those rebels better not try coming to Haafingar.
Tilma will keep the place clean. She always has.
True enough, you cur. Back to work, I suppose...
Truly? So maybe my mother isn't crazy after all.
Trust me, we have nothing to say to one another.
Ugh... dark sorcery. Always makes my skin crawl.
Wallow in your wretchedness, my newest champion.
We have to catch up to him before it's too late.
We made it. Windhelm. Hope you enjoyed the ride.
We must keep faith in ourselves and the Divines.
We'll need to visit each home for an assessment.
We're not leaving until we get what we came for.
Well met, traveler. What brings you to Whiterun?
Well now. What have we here? A lost little lamb?
Well, I suppose some kind of speech is in order.
Well, this is a nice mess you've gotten me into.
What are you looking at? Scared of strong women?
What are you people doing outside? Go home. Now!
What is it doing? Walking around nearly naked...
What is that half-naked fetcher trying to prove?
Whatever you've heard I can do is probably true.
When the time is right, friend. When we're sure.
When you're ready, meet me at Snow Veil Sanctum.
Where did all these pretty red plants come from?
Who do you think killed more rebels? You? Or me?
Why did they do that? Why would they be so evil?
Wish everyone haggled like you. She's all yours.
Without it, we're just a bunch of petty thieves.
Worried one of them is going to take your place?
Wouldn't want to sully his reputation, would we?
Yeah, but Twice-Killed has more of a ring to it!
Yeah, I guess I have a minute. What do you want?
Yeah, sure, I understand. No need to decide now.
Yes, I know. The general acted with my blessing.
Yes, mother. I'm eager to prove my skills today.
Yes, that's it. The symbol on the middle pillar.
Yes, well, see that you keep at it. That is all.
Yes, well... That's all we ask of you. Carry on.
You are on the right path, and you will prevail.
You are speaking to Larak, chief of Mor Khazgur.
You Bards don't cut each other any slack do you?
You cannot even conceive of the power I wield...
You do something out of line, I'll put you down.
You don't think this is a war already? Sir, I...
You hungry? There's plenty of food. Eat up, now.
You just can't leave well enough alone, can you?
You know, there might be gold somewhere in here.
You know... you ain't so bad. Here. Take this...
You once told me you did not believe in destiny.
You really should put on some clothes, you know.
You really think the Staff of Magnus is the key?
You there! Serving girl! What's your name, dear?
You wouldn't attack an old man again, would you?
You'd better clear out before someone gets hurt.
You're closer to understanding than you realize.
You're going to rot in the Dragonsreach Dungeon.
You're married, yes? To that young metal worker?
You're not supposed to play with fire, you know.
You're trespassing here. You'd better clear out.
You've got a deal. It's the one with the saddle.
You've no time to glory in your accomplishments.
Your enemies will soon know the wrath of Sithis.
Your fruit are looking a little less ripe today.
Ysmir's beard - I don't like the look of this...
A fine place to trap one of Alduin's allies, hmm?
A smart man came and told us about a blade piece.
Actually, I admire how you handled the situation.
Ah good, back for some more Black-Briar mead, eh?
Ah yes. I remember your name from the guest list.
Ah, my parlor. No finer place to boil eyes, no...
Ah, Ysolda was it? What brings you to the market?
Ah. Well, then. Let me know if you need anything.
Alduin has returned, just like the prophecy said!
All right, let's try something a bit more... fun.
All right, we'll start again, but watch yourself.
Alright, if it's a fight you want. You've got it.
And here's a little something for helping me out.
Another piece of glory. Good work, Shield-Sister.
Are you looking for any specific volumes, Drevis?
Are you ready to test yourself at Fort Hraagstad?
Ay, it can. Wouldn't want them any bigger though.
Be glad to repair any damage to your Guild armor.
Because, because you are such a nice Breton, yes!
Bless you, Lady of Shadows... I live another day.
Brought me more than some Firebrand Wine I trust?
But don't do anything rash if you go to Windhelm.
But don't you get it? She thought he was a troll!
But if you want to get yourself killed, go ahead.
But you were not placed in harm's way on purpose.
Can you not hear me? Are your ears full of hate? 
Captain, have you heard these stories of dragons?
Captain. What should we do? He's not on the list.
Careful, boys. There's bound to be more up ahead.
Carry on, Lonely-Gale. And loosen yourself a bit.
Clear out the chamber, and I'll give you the key.
Clearly you've never spent any time in Morrowind.
Come back later and I may have some work for you.
Come back when you figure out how to spend money.
Come back when you're in the Guild's good graces.
Congratulations on getting the festival restored.
Damn Imperials. They won't hold Dawnstar forever.
Delphine, we're not here to rehearse old grudges.
Despite the shame, this one can't help but stare.
Did you have some sort of official business here?
Do you ever think about them, Esbern? The others?
Does the journal say where this wealth came from?
Don't fear the unknown, the hidden, the wretched.
Don't know what that man expects. House is empty.
Don't know what that was, but don't try it again.
Don't waste time apologizing, just find the book!
Don't you see? Elven supremacy is the only truth!
Dying breed, eh? Well what do you call that then!
Either I'm drunk, or you're naked. Possibly both.
Enthusiasm. Good. Here's the key to the dig site.
Filth. Run to the horizon before I hunt you down.
For now. The Blades' memory is long, as you know.
Get down there and join Galmar on the front line.
Give Mercer my regards when you return to Riften.
Go... go right ahead then. Don't let me keep you.
Gonna split your belly like an old woman's purse!
Good enough for me. It's the one with the saddle.
Good hunting. I'll see you back at the Sanctuary.
Good. I was hoping you hadn't forgotten about it.
Ha ha! Oh, I knew I had a good feeling about you!
Ha! Drink ain't gonna kill me. Not today, anyway.
Ha! I'd sooner bend my knee to Ulfric Stormcloak.
Ha! The most important question of all, that one.
Ha. Another milk drinker crying about his effort.
Here we are. Solitude. Safe and sound, as always.
Here you are. Now I'm anxious to see you cast it.
Here, let me get you some mead. This one's on me.
Here, let me show you how an Orc learns to smith.
Hmmf. Maybe you're the one talking to him then...
Hmmm, the Potage le Magnifique. Smells delicious.
Hopefully that answer will satisfy you. Good day.
How can a humble servant of Talos help you today?
How's it going, Unblooded? You find anything yet?
Hrm. You go find your own wreck. This one's mine.
Hroggar's house? It burned down not too long ago.
I can feel their heartbreak swelling in my blade.
I can't believe we're the only ones who survived.
I can't do this. We shouldn't be here. I'm sorry.
I can't really help you, I'm just Dengeir's maid.
I could get rich and stop selling these trinkets.
I could learn a lot from the people in this room.
I don't have time for idle chit-chat. What is it?
I fear for what this change will do to my family.
I find your presence... unnerving. Please depart.
I hope I can count on you if I ever need a favor.
I just hope this party doesn't drag on all night.
I left behind my daughter Uaile when I was taken.
I need you to come with me immediately. Let's go.
I should bash your face in after all you've done.
I suppose you should go to the docks and... swim?
I think you and I have some things to talk about.
I thought it was finally going to be a quiet day.
I thought you were a wizard. Hit me with a spell!
I tried to look for her, but she never turned up.
I will thank you not to interrupt me in my tasks.
I... I'm not one for talk. Try to keep to myself.
I... knew Veren and Thorek. They were my friends.
I'll give you another chance, but watch yourself.
I'll give you one good reason. Maven Black-Briar.
I'll have to take your word on that one, my dear.
I'm afraid you don't have anything worth trading.
I'm diverting Gar and Haddring's men to join him.
I'm in charge now that my parents are in Morthal.
I'm lucky to have a man that is so devoted to me.
I'm sorry, I'm still a bit dizzy from everything.
I'm spoken for, you know. So don't get any ideas.
I'm the Jarl, not a barkeep. Speak your business.
I've already told you everything I know, I swear.
I've been hearing rumors of Silver Hand activity.
I've been invited to dinner.... I'm so hungry....
I've been there before, but I don't know it well.
If break-ins are more your thing, go talk to Vex.
If I had it, I'd pay! There's no need to do that!
If it does to you, dear, that's all that matters.
If you need help drawing some blood, let me know.
If you seek either, you've found the right place.
Indeed. The temple here in the city is my charge.
Is he? You've saved him?! I must see him at once!
It was like he was daring us to come and get him.
It's no fun getting pushed around all the time...
It's not really a fair comparison, if you ask me.
It's the root that looks like an ugly little man.
It's under your feet, lad. Just follow the smell.
It's very unfortunate that you've been suspended.
It's where men have tested their mettle for ages.
J'zargo awaits word of how well his scrolls work.
Just be patient, aunt. She'll have it, I promise.
Just keep putting one foot in front of the other.
Keep a sharp lookout. We can't afford any delays.
Keep in song in your heart to ward off the gloom.
Keep your wits about you and you won't be harmed.
Leave me alone. Can't an old man have some peace?
Let me know if there's something you need to buy.
Let see what adornments I might have available...
Let the field mouse run. Your pay will be double.
Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us.
Let's keep moving. That thing is still out there.
Let's wait until Brynjolf's here before we begin.
Life is far too short, my friend. Don't waste it!
Look, I'm very busy, so this better be important.
Looking to protect yourself, or deal some damage?
May your sword be sharp, and your tongue sharper.
Maybe to you, but he's just so... his story is...
Maybe you'd like to try the horker? Or some beef?
Maybe you're looking for something... particular?
Mercer was able to knock this thing down? Gods...
My boy Leontius lives in Old Hroldan. Damn drunk.
My business is my own. Why can't others see that?
My mind weighs heavy enough. Leave me to my food.
My scouts tell me they're loading them with fire.
My sister Camilla or I will be happy to help you.
Next thing I know, I've used up most of my stock.
No surprise, but one of them's gotten out. Again.
No, I'm afraid I don't know anything of the sort.
No, not gone... he's become one with the shadows.
No! Don't leave me here! I beg you to let me out!
No. Kill him. Crush his bones. Tear at his flesh.
No... No! You must be the one who took my skooma!
Nocturnal seemed quite pleased with your efforts.
Not really my usual read, but I'll give it a try.
Now let's, um, not talk about this anymore. Okay?
Now was it two parts giant lichen or three? Hm...
Now, do you have a reason for making such a mess?
Now, let's pretend this never happened, shall we?
Oh come on, are you talking about the Snow Elves?
Oh dear. You're going to kill me now, aren't you?
Oh really? Well, I'm not going to hold my breath.
Oh yes. And I've decided you will have the honor.
Oh, don't worry about me. I relish the challenge.
Oh, got a bit of an interest in your boss do you?
Oh, hello there. I didn't expect to see you here.
Oh, just a matter of finding the right suppliers.
Oh, that sounds nice. Yes, I think I'll join you.
Oh, well. You know. A bit of this, a bit of that.
Oh, yes yes yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Oh! I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
Oh! Um, he he... Hold on... I... I can explain...
Or give you strength if you happen to offend one.
Orders are to wait until General Tullius arrives.
Orgnar, hold down the bar for a minute, will you?
Our ancestors should be allowed to rest in peace.
Out. She owns the place, she does what she wants.
People to see and places to go, huh? Later, then.
Perhaps, perhaps. I'm not quite sure what I need.
Places where you can overhear things. See things.
Please stay away while you got that spell on you.
Please, open the door. I need to get out of here.
Please, you must set this right. I'm begging you.
Real Nords like to prove their mettle in the pit.
Remember to put in a good word with Maven for me.
Remember, when you kill - we all wield the blade.
Send another one in here! Send two! I don't care!
She looked so fragile. Helpless prey. And then...
She said you threw her into a goat pen yesterday.
Should have picked somebody else for your dinner.
Sigh. You win. Tell Shadr he can forget the debt.
Skyrim will never again bow to your false Empire!
So we're ready to start this war in earnest then?
So you do. Thank you, this will help quite a bit.
Some nights I dream about the mists of Sovngarde.
Someday I'm going to kill a dragon all by myself.
Sorry, my ears aren't so good. You say somethin'?
Speak to Vex. We have nothing else to talk about.
Stay clear of the Forsworn. Bloodthirsty savages.
Sure, feel free to hand me all the gold you want.
Sure, I don't mind taking some more of your gold.
Take care, and go with the blessings of the Nine.
Thalmor filth, eh? Giving all Khajiit a bad name.
Thank you, Thonar. That's generous of you to say.
That he worries about being chased from Whiterun.
That looks like the way out! I knew we'd make it!
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
That's all there is to it, Dragonborn. Good luck.
That's nothing you need to concern yourself with.
That's some fine Imperial armor you've got there.
The ale is going bad. We need to get a new batch.
The box contains the heart. The essence of a god.
The College has developed some theories, however.
The Emperor's cousin is dead! This is a disaster!
The Lexicon had better be worth all this trouble.
The more important question is: why are you here?
The only thing I understand is you bothering you.
The other... Well, that can only be Labyrinthian.
The pettiness of mortals. I had almost forgotten.
The return certainly seems worth the risk though.
The visions continue to hold me in balance, Gorm.
The Wheelstone? Have you decided to sell it, yet?
There must be another way. The risk is too great.
There's another door. See if you can get it open.
Think about how ridiculous that sounds. Come now.
This can't be true. I've known Mercer too long...
This doesn't concern you, [QUOTE]citizen.[QUOTE] 
This is how the Empire repays us for our loyalty?
This is it men! It's time to make this city ours!
This isn't the military, son. There are no ranks.
This metal will serve the forge well, my brother.
This one wonders why you brandish your weapon so?
This place is coming down. Let's get out of here!
This wedding is boring. I wish they had jugglers.
Those draugr are going to be back. I can feel it.
Try dripping blood onto the carving on the floor.
Ugh, you smell horrible. Get yourself cleaned up.
Ugh. Get this awful paper away from me, by Talos!
Um... thank you, Lash. You'd... make a fine Nord?
Viola, dark elves sleep just like the rest of us.
Visitors like us are rare in this part of Skyrim.
Wait until the ceremony is over, then we'll talk.
We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness.
We must move quickly to prevent further violence.
We're at war with Leigelf? Isn't he your husband?
We're not quite ready to muster the final attack.
Well hey, that's not something you see every day.
Well then, it's too bad my wife is already taken.
Well Ulfric, you can't escape from me this time. 
Well, well. I was looking for this little beauty.
Well? You going to scout ahead or travel with me?
What a waste! There must be a dozen men up there!
What are you doing here? I told them no visitors.
What are you talking about? What's in the letter?
What could drive a man to do something like this?
What did I do? Please, whatever it is, I'm sorry.
What did you tell him? Why did you do this to me?
What good are fish if you have to eat them alone?
What? And you call yourself a daughter of Skyrim?
What's happened to the Gildergreen is a travesty.
What's your trouble? Dasturn telling tales again?
Whatever you need, Dragonborn. Just say the word.
When are you going to stop by the temple, Madesi?
Which calls to you, Dovahkiin? Fus, Feim, or Yol?
Why are all these metal... things... ignoring us?
Wilhelm was pleased with the delivery, well done.
Yeah, you're right. Maybe it's not the best idea.
Yes, I thought we'd gotten past that bit already.
Yes, yes. What is it? We're all very busy here...
You can stay, but you're not supposed to be here.
You can't have the Axe! It's all I have left now!
You cannot eat Gleda! Gleda is protected by Grok!
You could, you know, let me out of this cage now.
You do realize there's only one way this can end.
You got me, fair and square. Tell Haran I'll pay.
You Imperials are efficient, I'll give you that. 
You looking for anything in particular this time?
You must defeat guardian beasts, blessed by Kyne.
You shouldn't play around with magic like that...
You want this one to become a Blade? You're sure?
You will pay for Malyn's death, Azura worshipper!
You... You're wrong! You can't hurt me anymore...
You're doing me quite a favor. I won't forget it.
You're going to get us all killed, you damn fool!
You're right. She'll be a great Sybil, won't she?
You're the one casts those illusions. Impressive.
You're trying to frighten me, hmm? Do your worst!
Your power over others shall be great, like mine.
Ysmir's beard, you're going to freeze to death...
...never enough gold... just need one good haul...
A captive dragon, just think of the possibilities!
A hundred septims says I can take ya, bare-handed.
A new day is dawning. And you shall be its herald.
Actually... on second thought, I'll just kill you!
After all this, I have to pick up and leave again?
Ah, at last! I hope you found the place all right.
Ah, I see. Well, just be careful around my things!
Ah, Nivenor. What can I sell you on this fine day?
Ah! A fellow latecomer to Elenwen's little soiree.
Ah. But I have my own champion this time, Logrolf.
Ain't nothin' a boy can do that I can't do better.
All right, all right, let's not get too hasty now.
All right, just because it's you, we'll try again.
All right. Tell the old man his debts are settled.
An Amulet of Mara? You're not married? Surprising.
And he specifically mentioned the Staff of Magnus?
And I told you I'd pay it when I'm good and ready.
And in my line of work, extra hands are well-paid.
And it shows, I've seen horkers with smaller guts.
And it won't end here. I'd die before I went back.
And thank you for your help. You're a good friend.
Another piece of glory. Good work, Shield-Brother.
Are you joking? Go earn a living and stop loafing!
Babette, my girl - pack your things. We're moving.
Battle reveals who a man really is. Remember that.
Be careful men. There's bound to be more up ahead.
Between you and me, she could use a bit of warmth.
Brave hearts beat lesser ones. That's the decider.
But then... out of nowhere... a dragon attacked...
But where will I go? I can't keep running forever!
But... there's no way to know what Shout is meant.
By the Divines, the Forsworn are here in the city!
Can you make some new poultices for my...you know?
Can't talk. Mulush will beat me if I stop working.
Captain. What should we do? She's not on the list.
City's got eyes. Be careful when you're out there.
Clever. To think, now I could... Well, never mind.
Come at me. You couldn't hurt me if you wanted to.
Come inside. The other masters will meet us there.
Come on, we need to show the journal to the Guild.
Come. You, too. We can escape through the tunnels.
Crazy n'wah - you're trying to get someone killed?
Damn. It's like everyone in this city has amnesia.
Did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?
Didn't muck it up I hear. Good. Here's your share.
Do you have business with the East Empire Company?
Don't make me the fool and let me down, all right?
Dragonborn? What do you know about the Dragonborn?
Either pour another drink or keep moving, Ambarys.
Enough! That's enough. I surrender... I surrender.
Excellent. Here, this is the key to the warehouse.
Farewell, father. I'll return as soon as I'm able.
First, we're attacking the fort. I want that fort.
Fjotli...  Fjotli... Where have I heard that name?
Fruit, fresh off the boat! The freshest in Skyrim!
Get up to Winterhold. We're going to take it back.
Gods above... that's better news than I had hoped!
Good morning, Assur. What do you want to do today?
Good to see you. Finally someone useful is around.
Goraan! I feel younger than I have in many an age.
Ha ha ha ha ha! You wish to defeat me? Impossible.
Halt in the name of the Jarl Balgruuf the Greater!
Haven't I always been a good father? A good chief?
Haven't seen you here before, egg sister. Welcome!
He's the sorry bastard who's going to be executed.
Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done.
Hey! What the... keep your damn magic to yourself.
Hircine chose you to lead the Great Hunt. So lead.
Hold your head up. I'm sure it won't happen again.
How are the new breeds getting along with my dogs?
How are we supposed to feel safe in our own homes?
I bet Naris gets a kick out it. Nasty fella he is.
I can provide you with some help with her minions.
I can't. If I do, I may as well cut my own throat.
I don't even like our Jarl havin' a  court wizard.
I don't like bunking with Orcs. It's not... clean.
I don't mean you any trouble. Just leave me alone.
I envy you the chance to see this dragon up close!
I got enough troubles, so don't go adding to them.
I guess someone else will be taking his room, now.
I hate those damn things. Too many eyes, you know?
I heard about what you did. You hurt someone. Bad.
I heard you hurt someone in town not too long ago.
I help my father in more ways than people realize.
I hope Fastred's doing well in Riften. I miss her.
I hope Mirabelle is helpful in locating the Staff.
I know I ran ahead with the claw, but I need help!
I mine. Work the smelter. Ain't much else to tell.
I never heard of Tiber Septim killing any dragons.
I noticed a trail of blood leading away from here.
I prefer a good roast duck. But your soup will do.
I really need to get back to planning my wedding..
I should be back in Windhelm. I've got work to do.
I should hire you to be my assistant at this rate.
I still need some help, if you can spare the time.
I sure hope there's a way out somewhere down here.
I think given time, you'll understand what I mean.
I thought adventurers were supposed to look tough?
I thought the festival wasn't happening this year.
I tried to tell them, but none of them believe me.
I want word on our campaign against the Imperials.
I wanted to ask you something. It's about a boy...
I warned you. You leave me no choice but violence.
I was expecting more though, you'd better be good.
I was just getting settled in. Where are we going?
I was lucky to get children out of the ones I did.
I was starting to think you might never come back.
I, uh, I can't tell Thongvor. It's anyone's guess.
I'd like to pay you to hurt somebody else. For me.
I'll see you at home, then. Don't keep me waiting!
I'll take a sword or mace over a pick axe any day.
I'm Ghorza's assistant. I help her with the forge.
I'm glad I finally got a chance to see this place.
I'm going to track down that thief and murder him!
I'm just here to dig. Not much else to talk about.
I'm keeping Arnleif and Sons going, as best I can.
I'm looking forward to our wedding. You and me....
I'm not hiding anything. It's closed for a reason.
I'm paid to wait to take you home. Enjoy yourself.
I'm pretty sure she up and joined the Stormcloaks.
I'm ready. I made my peace with the gods long ago.
I'm sorry to turn you away. I hope you understand.
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm sure Arngeir would call it one of my failings.
I'm the brewmaster around here. What did you want?
I've been in charge of Dawnstar for over 35 years.
I've been thinking we need to be more... discreet.
I've seen fresh recruits with more skill than you!
If I needed something from you, you would know it.
If I tell you, you need to promise not to kill me.
If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get.
If that's what you want. I'll see you there, soon.
If you find that sword, traveler, I'd be grateful.
If you need pickpocket training, just let me know.
If you're staying the night, I've got a free room.
In your dreams! If I win, the next round's on you!
Is it daylight out? Night? I lose track down here.
It doesn't matter. It's also none of your concern.
It doesn't matter. She wears that armor, she dies.
It feels good to walk the streets of Riften again.
It may be dead now, but... where did it come from?
It will be good to finally be able to return home.
It's an honorable craft. I'll show you what I can.
It's done, then. Justice, if you can call it that.
It's under your feet, lass. Just follow the smell.
Just when you think things couldn't get any worse.
Keep going! We need to get farther away from here!
Keep it busy. I'll try to drain some of its power!
Keep the faith. General Tullius will win this war.
Khajiit is just a guard, and has no wares to sell.
Krosis. Sorrowfully, no. It cannot be known to me.
Last time you said he was fighting for the Empire.
Let me know if you hear anything more substantial?
Let's find Fjotra. This place gives me the creeps.
Let's just hope it stays this way for a long time.
Look along the east coast. The boat will be there.
Look, you must have me confused with someone else.
Looks like we weren't the first ones here, either.
M'aiq has heard it is dangerous to be your friend.
Malacath rewards the strong and punishes the weak.
May you lose yourself in the pages of a good book!
Maybe not, but you certainly aren't the good guys.
My son died. Things won't be the same without him.
Name's Nils. I'm the cook up at Candlehearth Hall.
New blood? Oh, hello. I'm Farkas. Come, follow me.
New blood? Oh, I remember you. Come on, follow me.
No matter. Another one will be along any time now.
No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up.
No, I suspect Skyrim to be my home for many years.
No, mother. The execution will proceed as planned.
No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening.
No! Aunt Agna! Talos, why didn't I go in with her?
Not all can hear the broad echoes of deepest dawn.
Not bad. Reminds me when I first started smithing.
Not until we're all ready. We have to go together.
Now what do you say? Shall we go kill us a dragon?
Now... Now we see whether my theories are correct.
Of course she will. She's our daughter, after all.
Oh she will, mark my words. And don't you let her.
Oh, good point. I wish my head were made of rocks.
Oh, good. I was afraid I'd have to go ask J'zargo.
Oh, good. I was afraid I'd have to rely on Onmund.
Oh, good. I was really afraid I'd lose it forever.
Oh, someone's going to get hurt, I just know it...
Oh. Okay. So we should try to... what? Capture it?
Okay, lass. We've got these getups on... now what?
Once sailing gets in your blood, it don't get out.
Once you leave the party you can't just come back.
One lives for the things he is willing to die for.
Only worry we've got is the war reaching this far.
Otherwise Vilkas will just say I was making it up.
Perhaps someday I'll reopen a shop here in Skyrim.
Perhaps we might share a carriage after the party?
Perhaps. But what is it you expect to find within?
Please step back, there's an execution in process.
Please, just let me handle it. It's not a problem.
Please, leave me to recover my... mental energies.
Plenty of ways to worship the Divines as you know.
Protect yourself! We're under some kind of attack!
Put that thing away. You're making people nervous.
Quit your bellyaching. We've all got our problems.
Really? All right! You pick. Tag or hide-and-seek?
Remember, being a bard isn't just about the music.
Remember, speak only to Enthir. Trust no one else.
Rest up, scum. Probably getting executed tomorrow.
Right, but if you plow the soil with fire salts...
Right. Well, you let me know if you need anything.
See if one of these chests has some armor for you.
So far so good. Let's hope nobody saw us slip out.
So good to see you again. How can I be of service?
So long as you can back up those words with steel.
So nice to get this break from my cleaning duties.
So that's it, then. [QUOTE]Don't come back.[QUOTE]
So, feeling loose? How about you run a job for me.
So, you're saying you brought that cat down alone?
Speak to Yamarz. Convince him to let you help him.
Stand away from me, or I'll crack you like an egg.
Stay where you are. The mother will deal with you.
Steal anything from my shop, and you'll regret it.
Stop it, both of you. You're acting like children.
Take care, and go with the blessings of the Eight.
Talk to me again when you've cleaned up your mess.
Thank you, Jarl Elisif. I appreciate your loyalty.
Thank you. Take it to Quintus, in the White Phial.
Thanks for convincing Elisif to put this on again.
Thanks for sticking around and keeping me company.
That Valga Vinicia is a gossip and a troublemaker.
That's it! Wonderful! I knew I could count on you.
That's what I wanted to hear. Good luck out there.
The axe isn't the only item dear old Clavicus has.
The citizens of Whiterun are forever in your debt!
The Forsworn will reclaim what is rightfully ours!
The key to wards is that they take time to charge.
The rebellion is over. Ulfric Stormcloak is dead. 
The townsfolk won't go near it. Superstitious lot.
The witless fool and his pet corpse? Take a guess.
Then it got cold and dark. I'm not scared anymore.
Then prepare yourself to receive Stendarr's Mercy.
Then your poverty is my reward. Kill or be killed!
There are others who would gladly accept my favor.
There will be a feast in our honor when we return.
There's a cave here. Think we should check it out?
There's enough for all of us if you aren't greedy.
There's one more thing. We know about Paarthurnax.
There's talk of it, but I find it hard to believe.
These workers. Always complaining. Always excuses.
They are indeed. Nothing like your mother, though!
They don't like us talking to people when we work.
They have to be reasonable about it at some point.
They won't be expecting an attack from the inside.
They're waiting for you in the cistern. No tricks.
They've got a mage hiding in that window up there!
They've grown, all right - lazier and more stupid.
This is a fine wedding. And to think, it's for us.
This is my realm. I won't let you take it from me!
Those draugr are going to come up and kill us all.
Time to finally see the sky, and make it rain red.
To feed my power when I come for you in Sovngarde!
To Oblivion with the rest of them - save yourself!
Try casting a spell at the wall. See what happens!
Ugh. Your breath is foul. What've you been eating?
Use the key to open the door! We have to be quick!
Vilkas, here, will be the one testing your mettle.
Wait. Did you hear that? I think it came this way.
Wake me up when you're ready to fight me for real.
Watch out some gray-skin doesn't pick your pocket.
We are thieves, you fool. We're stealing the cube.
We couldn't have taken this city without you, sir.
We don't get a lot of travelers here in Riverwood.
We have no alternative. It's the will of Vaermina.
We're counting on you to make this all worthwhile.
Well great! Let's see anyone try to hurt me now...
Well look at us. Like two gray specks in the snow.
Well now, that is something. Hand it over, please.
Well, I'm glad that little unpleasantness is over.
Well, looks like you're fitting in well down here.
Well, well. If it isn't Brynjolf's little protege.
Well, yes, but... there's no guarantee, of course.
Well, you seem like the honest sort. Here you are.
Well, you're certainly making a name for yourself.
What? Have you forgotten your oath to the Emperor?
What? You're... can it really be true? Dragonborn?
What's that supposed to prove? Get back on patrol!
What's... what's happening... I can't stop myself.
Whatever I can to put my family here back to rest.
Where are you going? The barracks is through here!
Who would have thought I would be getting married?
Whoa, not so fast there, friend. You owe me money.
Why delay? Please, take your seat so we can begin.
Why else have they cursed me? Killed all my wives?
Why would I do that? There's work to be done here.
Wish I did, but some outlander bought my last one.
Wish the Jarl's wizard would up and leave with ya.
Wonderful. Please follow me, and don't wander off.
Yeah, he's after Ra'jirr- never seen him so angry.
Yes, I heard. I think all of Skyrim knows by know.
Yes, my lady. I will pass the good news on to her.
Yes, Thongvor. I'll draft the letter immediately. 
Yes, yes. Here it is. I think I'd best be off now.
Yes. I hope this will be enough to maintain order.
You are a very brave man. But I already knew that.
You are new here, are you not? We have not spoken.
You aren't as attractive as you'd like to believe.
You can have anything except the scroll of course.
You cannot defeat us! The Dragonborn still stands!
You do have a plan for luring a dragon here, yeah?
You don't look so good. Are you feeling all right?
You ever need my steel by your side, you just ask.
You have no business in our stronghold, outlander.
You have reconsidered my offer, hmm? Onikaan kron?
You know how to throw a punch, I'll give you that.
You look like someone who appreciates nice things.
You look like you've seen your share of adventure.
You look troubled. Have you come seeking guidance?
You must be new. We don't talk to each other here.
You really don't know anything about this, do you?
You see - Paar-thur-nax - a Thu'um - a Shout, yes?
You there! Ah... citizen. This area is off limits.
You there. You another Imperial puppet? Answer me.
You will die in terror, knowing your final fate...
You worry too much, brother. Victory will be ours.
You wouldn't attack an old woman again, would you?
You. Who are you to approach the Jarl of Markarth?
You're a strapping young man. Don't be a stranger.
You're an idiot, Kleppr. Why did I ever marry you?
You're interfering with official Thalmor business.
You're not from around here. That makes two of us.
You're not going to get richer with that attitude.
You're that one from the College. Heard about you.
You've been digging around where you don't belong.
...tra la la, tra la lee, da da dum dum, dee dee...
[QUOTE]Your legend is lies, lurid and false;[QUOTE]
After that I promised myself I'd never do it again.
Ah yes, my matchmaker. What is it I can do for you?
Ah, but business! Of course. What kind of business?
Ah, this is good. But J'zargo will know them first.
Ah! You've retrieved the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller.
All meats guaranteed clean and free from Rockjoint!
All right. But I am getting a bit tired of waiting.
Amazing! These must have been very hard to come by.
And we'll cleave through the Legion to get to them.
And when the truth finally dawns, it dawns in fire.
And you're right, at least as far as I'm concerned.
Arch-Mage or not, my rules about books still stand.
Are you ready to see the world as only a dovah can?
Are your ears still ringing? I hope that goes away.
As soon as we can muster our forces, we'll be back.
Aw, mama, I want to stay and talk with Uncle Ralof!
barking/panting happily (greeting someone he likes)
Be careful. We need to find out what happened here.
Beautiful baubles and gleaming gemstones over here!
Been a thorn in my side for the last few years now.
But enough of this. Such things are best forgotten.
But you're not done yet. And you could still die...
But... we could use the breathing space to regroup.
Calm yourself, Galmar. Save it for the battlefield.
Can't a man have a bit of privacy? Get out of here!
Choose your path and your journey will be complete.
Come in, come in! I was just about to take a break.
Come on now, watch the footwork. Keep your balance.
Come on, we can't stop now. We have to keep moving!
Cowards! Stealing a woman from her home! For shame!
Do what he says, Vex. This isn't helpin' right now.
Do what you have to do, I'm not giving up on Gleda.
Don't come near me! I don't want to get hurt again.
Don't rush ahead. This is a trap if I ever saw one.
Don't worry, my lord. I'm the very soul of caution.
Don't you have better things to do than disturb me?
Done. Now move along, before you get me in trouble.
Enough to make a significant difference in the war.
Every bit as sharp as what you'll find in Whiterun.
Exactly. Nobody even remembers our name these days.
Fancies himself a bard. He pays, so I let him stay.
Feel like doing a bit of shopping... the Guild way?
Find me if you're ever lookin' for some extra coin.
Fine, but this isn't over Madena. We'll talk again.
Fine. I'll just keep all this coin for myself then.
Fine. Leave me the elf. You may go with your books.
Frost took my husband years ago. He was a good man.
Generally posting information is need to know only.
Get out of our city, gray-skins! This is Nord land!
Give him a chance to speak. He's trying to help us.
Good. Report back to me when your task is complete.
Goods and wares of all kinds, and all can be yours!
Gormlaith! We're running out of time! The battle...
Have you decided to do the right thing, Dragonborn?
Have you met Torom? He's the best dog in the Reach.
Haven't seen you here before, egg brother. Welcome!
He takes after his father, and she takes after you.
He was cruel to her. He would beat her every night.
He... He gave me something just a little while ago.
Help out an old man here with some coin, would you?
Help yourself, by all means. Who cares if I starve?
Here you go... should fit you like a glove... boss.
Hey, weren't you on the carts with the Stormcloaks?
Hmph. Yes. Yes, I believe you are. Very well, then.
Hopefully, that story about Lenne's Shield is true.
How dare that little fool! And right under my nose!
How in the name of Akatosh... How do you have that?
How thoughtful! I'll come take a look after supper.
I almost can't believe it... a real, live dragon...
I am proud to have a mate to share in my blessings.
I asked what you thought of the Orcs, not about me.
I can't afford to get one, but can I afford not to?
I can't believe it! How did ya' talk her into this?
I can't believe my mother's gone. Now what'll I do?
I can't deny the man is right about a few things...
I can't express how much easier you've made my job.
I certainly hope so, otherwise I'm wasting my time.
I don't care much for the war one way or the other.
I don't like the looks of this place... not at all.
I don't remember seeing you at one of these before.
I feel like we're mining even more ore than before.
I guess we should have expected this response, hmm?
I hear the steward asked you to look into the fire.
I hope someday we'll get to know each other better.
I just can't wait to be a bride someday. Someday...
I knew he was telling the truth. I always can tell.
I know! I know! Just shut up and let me look, okay?
I need a Daedra's heart, at once! Quickly, quickly!
I need your help with something. Something private.
I see you still have the run of the place, traitor.
I see. Well, let me know if things get out of hand.
I stand where I have always stood. Here in Morthal.
I still don't see why we had to bring it back here.
I swear, if those things have laid a hand on her...
I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.
I think you and I are going to get along just fine.
I think you should continue with your performances.
I trust them completely, because I understand them.
I trust you know what you're doing with that spell?
I will be back at your house if you need me, Thane.
I would hope you recognize Aela, even in this form.
I, well, no of course not. I would be glad to help.
I'd be honored, but I have work to do in the mines.
I'll show you what I can about protecting yourself.
I'll teach you some of what I know, but be careful.
I'm fully aware of the terms of our... arrangement.
I'm happy to lend a hand as much as I can, as well.
I'm here to help you with books, Nirya. That's all.
I'm Riften's appointed Steward. How can I help you?
I'm sorry about Roggvir. It's a shame, I liked him.
I'm still not sure I understand what you're asking.
I'm the best at breaking up rocks. Thorgar says so.
I've got weapons for givin', and armor for gettin'!
I've taken the first steps toward doing so already.
If a man has time to complain, he has time to work.
If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
If you want to get paid, keep your weapon sheathed.
Important deliveries to make! No time for chatting!
Iron sword, huh? What are you killing, butterflies?
Is it true that you kill deer and eat their hearts?
Isn't there some business you should be tending to?
It is done. I won't go back to Avanchnzel. I won't.
It looks like you're ready to speak with the Augur.
It's alright Karliah. You don't have to say a word.
It's no wonder she fled in the middle of the night.
Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be.
Just let me out of here. I only wanted to help you!
Keep it to yourself. They're not paying us to talk.
Larak is strong, but he has much to prove as chief.
Let them do the work, that's what you pay them for!
Let Ulfric try to make it past our combined forces.
Let's get out of here before we end up like Mercer!
Let's go see if Esbern's right about Alduin's Wall.
Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor.
Look at you, begging on the streets. Learn a trade.
Look at you. Such a devoted student of Restoration.
Look how persistent you are. It's charming, really.
Look, I've told you everything. Now leave me alone!
Looking for the best smith in Skyrim? You found it.
Margret. He... he killed her. Right in front of me.
Master, you're not truly considering accepting her?
Master, you're not truly considering accepting him?
Mauhulakh. I remember him. Little, scrawny, fellow.
Murder. Banditry. Assault. Theft. And lollygagging.
My aunt died. Things won't be the same without her.
My goodness, how did you ever come by all of these?
My title is Harbinger, child. I am no man's master.
My wife died. Things won't be the same without her.
My wife Kerah runs our jewelry stall in the market.
My worthless husband is gone, so I run the inn now.
No, no... Maramal... we talked about this. Talen...
No, no... please, I'm just tired is all. Thank you.
No, not right now. Maybe later, if I'm still upset.
No. There are too many people around. Come with me.
Nobody believes me, but I tell you, I saw a dragon!
Not that I mind the break, of course. But, still...
Not well at all, and I'm happy to keep it that way.
Now all I need... wait, what were we talking about?
Now go. And give the bride a special kiss, from me.
Now I'm finally going to have some fun around here.
Now, as for your wish... An end to the war, was it?
Of course he does. What sort of a question is that?
Of course, the money is still good. And the drinks!
Of course! I.... I'm sorry. One giant's toe. There.
Of course! I've seen you at the Flagon. My mistake.
Of course. But if you need me, just give the order.
Oh my, how wonderful! Lady Mara will be so pleased!
Oh, all things in time, my boy. All things in time.
Oh, dear. Would you look at that? How embarrassing.
Oh, for the love of Mara, would you please just go?
Oh, forgive me, Thane. I didn't realize it was you.
Oh, I'd gladly sell it to you if you had the money.
Oh, thank the gods. Here, take this with my thanks.
Oh, yes? I wonder what that old busybody wants now.
Oh... not at the moment. Maybe later. Don't go far.
One more song, what say you? Yeah? All right, then!
Or perhaps there's something you'd like to confess?
Or will you merely fade from history, unremembered?
Or will your name be a curse to future generations?
Orc poisons are to be feared, if you wish to trade.
Papa doesn't like when I talk to customers, anyway.
Patience isn't exactly my strong suit, but alright.
Plan on burning everything down, do you? Damn fool.
Please... Delphine has been very worried about you.
Pull up a chair, my friend... this is quite a tale.
Ralof seems to like you. That's good enough for me.
Regrettably, I cannot reach your plane so directly.
Rest a spell! Can't work every minute of your life.
Return when the elf lies dead and it will be yours.
Shouldn't you be out ruining someone's special day?
So Madanach was behind those murders. Gods help us.
So you're interested in my potions and ingredients?
So, the prodigal murderer returns. And the Gourmet?
Some may call this junk. Me, I call them treasures.
Sometimes it pays to look in every nook and cranny.
Stay strong. The Eight willing, we'll win this war.
Strangers like you bring war. I've seen enough war.
Such a fine day, smell the air! Isn't it wonderful?
Sure, no problem. We'll find someone else to do it.
Talk to me again if you prove yourself to Brynjolf.
Talking peace with Ulfric? You must be an optimist.
Tell me as soon as you've given Camilla the letter.
That is what the Divines have planned for you, yes.
That Wisp Essence didn't help, but maybe this will.
That's better. Let's get on the road to Kynesgrove.
That's fine scale armor you've got on there. Shiny.
The air is so clear in Skyrim, one can see forever.
The Alik'r are not permitted within the city walls.
The bastards... somehow they managed to kill Skjor.
The cloying air in this place is almost unbearable.
The cold stone, the dampness... it suits me, Svana.
The glory of killing it is ours, if you're with me!
The Gourmet. Leave it to Titus to spare no expense.
The guards say no draugr have come out of the mine.
The Jarl has things under control. Don't you worry.
The power of Mzinchaleft is mine! Begone from here!
The Sanctuary must be purged of its invading filth!
The shrine of Namira is further inside. Keep going.
The wounds are deep, Vilod! I can't stop the blood.
These axes can chop a lot more than wood, you know.
These lazy Argonians better get their tails moving.
These poor souls... suffering in eternal servitude.
They call me Sapphire because I love to steal them.
They don't work now. Why should I waste more money?
They may be cowards, but I'm not. I'll go with you.
They're dead? But now everyone will think I did it!
Think carefully where your loyalties lie... sister.
This is an orphanage, not an inn. Begone from here.
This is the last hagraven between us and my mother!
Those are College of Winterhold robes, aren't they?
Travel great Skyrim, and Kynareth travels with you.
Turn back, traveler! Terror waits within this mist.
Unfortunate, but someone else will take care of it.
Unlike my husband Kleppr, I watch after our guests.
Use your skills, not your blade and you'll do fine.
Vald? Good side? I think you have the wrong person.
Very good. I'm sure the Jarl will be quite pleased.
Very well, then. If you'll just... get going now...
Very well. You, outsider, come here! I want a word.
We want compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.
We want compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.
We... we have to go back. We can't leave Girduin...
We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.
We've talked about composure, speed, and precision.
Welcome to the Pawned Prawn. What can I do for you?
Welcome, friend, to Calixto's House of Curiosities!
Well done. Not many enchanters could pull that off.
Well yes, of course you had to go and mention that.
Well, I did see something interesting not long ago.
Well, I guess that's good enough... let's be off...
Well, if you change your mind, you know what to do.
Well, perhaps it's time for some independent study.
Well, this is highly unusual. And very interesting.
Well, you were deep in your cups when you got here.
What about Ulfric? Did you ever hear back from him?
What are you waiting for? Let's get this over with.
What did I tell you about snooping around my wards?
What is it? Do you have one of the Razor fragments?
What sort of arrangement? I need to know the terms.
What, seriously? Come on, I thought that was funny!
What's the most dangerous beast you've ever killed?
Whatever happened to Ennodius? He just up and left.
When are you going to take me away from here Bolli?
Where's my head? I never even greeted you properly.
Why the drawn weapon? Is it contemplating violence?
Yeah, I figured it would be like that. Here you go.
Yeah. Uh, I know you hurt someone in town recently.
Yes, I could use someone to fetch something for me.
Yes, milady. Sorry, milday. They will be completed.
Yes, yes, as you've said, countless times before...
Yes, yes! I think we must be close to the entrance.
Yes. Vahzah. You speak true, Dovahkiin. Forgive me.
You - over here, quick. Before any of them show up!
You can use Nettlebane to retrieve some of its sap.
You don't look so tough. I'll bet I could take you.
You don't want to talk about it, or you don't know?
You have no knowledge of who you speak to. Go away.
You have to hold still or this isn't going to work.
You here to attack me? I'm ready for you this time.
You idiot. You came all the way down here for that?
You know what I miss the most right now? Fresh air.
You must be the new recruit. Welcome to the Legion.
You remind me of my cousin's cat. Killed that, too!
You set this chain of events in motion at Saarthal.
You should be more careful with your spell casting.
You should have listened. Guards! Help! Trespasser!
You should talk to Rustleif. Get some proper steel.
You should've stayed in your precious forests, elf!
You stupid cow. You don't know what you're missing.
You talk to Reldith yet? She's like a mother to me.
You think so? Let's see who the real woman is here.
You want your share, don't you? Here you are, love.
You will? Really? Well, okay, here's the situation.
You'll be so much easier to rob when you're dead...
You're crazy! How dare you make such an accusation!
You're not really supposed to... you know, be here.
You're the one saved the Fire Festival. I remember.
You've already taken care of it?  Thank you friend.
Your insults and provocations have gone far enough!
Your not winnin' points with me with that attitude.
Zok morokei! More souls to feed my master's hunger.
A coin or two for a veteran? It's not much to ask...
A hundred gold says I knock your hide to the ground.
A Light that could illuminate Skyrim and her people.
A strong drink will chase off that chill in the air.
A true Nord places loyalty and honor above all else.
Ah a few bottles of Spiced Wine should hit the spot.
Ah, good to see you again! How did that delivery go?
Ah, so it is not just dreams then. I have seen this.
Ah, steel plate. Now that's a solid choice of armor.
Ah, you have returned. How goes the task I gave you?
Ah, you must mean my little adventure on the ship...
Ah! An excellent suggestion. I'll do that one, then.
Ah. Ha ha! Come here, come here come here come here!
All hail the Dragonborn! Hail her with great praise!
All hail the Dragonborn! Hail him with great praise!
All right then, your secret ingredient's been added.
All right, all right. You're mean when you're sober.
All right, anythin' in particular strike your fancy?
All right, everyone. Let's be careful, but have fun!
All right, let's give this a try. Ready your ward...
And here you go... your payment, just as I promised.
And I have you to thank for it. I won't forget this.
And of course, we couldn't have done it without you.
And please accept this gift from my personal armory.
And what, you think that'll solve all your problems?
And why should I speak with you? You broke my heart.
And, as promised, here's my trade. Hope you like it.
At last! I have searched for this drum for 20 years.
Aye. I'm the headsman here in Solitude. It's my job.
Aye. Let us forget our sorrow in the fury of battle.
Bear fat in the hearth fire, if you believe Hroggar.
Begone. I have no wish to speak to anyone right now.
Besides, it will be good to see High Hrothgar again.
Break my stuff with that weapon, and I'll break you.
Breeches, gowns... clothes for any occasion, really.
Brynjolf and I found them like that. Mercer's doing.
But I never dreamed that I would even get to see it.
But why would you risk your life for me, a stranger?
But... no more than a handful of us remain, brother.
But... That doesn't mean there isn't more out there.
By the way, if you're looking for something to do...
Can you believe we're here? Saarthal, of all places.
Come, [QUOTE]Nightingale![QUOTE] Find me if you can!
Curse this chill! I should have dressed more warmly.
Death is but the time to sleep forever, in the Void.
Destined for the chopping block if I'm not mistaken.
Did you get that purchase agreement to Markarth yet?
Didn't you hear me? I said the keep is under attack!
Do you ever get a weird feeling about those sisters?
Do you prefer heedlessness to my luminous glory? Go!
Don't mind Bolund. He's young and gets riled easily.
Don't mind me. I'm perfectly insensible to the cold.
Don't worry, the Eight are watching over us. I hope.
Drop by and see us again if you're ever in the area.
Eldergleam's sanctuary grove is to the east of here.
Even good hammers warp metal if struck without care.
Eventually your curiosity will drive you back to me.
Excellent. Follow me to the targets and we'll begin.
Fine. I hope that dragon takes you all to Sovngarde.
Fine. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?
Fools! You will not hold me here any longer, Valdar!
Fresh fish sounds like just the thing today, Addvar.
Ful, losei Dovahkiin? Zu'u koraav nid nol dov do hi.
Galmar thinks we should double our men in the Reach.
Get back! Get back! We need to trap it, not kill it!
Get over to Riften. We're mounting our final attack!
Go ahead and call this dragon of yours. We're ready.
Go ahead. I'll follow your lead and watch your back.
Gold, silver. Gems, maybe? Only one way to find out!
Good evening. I'm Pantea Ateia, the Master Vocalist.
Good, good. It's honest work, son. No shame in that.
Ha! About time we got some more muscle in this city.
Hail, summoner. Conjure me up a warm bed, would you?
Haven't attacked each other yet. Good a sign as any.
He also has a fearsome control of Destruction magic.
He looks so... sweet. Go ahead. Have the first bite.
He's written all of the text in the Falmer language.
Her marriage band? Then there's hope - she was here!
Here you go, I think you'll find these quite useful.
Hey, Lod, how is the worst farmer in the hold doing?
Hey, you mix potions, right? Can you brew me an ale?
Hmm, looks like this is as far as the Imperials got.
Hmm. That... That didn't really do anything, did it?
Hold your thoughts 'til after we untangle this mess.
Horvutah med kodaav. Caught like a bear in a trap...
Hurry it up. I've got to get back before I'm missed.
I am always available should you need me, Arch-Mage.
I am so very happy for you. If not a bit... envious.
I believe King Olaf's verse will provide that proof.
I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.
I can't tell you. She might hear me. She's so close.
I catch you stealing anything, I'll break your neck.
I did, and I will. It's just tougher than I thought.
I don't know you. You in Riften lookin' for trouble?
I doubt any of us are coming back from this mission.
I get it. It's funny. It just might upset your wife.
I just...  can't take the pain. Not a second longer.
I know all the good spots! You don't stand a chance!
I moved here from Helgen after my family was killed.
I need someone to do that to someone. I'll even pay.
I never thought I'd see another friendly face again.
I suppose you want something for your trouble? Here.
I suppose you're right... they say it gets easier...
I think you'll do more than just fit in around here.
I told you, this is the whelp that Vilkas mentioned.
I trust you'll be finished with Fort Hraggstad soon?
I wonder what the ancient nords used this place for?
I would if I could, but I can barely make ends meet.
I... I have some thinking to do. Thank you for this.
I... it's true, isn't it? You really are Dragonborn.
I'd explain my research, but you'd just be confused.
I'm a growing boy. I need as much food as I can get.
I'm amazed you even bothered to show your face here.
I'm glad you were able to bring the Key back safely.
I'm going to find whoever did this, and when I do...
I'm going to need your help in the kitchen tomorrow.
I'm going to see if I can find some way out of here.
I'm here to lend my magic to the people of Dawnstar.
I'm sorry, I'm just... you're right. Let me explain.
I've never seen anything like this, in all my years.
I've ventured into quite a few Nord ruins in my day.
If I was threatening you, believe me, you'd know it.
If that's how you choose to end your life, so be it.
If you like mead so much, why not go live in Riften?
If you try to hurt me again, I may have to kill you.
If you'll excuse me, I really just want to get home.
If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way.
If you're looking for handouts, look somewhere else.
Ignore me all you want, you still aren't getting in.
In exchange for Riften, the jewel of Skyrim? Hardly.
In my day, we knew how to dispose of trash properly.
It annoys us. What does it want to take from us now?
It feels like a whole mountain of rock is above  us.
It is the power of old! The Voice of the Dragonborn!
It was a pleasure to talk to someone so interesting.
It's been so long since I tasted my own blood. Sour.
It's going to take forever to sift through all this.
It's time we had a real king. One of our own making.
Just remember I'm here if you rethink your decision.
Just visiting. I had some business here. That's all.
Just... get out of my face. I've got nothing to say.
Keep a song in your heart, and a blade in your boot.
Keep your eyes open for those Stormcloak dogs, yeah?
Knowing this, are you ready to undergo the ceremony?
Let me know if you find out anything about the fire.
Let me look.  This is a very exciting moment for me.
Let's go to the Tomb. We can do the cleansing there.
Let's see if we can't find an outfit that suits you.
Look, I don't want to get in another brawl with you.
Make it quick. I get enough delays from politicians.
Maybe you can find a way through somewhere above us.
Meet me then if you've still got the stomach for it.
Men who understand one another need not waste words.
Mikael, son. How about something with a bit o' kick?
Miss Stentor, watch your tongue in the Jarl's court!
Most folk won't go near it now for fear it's cursed.
Move quickly so we can have this over and done with.
Moving into her quarters was an interesting process.
My claws are sharp. My will to kill... unquenchable.
My husband. He was the blacksmith up at Castle Dour.
My lord, we should send troops to Riverwood at once.
My niece died. Things won't be the same without her.
My uncle died. Things won't be the same without him.
Need a few spare septims? I got the cure right here.
Niranye, I just have to know -- what is your secret?
No surprise they keep vermin around. Filthy squalor.
No, no, that's not what I'm interested in right now.
No, no. Well, sometimes, but that's not the problem.
No. Of course not. Just - don't let me down Cipius. 
Not entirely true, though not entirely false either.
Not excited, no. Some very bad things happened here.
Now let us see if you are willing and able to learn.
Now... This conversation never happened. Understood?
Of course I am. What do I look like, a tavern wench?
Of course you'll get a cut. We take care of our own.
Offer yourself up as a sacrifice while you're there.
Oh, great. I'm gonna get killed by a crazy wizard...
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is everything all right?
Oh, really? Well then... how can I make that happen?
Oh, well thank you. I'll try and read this if I can.
Okay. I need to get back to the palace soon, anyway.
Once you've found out anything, come straight to me.
One of you get in here! I could put all of you down!
Pick a man and put him down. We attack on my signal.
Please, ask him what she likes. It's my only chance.
Poisons can kill your enemies faster than any blade.
Proceed down the hall to the gate when you're ready.
Proventus. Bring me my pen. And the good parchment. 
Purchase something or leave. Those are your options.
Reason, reason, reason. Your kind and their reasons.
REC - no subtitles displayed; noise of evil laughter
Remember, you don't get paid until they're all dead.
Return Wuuthrad to Ysgramor. It should open the way.
Riches are a gate-opener around here. Head right in.
Settle your accounts with Vex, and then we can talk.
She's buried outside of town. That's where I'd look.
Show those thieves not to steal from Lucan Valerius!
Skilled, lethal and good-looking. Yep, it's a curse.
So I opened a shop to try and get by. Now, though...
So I'm finally seeing you with a smile on your face.
So unless you're here to dig, you don't belong here.
Something's wrong... Boss' been down there too long.
Sorry. Margret might be dead, but the room's rented.
Speak your mind, Bryling. You're among friends here.
Speak, if you have aught to say worth the listening.
Stendarr protect Falkreath until Skyrim's Sons rise.
Strike the targets as they appear. Breath and focus.
Take care of your armor, and it'll take care of you.
Takes coin to pay a fine. And you don't have enough.
Teeba-Ei is cold, but Teeba-Ei works hard as always.
Tell me, mother, does Malacath favor our stronghold?
Thank you, dear friend. You've given me back my son.
Thank you. May Arkay bless you. I won't forget this.
Thank you. Please, do not open it. It is... private.
That one with the saddle? How much are you offering?
That twisted jester will pay for what's he's done...
That's a shame. What's causing them all the trouble?
That's generous, Jala, but I am happy to pay my way.
That's quite an accusation. I assume you have proof?
The Blades have never followed that path, of course.
The cycle of retaliation may continue for some time.
The Gildergreen will bloom again. All thanks to you.
The men simply seek wisdom. Everything will be fine.
The shrine of Namira is beyond that door. Get ready.
The Stormcloaks are finding victory across the land.
The Temple of Divines is always open for worshipers.
The Thalmor know how to deal with Talos worshippers.
The Thalmor? By the Nine, it's worse than I thought.
The things you say are just an act to please mother.
The world's gone mad with sorcerers now, is that it?
Then put the thumbscrews on him and hit him... hard.
Then we have no choice. The Miasma must be released.
There's a cave. Animals or bandits inside, no doubt.
There's no chance anyone in authority approved this.
Therefore all that remains is to bestow it upon you.
These ruins are old, maybe a thousand years or more.
Think carefully where your loyalties lie... brother.
This is a magic duel. Ma-gic. You know, with spells.
This is the royal armor, lass. Maybe in a few years.
This is your last warning. Get out, or get arrested.
Tiny blades don't hurt enough. A sword needs weight.
Tolfdir normally looks after your little group, yes?
Ulfric was a true hero of Skyrim. He will be missed.
Urag can be very helpful. Just don't antagonize him.
Use Dragonrend, brothers! Bring him to swords-reach!
Use Dragonrend! It is the only chance to defeat him!
Walk always in the light, in these days of darkness.
Walk always in the light, or we will drag you to it.
We Argonians do the work the Nords don't want to do.
We couldn't have taken this city without you, ma'am.
We don't need no help from the Empire on that count.
We have to go out there before she disappears again.
We want compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.
We want compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.
We want compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.
We're going to need an army to clear out that crypt.
We've been looking for someone to join us in a hunt.
Well well. Another maggot to squash beneath my boot.
Well, then this should be no problem at all for you.
Well... all right. What exactly do you need to know?
What are we going to do? How do we save the College?
What brings you to Balimund today? Repair? Purchase?
What have I done, Listener? Has Cicero offended you?
What is it? I said I didn't wish to... be disturbed.
What? Why would the stranger attack innocent Cicero?
When the sons of Skyrim would spill their own blood.
Why do I always have to be the Elf? I don't want to!
Why so glum, my ugly friend? Did we run out of mead?
With a Voice wielding power of the ancient Nord art.
Wonderful. I'll write it out so you won't forget it.
Wouldn't it be something if we found a vein of gold?
Yell all you want. It's not going to change my mind.
Yes, actually. You look like you're lousy with gold.
Yes, but they'll come around eventually. You'll see.
Yes, but why do you fight? If not for me, what then?
You are a very brave woman. But I already knew that.
You are due more honor than some calls and feasting.
You are trying my patience, citizen. Back away. Now.
You can trample us underfoot but we will rise again!
You can't have the ring back! You made a commitment!
You got nothin' better to do than bother an old man?
You have chosen wisely. Lead on, and I shall follow.
You hear that? The others must have found something!
You keep your mouth shut, and I pay you. Handsomely.
You made that from the remains of a dragon? Amazing.
You make one move towards my skooma, and I shiv you.
You should leave. Skald gets upset around Imperials.
You think I need to send Hrongar a stronger message.
You want the Emperor? You'll have to get through us!
You were just going to prove that you're Dragonborn.
You were not invited here. You are not welcome here.
You will pay for stealing from me you eyeless freak!
You, though, I expect will prove far more malleable.
You'll have to make do with what we have, Proventus.
You're back from Bleak Falls. Did you find anything?
You're not short of guts, are you? What's your game?
You're someone who can get things done. I like that.
You're worth putting in the extra effort for, pooch.
You've already turned down a job that I had for you.
You've little time to glory in your accomplishments.
Youngest bard at the Bards College, at your service.
...s-sleeping? No! Burn the temple! Kill the priests!
...w...what happened? Wait! We're still under attack!
A Dreth never forgets a traitor. You'll pay for this!
A few bad apples spoil the bunch. You know how it is.
A good lumberjack is quiet, hard-working, and honest.
A new face. And a right ugly one at that. No offence.
A venison pie, maybe? With a nice cup of mulled mead?
Aeri's the boss. Should talk to her if you want work.
Ah, you want protection? I can get you what you need.
Ah! Picking on an old man? What did I ever do to you?
All for some old crown? It's a strange war all right.
All right. I'll fletch some more when I get the time.
All that remains now is to bestow the title upon you.
Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. Let's move out!
Although I fear the Jarl may not be easy to persuade.
An Amulet of Mara, you're looking for marriage, then?
An axe of great vengeance. Each fragment is precious.
And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, sir!
And please, let's just... Let's keep this between us.
And we've done as much as we can to prepare for that.
Anyone with a stout heart like yours is welcome here.
Apples, tomatoes, leeks and cabbages! Fresh and ripe!
Aringoth sold Goldenglow? What's that idiot thinking?
As always, the Empire's fine words are worth nothing!
Ask any fool around here, and get a different answer.
Atub! Meddlesome woman... You would help us? Help me?
Before you go, mortal. One final challenge. Ha ha ha.
Before you say anything, no, I am not from the Reach.
Bet I can reach the bottom of this flagon before you!
By the gods! I know this looks bad. Let me explain...
Can I have it?  It's worthless to you, but I can pay.
Can I interest you in some fine goods from Morrowind?
Can't talk long, got to keep my eyes open for Mercer.
Careful, now. Wouldn't want someone to get... burned.
Carry on men, my gratitude and blessings go with you!
Come to see Balimund perform miracles with steel, eh?
Come, child, I will tell you how to track a snow cat.
Damn right. Just like all true sons of Skyrim should.
Debts are debts. Either he pays them, or his kind do.
Delve to its limits, and Blackreach lies just beyond.
Do we have to? They'd never lift a finger to help us.
Do you ever find that you regret making this journey?
Do you remember the sun? Because you'll forget. Soon.
Do you think you could handle Vilkas in a real fight?
Don't even give it a second thought. Maybe next time.
Don't forget me next time you need herbs and potions.
Don't forget them who's less fortunate than yourself.
Don't make me wait too long. I get bored very easily.
Drem Yol Lok. Greetings, wunduniik. I am Paarthurnax.
Everyone needs work, right? I have good work for you.
Farengar can explain the situation better than I can.
Farewell, Gallus. Eyes open... walk with the shadows.
Fiend! You will not leave here alive! Guards! Guards!
Fihada, where did you learn how to make bows so well?
Fine, then wait here. This should only take a second.
First you murder my sister, then you massacre my men!
For now, give this [QUOTE]Ratway[QUOTE] a wide berth.
From my view, I don't think we'll find anything here.
Gems, potions, exotic ingredients... I have them all!
Get out of here. Get out of here and never come back!
Get over to Morthal. We're mounting our final attack!
Glad to see they picked the right person for the job.
Go on, get moving! I'll try and clear a path for you.
Gods, I can't run away from this. I have to stop her.
Good, good. Keep up the hard work. It'll all pay off.
Good. He will have fled to gather others of his kind.
Good. Then you will be ready for whatever lies ahead.
Good. You make sure the lug tips you when he gets it.
Got lots of things to take care of. What do you need?
Gotta have a sharp axe to cut through all that fat...
Guess we'll have two more mouths to feed for a while.
Ha, what a coward. Didn't even put up a proper fight.
Have a drink, rest your feet and stay a little while.
Have you come to gawk at me or is this a social call?
He wants the city this badly, he can fight me for it.
He... he tried to kill Margret. Right in front of me.
He's a lucky man to have such a beautiful young wife.
He's a stubborn oaf. I don't know what good it'll do.
He's been spending a lot of time at the graves again.
He's my cousin. Just give him another chance. Please.
He's off fighting the war, dear. For the Stormcloaks.
Here he comes! Find cover and make every arrow count!
Hey, I'm not done talking to you yet. Come back here!
Hey, where do you think you're going? Come back here.
Hm. Well, if you change your mind, come see me again.
Hmph. I should have known better than to ask a knave.
Hmph. Music tames the most savage beasts. Even Nords.
Hooray! Grelod the Kind is dead at last! We're saved!
How about an axe? Malacath smiles on the axe-wielder.
I better get back to cleaning the store. What a mess.
I can't let you do this, mother. You have to die now!
I could have sworn I heard something right behind us.
I don't care, but my ancestors do. You can't have it.
I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.
I have everything under control. Thanks for offering.
I have no idea what happened. Ancano did it, I think.
I have nothing to say to you. Just... leave me alone.
I hope that we have all come here in the spirit of...
I just don't understand what kind of a man does that.
I keep gazing into the pommel gem. Not a single flaw.
I knew you could be counted on. Do what must be done.
I like the loyalty of a dog. Not as fickle as a wolf.
I must have forgotten. I'll take care of it tomorrow.
I need dragon scales. And not just any dragon scales.
I promise to answer all of your questions. Follow me.
I sacrificed a lot here today for this plan of yours.
I see. If something does happen, you know where I am.
I stand witness to the courage of the soul before us.
I swear it rains like this every time I go to Riften.
I told you everything I know. What else did you want?
I was this close to catching that killer. I swear it.
I would hate to see our reputation further tarnished.
I'd like the fresh air better, but this isn't so bad.
I'll never have Master Nurelion's skill with potions.
I'll remain in this location until ordered otherwise.
I'm going to put those pelts you gave me to good use.
I'm just one of the miners. I don't want any trouble.
I'm not from here. I'm a sellsword. These are my men.
I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this isn't it.
I'm sorry. You don't have to tell me if you don't....
I'm the best warrior in Morthal, and that's no boast.
If he sees the meadery in this state, I'll be ruined.
If I were you, I'd keep my feet dry and stay up here.
If that doesn't interest you, feel free to walk away.
If they think you're Dragonborn, who are we to argue?
If we can't get back into the mine, our town is sunk.
If you cause problems, I'll have to ask you to leave.
If you go there, talk to Viarmo. He's the headmaster.
If you run into any Stormcloaks, kill a dozen for me.
If you're looking for a bed, this is the wrong place.
It shouldn't be. You'll be back to normal in no time.
It's a Dwarven Centurion. Very tough and very deadly.
It's a little more than a rebellion, don't you think?
It's just... I think our fighting styles are similar.
It's so good to have everyone around the table again.
It's tough, just scraping by out here. But I make do.
J'zargo is eager to hear how the scrolls are working.
Jarl Olaf One-Eye it was, who later became High King.
Just walk toward the chest! Gravity will do the rest.
Keep away. If I am harmed, people will come looking. 
Keep up the effort, boy. Eyes on the horizon, always.
Kill her. And make sure there's nothing left to bury.
Kill him. And make sure there's nothing left to bury.
Kill the damn dragon! Unless you have a better idea?!
Let those that watch from Sovngarde envy us this day!
Let's make sure that overgrown lizard is really dead.
Let's show these rebels what real soldiers look like.
Listener. I am your only salvation. Come. Embrace me.
Look to the graveyard. That is where you'll find her.
Looks like someone's been digging here. And recently.
Men are utter pigs... they only care about one thing.
Morthal has enough problems without you bothering me.
Murbul knows many poisons and cures if you need them.
My cousin died. Things won't be the same without her.
My cousin died. Things won't be the same without him.
My father died. Things won't be the same without him.
My friend died. Things won't be the same without her.
My friend died. Things won't be the same without him.
My good pleasure is not some trophy for mortal sport!
My mother died. Things won't be the same without her.
My nephew died. Things won't be the same without him.
My sister died. Things won't be the same without her.
Name's Rune. Yeah, rune... just like you're thinking.
Nice to meet the person who went to King Olaf's Tomb.
No. We will deal with Alduin ourselves, here and now.
None? Nothing at all? Nothing from the College, even?
Nord beast! Both your life and lands are now forfeit!
Not the response I was hoping for, but suit yourself.
Now go give those stupid bears what's coming to them!
Now Loreius. Loreius has learned the meaning of ugly.
Now more than ever, the world needs tales of heroism.
Now that's impressive. You're mightier than you look.
Oblivion take them. Every miserable last one of them.
Of course. Skyrim has always been part of the Empire.
Oh yes. You've got to kill the bride. At her wedding.
Oh, a big doggy chasing a little kitty! How adorable!
Oh! Well in that case, lead on. I'm right behind you.
Oh. J'zargo takes this to mean it did not go... well.
On this glorious day, we honor everyone! Ha ha ha ha!
Once the Oath has been struck, the terms are binding.
One day, you will serve our Dread Father as I do now.
One moment. But don't go far. I expect I'll need you.
Only the best in all of Riften! I own Riften Fishery.
Papa told you to do that, not me! Now leave me alone!
Perhaps we should take a look inside these coffins...
Perhaps you'd be willing to assist me in that regard?
Probably got drunk and fell into the lake. Who cares.
Rare trinkets and the finest oddities from Morrowind!
Remember always this: As you will it, so it shall be.
Remember, we have proof and all he's got is his word.
Savos is right. We can make it if we just stay alert.
See if you can find anything in the burned out house.
See to that, and I'll tell you what you want to know.
She is the bearer of love and the patron of marriage.
Skyrim is filled with all manner of dangerous beasts.
So Sibbi finally got the nerve to bare his teeth, eh?
So this is what we heard. The entire tower collapsed.
So you're the one that burned down Goldenglow Estate.
Speak to Falk when you have the funds. And thank you.
Speak with Ulfric, he's expecting word from Whiterun.
Stay guarded. You never know what could be out there.
Sure, but I bet he can't hold his mead as well as me!
Take great care, and know that the Order is watching.
Thank you, thank you. No, please, hold your applause.
Thank you. That bastard got exactly what he deserved.
Thanks. I only wish Lucan was here to see this again.
That's it! I'm not retiring, ever! End of discussion!
The Companions let me fight for gold, and so I fight.
The fairest prices and the highest quality in Skyrim!
The Hag's Cure is here for all your discreet needs...
The Thalmor? Do you have any idea what you're asking?
The trouble is that I can't seem to speak around her.
The two of us, living together. I'll see you at home!
These are troubled times. Be on your guard out there.
These caves... they harbor ill omens, I can sense it.
They aren't my boys. Do I look like the leadin' type?
They call themselves the [QUOTE]Blood Horkers.[QUOTE]
They say dragons are coming back. I want to kill one!
This how you get your thrills? Feeling up an old man?
This is how you repay our trust? Paarthurnax's trust?
This is it. Riften, jewel of Skyrim. End of the road.
This is Markarth, traveler. Safest city in the Reach.
This isn't about religion, Brynjolf... it's business.
This war's as stupid as our feud with Clan Gray-Mane.
Those awful Thalmor can't touch us, thanks to Ulfric.
Ummm... they'd lock me up if I went around like that.
Unless we have specific business, I'm not interested.
Was is that obvious? Damn. I must be losing my touch.
Watch your step in here. The stonework gets slippery.
We believe the place in our vision to be Karthwasten.
We bring honor and glory to ourselves and each other.
We have angered Malacath, and so we must be punished.
We have to move. We'll talk more once we see the sky.
We must gather our strength. Who knows what's inside?
We want compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.
We want compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.
We want compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.
We will now see how you learn a completely new Shout.
We're not leaving here until we get what we came for.
Welcome to Belethor's General Goods. Welcome, indeed.
Welcome to Solitude. Home of the arts here in Skyrim.
Well, I suppose I needn't wonder where he is anymore.
Well, I suppose if that means what I think it does...
Well, if some Moon Sugar should fall into your lap...
Well, if you don't want to hear it, that's your loss.
Well, the men will be expecting some kind of speech. 
Well? Spit it out, mortal. I haven't got an eternity!
What do you expect to find? My juggling balls? He he.
What do you say, Irileth? You're being awfully quiet.
What do you want? You have no business being in here!
What do you want? You have no business being in here.
What I lack in strength, I make up for with tenacity.
What is this? The elf playing at treachery? Shocking.
What of it? It's our Inn, and they cause him no harm.
Where did you learn of a Shout used to defeat Alduin?
Who do you think's killed more Imperials? You? Or me?
Why thank, you... you're very kind. Still interested?
With any luck, this will be Mercer's final day alive.
Worthless. Everyone like you is completely worthless.
Yes, and I'm working on it, but I'm also trying to...
Yes, and we have something special for you this time.
Yes, Listener. I won't move unless you give the word.
Yes, that's it. The symbol on the pillar on the left.
Yes. I'm your friend, and I've invited you to dinner.
Yes. My older brother. He was a bit of a fop, really.
You again? We have nothing else to discuss. Now move.
You could learn Dragonrend from those who created it.
You get me a heart, I get you some armor. Interested?
You just sit tight. I'll get around to it eventually.
You kiddin'? My brother Dirge works in their hideout.
You know you're not supposed to be in here right now.
You know, I'll pay you to attack one of my enemies...
You might consider putting on... something. Anything.
You must be all right if you've got time to complain.
You must be the one Falk spoke so highly of. Welcome.
You must speak with the Farmhand at Chillfurrow farm.
You really don't want to be loitering here, stranger.
You should not have meddled in the Thalmor's affairs.
You there. I don't think I've seen you around before.
You think I need to send Balgruuf a stronger message.
You want to fight? That why you have your weapon out?
You want to talk to me? After everything you've done?
You were right about this place. And about Mauhulakh.
You work hard, Daighre. Glad you have stayed with us.
You wouldn't understand, Housecarl. You ain't a Nord.
You. I've seen you snooping around. Asking questions.
You. You must take the Lexicon. Free me of my burden.
You're a liar! I won't listen to you. Leave me alone!
You're needed in Hjaalmarch. There's much to be done.
You're too kind. Thank you. Be careful and stay safe.
You've been at it for five minutes. Here, let me try.
You've got people to kill, my friend. Best get to it.
Your loss, but if you change your mind, I'll be here.
'Bout time. Brynjolf's been gettin' on me about money.
A gift, Dovahkiin. Shul. Understand Sun as the dov do.
A gift, Dovahkiin. Yol. Understand Fire as the dov do.
A good story is nine parts truth and one part fiction.
A hard truth, that is. Let's drink to the fallen ones.
A sharp mind on you. We should find out for ourselves.
Ah well. I'll keep looking for someone. Thanks anyway.
Ah, at last. I've been anxiously awaiting your return.
Ah, fresh blood. Hope you know how to handle yourself.
Ahh, going for the mysterious and brooding thing, hmm?
All right, we've all seen enough. Put on some clothes.
Also, I doubt you'd be able to comprehend the details.
And it's clear money matters more to Dagur than honor.
And my Aunt wouldn't have to worry about her daughter.
And now you pay for meddling in the Thalmor's affairs.
And take this. A gift from the Jarl's personal stores.
Anything else you need before you head back to Riften?
Are you a soldier? One day, I'm going to be a soldier!
Are you looking to join? I wouldn't get your hopes up.
Arrogant, eh? Play it however you want, but listen up.
As high priest of the Nine Divines, I bid you welcome.
At least the Nords don't shirk their responsibilities.
Azura? Gods, it's all finally coming back to haunt me.
Be quick. I have little patience for mundane concerns.
Begone, mage. Do not test my promise to the Dovahkiin.
Brand-Shei, do you think you can find me some theilul?
But I had to know if the rumors about you were true...
But it never hurts to be a little suspicious, does it?
But never mind all that. What brings you out this way?
But now Alva takes care of me. And I take care of her.
But the people I asked say no one enters or leaves....
By Ysgramor's axe! It's true. Morthal owes you a debt.
Can't sleep well no matter how much drink I put in me.
Certainly! Glad to see you have the task well at hand.
Come on, father. There's nothing more to be said here.
Couldn't have done it better myself. Here's your coin.
Death? Oh, there's death to be found here, to be sure.
Did he now? The man is persistent, I'll give him that.
Did you look behind the forge? I think I saw it there.
Do whatever you're going to do before it kills us all!
Do you think Tekla has been talking to Siddgeir again?
Doesn't matter. I'm sure he's long gone by now anyway.
Don't even bother with that one. Leave it to the orcs.
Don't forget us if you need supplies for your journey.
Don't know anyone here doesn't have Rattles or Ataxia.
Don't worry, I'll come to this peace council of yours.
Enjoy this while you can. Soon you will all be slaves.
Even if you're one of us, you better not make trouble.
Fair enough. But are you willing to die for your home?
Farengar, I see you've already met my new friend here.
Finally, someone around here that can get things done.
Fine armor you've got there. Dwarven make, am I right?
Fine, Ataf. You should eat some more tomatoes, though.
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows.
For Ulfric? Oh, nothing official. Known him for years.
Fresh meats and produce! Get them before they're gone!
Gallus trusted her too much and let her get too close.
Get over to Dawnstar. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Markarth. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Whiterun. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Windhelm. Tell Ulfric of our victory here.
Get over to Windhelm. We're mounting our final attack!
Ghorza is the one you should ask if you need anything.
Glad you were here. Couldn't have done it without you!
Go now, with haste. Take my beacon to Mount Kilkreath.
Go talk to the Greybeards, see what they can tell you.
Good to see you in my museum again. I owe you my life.
Good work. The mindless cretins didn't stand a chance.
Good, these will make wonderful settings for my rings.
Good. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for your return.
Got nothing to spare for travelers nor refugees, here.
Have any skooma? I need to get something from Grisvar.
Have you no thought beyond the blooding of your blade?
Have you prepared the stables like I suggested, Shadr?
He didn't want to hit the bar like the rest! Ha ha ha!
Hear that? Stormcloaks. Maybe we can reason with them.
Hello, my dear. I got your message. Where shall we go?
Hm. You're not from around here. Imperial spy perhaps?
Hmph. Looks like we got a cutthroat skulkin' around...
Hold a moment, Rune. What did you think about my idea?
Hold your tongue, Wizard, or you're likely to lose it.
I can always find time to share a word with a warrior.
I can't believe it! Grelod is dead! She's really dead!
I can't believe you did that. You people are monsters!
I don't need to know if it's fresh from this distance.
I don't think we have anything to discuss, Stormcloak.
I have given my answer. Go and reconsider your course.
I hope you're finding the city in proper order, thane.
I know the prophecy by heart. Once all Blades knew it.
I may be dark elf by birth, but I was raised Argonian.
I need some more supplies. Can you help out with that?
I raised my Sven to be strong, and proud. A true Nord.
I see everything, hear everything and know everything.
I see that mortals have become arrogant while I slept.
I sell all sorts of poisons for almost every occasion.
I should get back to work. Money doesn't count itself.
I suppose that's a benefit to having so few customers.
I suppose that's the fairest deal we're likely to get.
I think I have some more of these padding my mattress.
I think the College is due for a change in leadership.
I think you'll find this payment to be more than fair.
I try to think of it as coaxing the ore from the rock.
I want you to explain to them the error of their ways.
I wanted to give you this. A token of my appreciation.
I was sent here because someone said I was a Forsworn.
I wish Galmar would hurry it up. We shouldn't be here.
I wish I didn't have to. It's quite a difficult climb.
I wonder if we should offer discounts to the soldiers.
I worry that you've been spending too many nights out.
I would be honored for you to accompany me, Harbinger.
I would not complain if you returned with some Skooma.
I... I think I need to be done talking for the moment.
I'll be the judge of that. Now, back to your practice.
I'll do you ten gold at three to one on the white one.
I'll pay to do the same, to a certain special someone.
I'll pay you to figure it, whether or not he's guilty.
I'm also free to stay and fight for what I believe in.
I'm always trying to find more of Shalidor's writings.
I'm just trying to have a quiet drink here, all right?
I'm sorry, but that's as far as my generosity extends.
I'm sorry, I was under the impression I was in charge.
I'm sorry. At least you'll die here, in your homeland.
I'm worried about Idgrod, and I don't know what to do.
I've got a little work if you're interested, traveler.
I've taken over the Hag's Cure, since Bothela is gone.
If that weapon breaks anything, you will be buying it.
If that's what she wants, then that's what she'll get.
If there's anything you need, I'd be glad to help you.
If you can bring me three more, that would be helpful.
If you need any more smithing work, come see me again.
If you think there's anything you can do, be my guest.
If you'll excuse me, I have other things to attend to.
Igmund, we need to talk about the Silver-Blood family.
In the ancient tongue, you are Dovahkiin - Dragonborn!
Is it that obvious? Sigh. I've got my hands full here.
Is that so? I've been wondering when he'd come around.
Is there anything new I should be aware of, Mirabelle?
It seems like Dorthe grows a head taller every season.
It's an honor to see you, the keeper of Namira's ring.
It's too bad they executed Roggvir before we got here.
Karliah's taught you nothing! Your lessons begin anew!
Leave me to my work. Unless you plan to stay and help?
Listen up. Those Imperials aren't here by coincidence.
Look. Perhaps we could come to some kind of agreement?
M'aiq is very practical. He has no need for mysticism.
Maybe I'll do turnips next. Hmmm... Or maybe radishes?
Maybe we should turn back. I don't want to sleep here.
Much obliged. Here. It's not much, but take it anyway.
My brother died. Things won't be the same without him.
My husband died. Things won't be the same without him.
My Jarl, I have concerns about the safety of Dawnstar.
My kinsman died. Things won't be the same without him.
My mind is on my experiments today. What did you need?
Never mind, it doesn't matter. You need to leave. Now.
No more.... No more.... I submit, Molag Bal. I submit!
No. I cannot teach it to you because I do not know it.
No. I will have no peace until these hunters are dead.
No. You insult us by bringing her to this negotiation?
Not just any dragon scales. Heartscales. Very special.
Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Word.
Now, let's see. What shall we have the rest of you do?
Now, since our transaction is done, I'll be on my way.
Oh my. He... he wanted me to think Faendal wrote this?
Oh thank goodness! I wasn't sure where else to turn...
Oh, Beem-Ja. I never meant for this. What have I done?
Oh, hi, I'm glad I ran into you. I was wondering if...
Oh, if you haven't heard Dean Pantea sing, you should.
Ondolemar is the commander of the Thalmor in Markarth.
Only then will I take my rightful place as High Queen.
Ooohh.... how decadent. I never would have guessed it.
Or, you can just wait here. He'll be back soon enough.
Our sisterhood will be better off with you dead, brat.
Please, anything you can do to help find my Thorald...
Please, follow me. I'll escort you inside the College.
Please. I don't want to talk about it. All that blood.
Praise Kynareth for allowing such beauty in the world.
Rather not talk. I have to head back to Cyrodiil soon.
Regardless. It appears Skyrim must stand alone. Again.
Remember, I'll give you the best deals, or die trying.
Riften and thieves means trouble. Just leave it alone.
Riften's under my protection. You watch yourself, now.
Right now I've got a book that I think you might like.
Scholars from around the world will come here one day.
She did, did she? She's going to get a sit down later.
She influences our luck and in return demands payment.
Sir, there continues to be unrest in the Gray Quarter.
Skald is very... vocal about his hatred of the Empire.
So Delphine keeps up the fight, after all these years.
So have you spoken to that man from the Bards College?
So we scrounge whatever we can from around the tundra.
So, Roggi, when are you going to get yourself a woman?
So, you're the one. Hmm. You don't look so impressive.
So... Northwatch Keep. Then we know where to hit them.
Something I can help with or do you just want to talk?
Soon it will be time to replenish our supply of water.
Sorry, I need to pay attention so I can remember this.
Sorry... I usually have a nose for this kind of thing.
Spare a coin for a fellow Nord who's down on his luck?
Speak with General Tullius. He'll administer the oath.
Steady! Steady, now! Keep under cover until it's down!
Still learning the ropes, but I'll get the hang of it.
Suffice to say that our Sybil was recently lost to us.
Thank you for the blessing, I'll put this to good use.
Thanks a lot! Here. Take this. For all your hard work.
That may be so. This is Vilkas. He will test your arm.
That's a real shame. You would've fit the bill nicely.
That's better. Now scurry off, my little guttersnipes.
That's okay. We'll find a way to get by. Safe travels.
The bitter war of the world beyond was all for naught.
The Divines smile on those who show mercy an' charity.
The fever's down a bit, an' I can almost see straight.
The Legion could sure use someone like you. Good luck.
The metal has been stubborn today. It refuses to bend.
The number of graves in this cemetery never decreases.
The Silver-Bloods pay their debts. You have my thanks.
The suffering the Daedra cause will not go unpunished.
Their aim could be steadier, but they're battle ready.
There may be no enemy more foul than a walking corpse.
There's a likely-looking filly. Even if she is an elf.
These graves hold the sons and daughters of Falkreath.
These jobs aren't going to finish themselves you know.
They haven't allowed necromancy for hundreds of years!
They're masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting.
Think you can mess with an Orc of the Reach? Let's go.
This is where we saw Mercer. We must be getting close.
This land's tough and unforgiving, but beautiful, too.
This projection should be lit up like the night sky...
This stronghold respects strength, and strength alone.
Time to prepare some more records on the silver trade.
Too confusing for me. Empire, Nords, Talos. Who cares?
Tools, wares and weapons, all for sale at fair prices.
Treat my people fairly, and I will do the same to you.
Trust in Mara... she'll protect us in this dark place.
Uch. Been tending your hounds? You smell like wet dog.
Unless, of course, you'd like to make some extra gold.
Very well. Come for me, then. Come and let's end this!
We can talk about that once this dragon is dealt with.
We cannot go after her, not without drawing attention.
We hurt them in the past, and they have long memories.
We showed those Imperials what real Nords are made of!
We want compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.
We want compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.
We want compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.
We want compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.
We'll meet back up at the Sanctuary! I'll be fine. Go!
Well now, there's a name I haven't heard in some time.
Well that's just it. Some of them might not be sacred.
Well yes, I did. And thank you so much for helping me.
Were there tears? I hope everyone can see the bruises.
What are you doing here? What've you done with Gavros?
What are you doing? We need to get out of Helgen. Now!
What are you, some kind of tease? Stendarr's Mercy....
What do you want, Imperial? Ain't my life hard enough?
What more do you need that Yatul and I cannot provide?
What? Get over with the rest of the men at Korvanjund.
What's the matter with you? You want to start a blaze?
What's the matter, afraid of getting your hands dirty?
When I ask you for something, I expect it to get done.
Where I belong is back aboard my ship, on the Abecean.
Why are my research materials constantly disappearing?
Why should I hide from it? This is my family's legacy!
Why struggle? The Thalmor will only send more like me.
Without them at our backs, we'd be in serious trouble.
Wonder if any of my ancestors ever walked these halls?
Yes, and just like weeds, they're nothin' but trouble.
Yes, Lady Ateia. My voice is strong as a Dragonborn's!
Yes, that's it. The symbol on the pillar on the right.
You better get proof of your accusations against Alva.
You call yourself a wizard? I challenge you to a duel!
You did it! All four targets in ten seconds. Nice job.
You fool, why should I share the treasure with anyone?
You have committed a breach, and must pay the penalty.
You heard me, captain- our work must not be disturbed.
You here to see the Jarl? No sudden moves, understand?
You just going to stand there and take it? Fight back.
You look strong. Come to Jorrvaskr and be a Companion!
You must be lost. The tavern is down the road a piece.
You picked a bad time to come home to Skyrim, kinsman.
You still have one of the witch's heads. This is good.
You trying to hide? 'Cause I can see you plain as day.
You want a cut of venison or mutton? Of course you do.
You, talk to egg-brothers. Deeja has no words for you.
You'd do well to remember who's in charge around here.
You're a good friend. Here. Take this. You'll like it.
You're back! Great! Are we going on another adventure?
You're making my patrons nervous. Put the weapon away.
You're not from here, and we don't need to be talking.
You're not one of my workers. What are you doing here?
You've been a good friend to me. That means something.
Your own fate will be your own choice. Just as always.
A solid gold ornament, in the shape of a dragon's claw.
Aav uv dir. Join me or perish with your mortal friends.
Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Are you new here?
Ah, pardon me, friend. I didn't see you standing there.
Ah, there you are. I've been waiting for you to arrive.
Ah, you're from the College? I've been waiting for you.
Ainethach is dead. What will happen to Karthwasten now?
Alduin, thuri! Boaan tiid vokriiha suleyksejun kruziik?
All right. Head to the pit when you think you're ready.
And so the Empire runs roughshod over Skyrim, as usual.
And that you knew where to get more. Let's go find one!
Are you feeling all right, dear? You look a little ill.
Arkay keeps the cycle. He watches us in life and death.
As high priest of the Eight Divines, I bid you welcome.
As long as the College keeps paying, I'll keep digging.
As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open the door.
As you will, my Thane. I will protect you with my life.
At least we got the damn crown. I hope it was worth it.
Aye, there will be blood today. I can promise you that.
Because killing her would yield no political advantage.
Black Briar Mead? What are you trying to do? Poison me?
Blast. Well, I'll check my sources and speak to Mercer.
Blessings of the Nine Divines upon you. How may I help?
Bring it to me, and we'll talk about Goldenglow Estate.
Bring Verulus here. The Lady of Decay will do the rest.
But first... find my husband. Make sure he's all right.
But we haven't taken a side because it's not our fight.
But what's all this about? What are you two doing here?
But what's this all about? What are you two doing here?
But, never mind all that. What brings you out this way?
By the Nine, I hate the waiting. The goddamned waiting.
Can't have a meal without meat. Come and get some here.
Can't imagine what the College expects to find in here.
Captain Lonely-Gale, it's always a pleasure to see you.
Carriages to all the cities in Skyrim. Don't forget us.
City of Markarth sure is a beauty. No doubt about that.
Come back to gloat? I've been beaten by worse than you.
Come on, boys. Let's spread out and see what we've got.
Come on! Before the dragon brings down the whole tower!
Come on. We need to find out what's happening up there!
Considering most of us are now dead, I assumed as much.
Do I have your permission to uncork the Arenthia red...
Does he have information about our wonderful discovery?
Does his strength have no end? Is our struggle in vain?
Does this mean... is it done? Is Alduin truly defeated?
Don't be late, you don't want to miss your own wedding!
Don't get involved in that nonsense. Just want to work.
Don't play stupid. I said turn out your pockets... now!
Drink Honningbrew Mead with a wench on each arm? Ha ha!
Enough with the training. I want to go fight something.
Even the dead need company. That's what Arkay provides.
Ever tried making your own? It's... not easy. Trust me.
Falkreath's warriors always return, one way or another.
Fine work. Here's your pay. Don't spend it all on mead.
Fine! I'll take care of it, just please leave me alone!
Follow me. I think I can convince the tree to help us. 
Get me mad, and I'll prank ya. And not a little. A lot.
Get over to Falkreath. We're mounting our final attack!
Go ahead. Whatever you want to know. Nothing held back.
Good job. I knew you'd come back with something for me.
Good luck. If you get a chance, look me up in Solitude.
Good, and take this little message back to your bosses.
Got someone I want you to hurt. Don't worry, I can pay.
Hard to say. The weather's taken a bit of a turn, here.
Have a look around. I buy and sell just about anything.
He lives in seclusion on the very peak of the mountain.
He'll be fine, I just hate worrying about his worrying.
He's in the inn. Look around. I'm sure you'll find him.
Healing magic? An Orc lets her wounds heal naturally...
Heard you had a bit of trouble near Solitude last week.
Hello, friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?
Here. I want you to have this. Don't ask. Just take it.
Here's another septim, Madesi. How much more do I need?
Here's your gold. Try not to spend it all in one place.
Hey Ton, you shouldn't cheat on Vekel. He's a good guy.
How much longer do we have to work this backwoods mine?
Hows about we figure out some way to keep warm tonight?
I am at the Arch-Mage's disposal if he requires advice.
I am close, so close! You must force him to see reason!
I believe Galmar gave you something to do. So go do it.
I believe Sanguine would be pleased with this festival.
I bet we have rabbit again. I'm getting sick of rabbit.
I call forth that power! Accept the soul that we offer!
I can't allow you to destroy the Skull, Priest of Mara.
I can't go near his body. Would you get it back for me?
I cannot teach you the Shout, because I do not know it.
I do, but some folk here think he set the fire himself.
I don't even want to know what it is you've been doing.
I don't want to settle. I like things the way they are.
I find it hard to believe this excavation was approved.
I find your hand in my pocket, I'm going to cut it off.
I guess I shouldn't boast so much... it gets expensive!
I guess Lucan will never see the golden claw again now.
I guess we're lucky that didn't come down on top of us.
I have faith that you'll return with King Olaf's Verse.
I hope that you will come to do business with us again.
I just wanted a little excitement. Something dangerous.
I must have misheard you. Did you say you were leaving?
I need you to pitch in a little more around here, dear.
I no longer use that name. I'm Erandur, Priest of Mara.
I see. Well, let's continue this discussion later then.
I should have guessed Ulfric would be mixed up in this.
I suppose I'm not left much choice in the matter, am I?
I think I would, if it weren't for my son. And my wife.
I think my voice is ready. I hope we've done this well.
I used to work at Anga's Mill, but I... I had to leave.
I was actually just wondering if you had any family....
I was beginning to lose faith that any help would come.
I work for the Windpeak Inn. You should head on inside.
I would suggest that you not further spread this rumor.
I wouldn't go out there for all the money in the world.
I... I swear I felt something rather strange just then.
I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your hands to yourself.
I'll give you a week before you end up dead in a ditch.
I'm afraid I don't have a primary contract for you yet.
I'm beginning to think leaving Mournhold was a mistake.
I'm bored, Benor. Nobody wants to have any fun with me.
I'm glad we're friends. I have something for you. Here.
I'm going back to Narzulbur. Want to see how it's come.
I'm impressed at your even-handed treatment. Thank you.
I'm not sure I'm the best one to go through his things.
I'm one of miners. Plenty of ore to dig up around here.
I'm pretty sure I killed more than you. I was counting.
I'm quite pleased that we're back to business as usual.
I'm sorry for doubting you, friend. You have my thanks.
I'm sorry to be such a bother. We'll talk another time.
I'm still sore where I took that arrow. I hate archers.
I'm still waiting for those notes, if you can get them.
I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years.
I've been noting a pattern to when the killings happen.
I've been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.
I've mastered the shadows... and now your life is mine!
I've started seeing the Companions as a kind of family.
If only my mother would let me, I would make her proud.
If someone found her, she would make an excellent mate.
If you have a moment, could you help me with something?
If you have come to see our wares, speak to the others.
If you need potions, head over to Angeline's Aromatics.
If you need potions, you should try Arcadia's Cauldron.
Is it true? One of the Psijics was here in the College?
It don't matter now. None of it does. Just leave me be.
It is time he is replaced - in the traditional fashion.
It pains me to see that the whispers had truth to them.
It's been a hard day cleaning. Good, honest work I say.
It's wise to carry a few summoning enchantments around.
J'zargo knows that you will save the College. You must.
Just get away from me. We've got nothing left to steal.
Just in time. I was worried I'd have to do this myself.
Khajiit is always watching for thieves and pickpockets.
Kodlak advises them, but he doesn't really give orders.
Leave me alone. Haven't you done enough damage already?
Less coin in everyone's pocket means less coin in mine.
Let me know when you've learned more about the pirates.
Look around all you want, but don't try anything funny.
Look at the sky. Be a terrible day tomorrow. I know it.
Looks like you're a little short on coin though. Sorry.
M'aiq saw a mudcrab the other day. Horrible creatures. 
Magic is seen as something for elves, and weaker races.
Markarth has changed, but the inn is as lively as ever.
Master, I have a question about infusions of arrowroot.
Maybe you could buy a gift for a friend? A best friend?
Maybe you could help find it, I just know it's in here.
Mercer took everything. Even all of our plans are gone.
Morthal is full of cowards! Let's go kill that monster.
Mother tells me to shape metal with focus and strength.
My daughter died. Things won't be the same without her.
My father taught me an important lesson many years ago.
My patron appears once more. Have you need of my blade?
My shouting Torygg to the ground proved he had neither.
Never much cared for Windhelm. The place is depressing.
Never you mind, then. I'll find a more charitable soul.
Next, you'll have to... Are you still paying attention?
No matter how much the Stormcloaks may wish it were so.
No thank you. I'm still feeling sick from the festival.
No, child! Wait! That boy, that house - they're cursed.
No, nor do I expect to. Would be too dangerous for now.
No. And I'm not sure I'm better off for it now neither.
No. I don't have anything for bad dreams, so don't ask.
None of 'em's older than nine, and the youngest is six.
Not too bad. Careful around the more obvious scorchers.
Not yet... wait until Brynjolf's finished the ceremony.
Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Shout.
Now, did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?
Now, let us put this behind us and speak of it no more.
Now, let us turn our thoughts to more pleasant matters.
Oh, good. I wanted to try that out as soon as possible.
Oh, most certainly. At least, when Elisif herself asks.
Oh! Well if you change your mind, come back and see me.
Old Delvin certainly takes care of his own, doesn't he.
Old dwarven ruin. Look at that metalwork. Such a waste.
Onmund gave up the first time I said no. But not you...
Ooooh, an observant one. How clever to ask of Septimus.
Patience. Give me a moment and I'll explain everything.
Perhaps not the brightest spot in Skyrim's history, eh?
Perhaps you're right. But then what does that make you?
Please don't kill Constance Michel. She really is kind.
Please don't mind Joric. He's not mad, really he's not.
Please, come with me. I need to speak to you privately.
Please, just go check it out. You'll be saving my life.
Razelan. And you promised to behave yourself this time.
Ready to listen to the Silver-Blood family now, Igmund?
Release me, and I'll share a bit of my wealth with you.
Remember the Winking Skeever next time you're footsore.
Remember, fresh fruit and vegetables every day. Mostly.
Rhiada, did you clean the tables today? They're filthy!
Right you are! Guess I'll keep training you... for now.
Roggvir. He opened a gate and they executed him for it.
She wants the city this badly, she can fight me for it.
Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. At your service.
Show this new blood where the rest of the whelps sleep.
Show those marauders what Windhelm justice tastes like.
So it's true. The Greybeards really were summoning you.
Someday I'll take over the mill... when I'm old enough.
Sorry Hemming, I've no interest in becoming your valet.
Spiced Wine here. First cup is paid for by the college.
Stand back and watch a true professional wreck a party.
Still the same. I tell you, something's got to be done.
Suit yourself. If you change your mind, I'll be around.
Suppose so. Got one all saddled if you've got the coin.
Sure, and I'm Queen Barenziah. Now tell me another one.
Take home Windhelm's finest and freshest produce today!
Thank you for your help.  Did you see my family inside?
Thank you! I thought that beast would be the end of me!
That amount should allow me to readily acquire a drink.
That hasn't changed, has it? Then just tell them again.
That means your out. No jobs, no payouts... no nothing.
That much? I mean, of course. If that's all you've got.
The College is not the only place to learn about magic.
The days of staying within Largashbur's walls are over.
The Greybeards? What do those old hermits want with me?
The guy in from Dragon Bridge? He didn't seem the type.
The last wheat shipment fetched a fine price at market.
The recipes were hailed as both practical and decadent.
The scroll will give the deep vision needed to open it.
The temple, Betrid? You were one of Dibella's faithful?
The torture room. Gods, I wish we didn't need these....
There he goes. Looks like he's gone for good this time.
There's not enough money in the world to replace Gleda.
These bastards call themselves Imperial Legionnaires...
They'll no doubt strike whenever and wherever they can.
They're none of her business, and none of yours either.
Things are so much quieter with my darling Frabbi dead.
This has all been foreseen, and we must play our parts.
This is good. Could you show the way to the tomb again?
This place has seen better days, but it's not my fault.
This should shake the loyalty of the dov who serve him.
Unless you can control it, it can and will destroy you.
Very well. But I suspect her grace will not be pleased.
Visiting Riften? All are welcome at the Temple of Mara.
We are close now. Can you hear the Lexicon calling out?
We both agree it's best to keep these matters in house.
We can get better acquainted once the ceremony's ended.
We just need the shards of the blade and the hilt, now.
We must be getting close. We should proceed cautiously.
We need coin, Ranmir, and you're not bringing home any.
We need to find the burial mound. Let's ask in the inn.
We never should have pulled that thing out of Saarthal.
We should get started. Alduin is only getting stronger.
We should keep moving. Still the draugr to worry about.
Well that depends on what the favor is, now doesn't it.
Well what are you going to do then, huh? Let's hear it!
Well, I suppose I could use a hand with something, yes.
Well, look at you. If only everyone acted like you did.
Well, offer still stands if you ever want to have a go.
What are you hunting? Never mind. I don't want to know.
What have you got for me today? Nothing illegal I hope!
What in the name of Oblivion is going on in this place?
When has any good ever come from talking to the Empire?
When I grow up, will I go to the College in Winterhold?
Wolf Queen. Hear our call and awaken. We summon Potema!
Wonderful, just wonderful! I knew I could count on you!
Yeah, but can he hammer the anvil for 8 hours straight?
Yeah, we'll get the valuables out of there, no problem!
Yeah, your right. Probably a waste of your time anyway.
Yes! Yes, you can. She's all saddled up and everything.
Yes. The Skull has been destroyed and Dawnstar is safe.
You can't be too careful. Thalmor spies are everywhere.
You have come! You have come to hear the word of Talos!
You have earned the right to call yourself my Champion.
You have something to say, dog? Something on your mind?
You hear about the Shatter-shield girl? It's a tragedy.
You know what I mean. Forges have personalities, right?
You mess with the Silver-Blood family, you end up here.
You should be more careful with the men you pick, dear.
You speak to Igmund. Son of Hrolfdir. Jarl of Markarth.
You want to talk? Finish those jobs for Brynjolf first.
You wear the armor of a mercenary. Now that's the life.
You'll never reach the Emperor! Not while I'm standing!
You're a traveller, correct? Have you been to Whiterun?
You're a war hero, Brunwulf. Ulfric will listen to you.
You're after that damn hilt? Go ahead, try and take it!
You're lucky I respect the Greybeards' council, Galmar!
You've returned. What happened in the Hall of the Dead?
Your mother seems to have taken to her seat quite well.
Your perseverance will only lead you to disappointment.
..wha?... where?... D-destroy this place! Tear it apart!
[QUOTE]Olaf grabbed power, by promise and threat;[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]The bloodiest beef in the Reach![QUOTE] Ha ha ha.
A bit of warming wine, Illdi. You know you can't resist.
A monster? No. I'm just a servant. To my king, Madanach.
Aela will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp.
Ah, yes. Thank you. I'll get to work on this right away.
Ah! The Hall of Stories... we must be getting close now.
All right, but hurry. Who knows if Azura is watching us?
All right, but if you get arrested don't blame it on me.
All right, meat, it's time for you to earn your freedom.
Alright legionnaires! Spread out and see what we've got.
An alchemy lab, it could be in here.  It's worth a look.
An Elder Scroll? That's not going to be easy to come by.
And as Companions, our glory must always be hard-fought.
And here's the spoils. Plenty more where this came from!
Anything I can help you with? A drink or a room perhaps?
Anything you can find would be of great help. Good luck.
Are you mad? Apologize, or I will gut you like a horker.
As his housecarl, Igmund's security is my chief concern.
As you may know Talos worship is outlawed in the Empire.
Aye, we used to be fast friends, though it was long ago.
Bandits attacked and ransacked my cart. Can you help me?
Be careful, the road to Shor's Stone could be dangerous.
Be careful! That murderer could be anywhere, and anyone.
Blessed are those who worship, for they know true grace.
Blessings of the Eight Divines upon you. How may I help?
But I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.
But I digress. Here, take these to your, um... superior.
But I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
But no one wanted to believe. Believe they even existed.
By the gods! The Gourmet has killed the Emperor! Attack!
By Ysmir, are you thick, or just too new to know better?
By Ysmir's beard! I didn't know it was gonna be a party!
Can I interest you in anything? Some fine armor perhaps?
Can't wait to hear all about the next person you murder.
Come on. Give me your hand, I'm getting you out of here.
Come on. Hurry it up already. The waiting is killing me.
Come, Galmar. Where's your sense of the dramatic moment?
Damn Nords. Always getting in the way of us honest folk.
Did you have any luck tracking own some more pitchforks?
Did you tell him you were Dragonborn? I didn't think so.
Do you ever get tired of long nights at the mill, Zaria?
Do you know Dragonsreach? The Jarl of Whiterun's palace?
Do you take me for a fool? Get this drivel away from me!
Don't forget, this whole idea was Atmah's to begin with.
Don't have much to say unless you're here to mine metal.
Don't mind me. I'm just running errands for the old man.
Don't talk to me, you're supposed to be at the ceremony!
Eat? No, I don't think I'm... hungry. Not now, at least.
Farewell. I'll be certain to give Brynjolf your regards.
Few can resist my charms. Even fewer are worthy of them.
Fire, frost, or lightning - you will suffer at my hands!
Follow me. Master Borri will test your Whirlwind Sprint.
Following me, huh? You're not very good at this are you?
Get over to Winterhold. We're mounting our final attack!
Good job! I knew I gave the mission to the right person.
Got a pretty full stock of potions and alchemy reagents.
Hadvar, thank Talos! Your friend told me about Helgen...
Hah! A girl running a bar? Don't be ridiculous, Minette!
Haldyn's been known to obscure his hideaways with magic.
Harbinger, I'd be honored if you joined me in my search.
Have a good rest. It's the big room with the double bed.
He is, by all accounts, the worst bard in all of Skyrim.
He's a half-decent farmer. Ask him to teach you to farm!
Hey there! I was wondering if I'd run into you out here.
Hey, don't look at me that way! Who are you to judge me?
Hmm? No, no. No! I'm too close now. Can't take the time.
How did you get that, then? No one's seen them in years!
How the tree came to grow there is a bit of a mystery...
I am Savos Aren, Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold.
I can't believe the Empire would turn its back on Talos.
I can't wait to get my hands around that bastard's neck.
I don't know his name. Like I've told already a hundred-
I don't suppose you're going to buy something this time?
I don't think you were followed. Come on. I have a plan.
I got locked up one too many times. Now I'm in for life.
I guess that means you're finished. Here's your payment.
I help, I do the chores. What else would you have me do?
I hope this is important... I get little sleep as it is.
I keep thinking I see something moving in the shadows...
I knew I heard something. What's this bridge doing down?
I like your robes. Are you a sorcerer? From the College?
I love my husband, but he can be a bit... dull at times.
I made my fortune as a sea captain, but now I'm retired.
I misjudged you. You're definitely Stormcloak material. 
I miss Valenwood, but the wilds here are... serviceable.
I suppose it's tough for an old dog to learn new tricks.
I thank you again, friend. You've given me my life back.
I think there is much that we can learn from each other.
I think you're on the wrong side in this war, my friend.
I think, given the state of Skyrim, some might disagree.
I was such a fool. How could I let him use me like that?
I'll forge you a weapon tomorrow. Right now, I'm closed.
I'll never get tired of killing these Imperial bastards.
I'll wait here. Just don't start any trouble without me.
I'll watch for Mercer, just get the information we need.
I'm Calcelmo's nephew. I help him around the laboratory.
I'm just another Forsworn sent to rot here in this mine.
I'm just sayin' you should pick one to settle down with.
I'm selling the best mead in town for cheap. Interested?
I'm Skald's housecarl and head of his guard in Dawnstar.
I'm sorry, but I think you've had enough for the moment.
I'm sorry. We're only interested in helping our patrons.
I've seen a guy in Riften who they seem to think is him.
If I had even a pot to piss in, I'd gladly share. Sorry.
If I wasn't married to Ulfberth, I'd be out of business.
If it means the end of Mercer Frey, you can count me in.
If someone joins the Forsworn, we haul him to the mines.
If there's nothing else, I really must ask you to leave.
If you need a good rumor or two, I think I can oblige...
If you need weapons or armor, see Alvor, the blacksmith.
If you wish to commune with Him, we'll need the incense.
If you're an Imperial spy, better turn around right now.
If you're looking for a room, you want the Four Shields.
Igmund is alive, and I'll keep it that way, Jarl or not.
In Falkreath if I don't know it, it's not worth knowing.
In the name of the Jarl, I'm ordering you to stand fast!
In your death may you find the honor you lacked in life.
Indara and I like to keep to ourselves and run our farm.
Is someone there? Stay back! I don't want to attack you.
It's just the market rabble. We should get back to work.
It's only right seein' as your the important lumber man.
Jewelry for sale. Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.
Job's done, boss. Gave the package to her just you said.
Jorn is the best of the bunch, you should hear him sing.
Just a few more hours and I can crawl under some furs...
Just coat your weapon with it. Then... you get the idea.
Just fists. No weapons, no magic... no crying. Let's go!
Just remember me if you get your hands on anything else.
Just take this damn thing. I never want to see it again.
Keep an eye on the sky. This is only going to get worse.
Keep an eye out for trouble. It's only a matter of time.
Keep your wits about you. Morthal's hardly a safe place.
Let me know if you need anything. We're here to provide.
Look here. There's something strange about this cabinet.
Make no mistake we consider you a protector of Solitude.
Making weapons and armor isn't like making nails at all.
May I just speak with her, please, to clear all this up?
May Kynareth guard you while you pass through her realm!
My boyfriend died. Things won't be the same without him.
My brother tells me you've done us a service. Thank you.
My kinswoman died. Things won't be the same without her.
My only regret is that she doesn't host them more often.
My place is chief and my challenge is to lead my people.
Need a blade? You should talk to Adrianne, at the forge.
Need any more pickpocket training, you just let me know.
No tricks, Karliah or I'll cut you down where you stand.
No. Not now. Not until you return to the path of wisdom.
Nobody ever expects a fireball from the darkened corner.
Not hot enough. Does your Skyrim ever get warm, husband?
Not much further. Come, little thing. Serve me in death.
Not my problem. You want through here, you pay. Or else.
Not quick enough, otherwise Gallus would still be alive.
Not sure what's up there, but I bet the Greybeards know.
Nothing like free labor to make operating costs cheaper.
Now it is in your hands. Let us work wonders together...
Now some worry this wizard, Falion, will foul it all up.
Now we can both pretend this whole thing never happened.
Now, if you're ready, I got another special job for you.
Of course they do, brother. You keep raising their rent.
Of course! You can't make good mead without happy honey!
Of course. Let me see if we have another bottle of that.
Oh, but the Dwemer had more than even Septimus expected.
Oh, isn't that a shame. And here I am in the Bloodworks.
Oh, wait... did you say Goldenglow Estate? My apologies.
Oh. I'm sorry. Well, it's good to have you here, anyway.
Oh. Oh yes! Yes, the kindly stranger can certainly help!
Only a true Orc knows how to temper Orichalcum properly.
Or not. There's no guarantee with prophecy. Merely hope.
Ought put on some clothes. Bound to upset some people...
Our men are getting massacred out there. Damn Imperials.
Peace! Everyone stand down. That's an order. Stand down!
Perfect, my dear. Absolutely perfect. I'll see you then.
Please be careful here. The site isn't entirely secured.
Please help me look. He has a bright red beard and hair.
Please. My family means too much to me. Don't hurt them.
Prison's not so bad. Less complaints when I kill people.
Ralof's alive? I hope that's true. He's a damn good man.
Remember, I've got the freshest meat in all of Whiterun.
Silver-Bloods tax everything now that they run the city.
Sneak that ring back to Viola before we both get caught.
So have you ever actually spoken to Captain Lonely-Gale?
So it's true. You've turned traitor. I can't believe it.
So what if I have a problem? I know how to deal with it!
Some day Camilla will know of my affections. Some day...
Speak to one of the others if you wish to buy something.
Stick with me, and they'll never even know you're there.
Still suspicious of me. Well, don't say I never offered.
Take this. Every single coin I owe is there, I swear it.
Take what you need, my friend. Within reason, of course.
Tell me what you need, and I'll get my people get on it.
Thank you, friend. It's good to know I can count on you.
Thank you, good patrons of the Bannered Mare! Thank you!
Thank you. Let me show you some tricks around the forge.
That might be so, but it will never stop me from trying.
That someone would attack Jorrvaskr... it's unthinkable.
That was three days. I'm thinking more like three weeks.
That's Aela, Skjor, and the brothers, Farkas and Vilkas.
That's more gold than they're offering. Fine. I'll sell.
That's Solitude just ahead. Only a few more minutes now.
That's true, but I'm in a new house now. A better house.
That's why I come here to talk to you. You're all heart.
The air has the smell of beasts. The hunt is good today.
The Jarl gives me two incompetent assistants. Worthless.
The mine will be running better than ever thanks to you.
The nightmares are an echo of her presence as she feeds.
The orcs have breached the inner sanctum, Brother Veren.
The outer walls are strong. If we can hold them there...
The secret to chopping meat is never washing your hands.
The sooner we can get out of this filth-pit, the better.
The Stormcloaks are living on borrowed time, believe me.
The way you and your mother forge weapons is impressive.
There were many good battles, friend. I miss those days.
These fruits and vegetables are disappointing, Carlotta.
They can turn the tide of a battle in a moment's notice.
They haven't moved out of the caves. I think we're safe.
They're beautiful. I can see why he wanted to find them.
This appears to lead somewhere. Let's see where it goes.
This is no test, new blood. This is a gift. Come inside.
This is the part where you fall down and bleed to death!
This is your last warning. Get away from there, or else.
This may sound obvious, but do you see a lever anywhere?
Thorald's disappearance has left our family in shambles.
Thorgar says we'll find rocks soon, the kind worth gold.
Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!
Treat the Jarl with respect, and you'll be welcome here.
Tulvur! I've just completed inspection of the farmhouse.
Two Imperial drunks who thought they were above the law.
Ugh. That armor stinks of death. You been grave robbing?
Uh, Brelas, sir. Did you need a drink? Something to eat?
Vekel doesn't like strangers snooping around the Flagon.
Viarmo, the college really must take a stand on the war!
Vilkas and I have been here since we were little whelps.
Vilkas, take him out to the yard and see what he can do.
Vivienne, could you check out supplies of mandrake root?
War may be good for business, but it's hard on families.
Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?
Was there anything else, or is our transaction complete?
We are honored to welcome a Dragonborn to High Hrothgar.
We barely made it out alive, and you want to go back in?
We can never rest easy, for Balgruuf's enemies will not.
We have nothing to talk about until Paarthurnax is dead.
We have our wedding soon, don't we? That's right, we do!
We might be poor, but is it really any better out there?
We want compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.
We want compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.
We want compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.
We want compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.
We warned you, but you just had to go and cause trouble.
We'll get him when he comes back around. Hold your fire.
We'll have to have a pint together sometime, you and me.
We're causing no trouble. All we ask is to look for her.
We're going to make sure he doesn't get his hands on it.
We're keeping the mine closed until that crypt is clear.
Welcome to the Thalmor Embassy. Your invitation, please.
Well, certainly none of this will benefit my research...
Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain.
Well, if you change your mind, I'd still like your help.
Well, looks like you're running the show now. Good luck.
Well. I do suppose thanks are in order. So... my thanks.
Well... This seems to be in order. Very well, follow me.
What are you out here talking to me for? Party's inside.
What did you say? You lazy coward, I'll cut your throat.
What do you make of it... the dragon? What does it mean?
What, did you suddenly grow a conscience? Suit yourself.
What? What did I do this time? I was just standing here!
What's wrong, dear friend? You seem... distracted today.
Whatever you have to say to the Jarl, you can say to me.
Whenever I get out of here, I'm going to go kill a Nord.
Whether it's armor you need or a new blade, come see me.
Who said anything about trouble? Now get out of my face.
Who? You mean that woman who was attacked in the market?
Wouldn't even be here if it weren't for my idiot sister.
Wouldn't want to offend our Thalmor overlords, would we?
Yeah, my problem is I'm too tired to punch your face in.
Yes, Sir. Although I'm not sure you'll be happy to know.
You deserve something for sniffing out that thief. Here.
You going to lose horribly, and then say you let me win?
You have done well thus far, but trying times are ahead.
You have to find the way out first. Good luck with that.
You heal away my scars and there's gonna be a problem...
You just find that lying around? Must be your lucky day.
You left this over there. You want it back, right? Here.
You look new. I'm new, too. I think we could be friends.
You match the bet and we fight until one of us gives in.
You men are utter pigs... you only care about one thing.
You seek that which all who wield magic seek. Knowledge.
You take it back then? You retract your statement? Well?
You will talk when you're ready, won't you? Won't you...
You wish to kill me? Someone has already had that honor.
You... didn't mean... yourself. You meant... Pelagius...
You'd better have a damned good reason for being here...
You'll be looking to rent Tiber Septim's room I take it?
You're an outsider. You're dangerous-looking. You'll do.
You're lookin' at a real warrior! At least I used to be.
You're quite noisy for someone who claims to be a thief.
You've found the Bards College kitchen. Congratulations.
Your schedule is always clear, Arch-Mage. I see to that.
Your selection looks very delicious. I'll take an apple.
Your Thu'um is strong, Dovahkiin. But not strong enough!
A true friend is a gift. Here. I'd like you to have this.
A very pretty speech, but what does it have to do with...
A wealthy family has... misplaced one of their heirlooms.
A woman -- a foreigner in these lands. Redguard, like us.
Aaaahhhhhrrrr.... the pain, somebody, stop... the pain...
After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again.
After I've finished showing you the grounds, we can talk.
Against six College-trained mages? I think we'll be fine.
Ah finally, someone besides the stupid guards to talk to.
Ah, here's the proud groom now. Let's begin the ceremony.
Ah, I see you have the wine. Hand it over and we'll talk.
Ah, Nana Ildene, whatever would my family do without you?
Ah, the new disciple. I hear you have quite the appetite.
Ah, the sneaky type, eh? I think we can fix you right up.
Ah, yes. Rented the nicest room we had for a whole month.
Ain't nothing pretty about a corpse. No matter how fresh.
Alright now. Everyone back away. Let the law handle this.
An ornament, solid gold. In the shape of a dragon's claw.
And danger ahead? Why that doesn't make any sense at all.
And found my favor. That skin will serve you well, child.
And I will make you the instrument of my cleansing light.
And now we come to the end of our play. The grand finale.
And the Emperor will be forced to come clean up the mess.
Are you joking? Even I wouldn't sell something like that.
Aringoth was a fool to think he could get away with this.
As soon as I get back to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready.
Avanchnzel. Take it to Avanchnzel. You must take it back.
Besides, Gray-Mane would never make steel for the Legion.
Better question would be [QUOTE]what did he leave.[QUOTE]
Boys, girls, dogs, elders - there's nobody I won't fight!
Brond's one of the most savage fighters I've ever seen...
But aren't the Circle in charge? And don't you lead them?
But at least we ended up with the damn crown. Now then...
But first, tell me. Why's a cat want to fight for Skyrim?
But let's not talk about it anymore. What's done is done.
But not all of them, because some of them are still here.
Can I... I could help you. He'd talk to me. He trusts me.
Can the sawmill handle those logs? They look a might big.
Can we really just make things up? It doesn't seem right.
Can you help me find someone? There's gold in it for you.
Cap'n Wayfinder's as green as seaweed, but he's learnin'.
Captain Lonely-Gale has been avoiding me, I just know it.
Clear Skies will blow away the mist, but only for a time.
Come on in. We got warm food, warm drinks, and warm beds.
Come on, take another job so we can both make some money.
Darkwater Crossing is a difficult journey. Mind yourself.
Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favor.
Don't come back until every one of those things are dead.
Don't tell me you, of all people, are afraid of a battle.
Don't you go trackin' your dirty boots on my clean floor!
Dovahkiin, you should not have come here. Nu hin sil dii.
Even Vignar couldn't remember Companions younger than us!
Every Nord should admire Ulfric. He fights for all of us.
Everyone knows the dwarves disappeared. No one knows why.
Excellent work. I knew you'd bring back something useful.
Fair winds and calm seas. That's an old sailor's parting.
Father promised me a new dress days ago, now where is it?
For thousand-year old ruins, they're not much to look at.
Forgive me, but at what point does it become our concern?
Fruits and vegetables, all ripe and ready for your table!
Get over to the capital! We're mounting our final attack!
Go on without me. I think I need to be alone for a while.
Good luck finding those jazbay grapes, they're very rare.
Good talking to you. Not many care to chat with the help.
Good. And remember - keep the gods, and they'll keep you.
Grab Gunjar's gear. No shame in borrowing a friend's axe.
Grelka, how fast can you get your hands on some longbows?
Ha! Four more geldings sold. Sound like good news to you?
Hadvar? What are you doing here? Are you on leave from...
Halt! You have no business here, outsider. Leave at once.
Hand what over? I have no idea what you're talking about.
Have you heard the story of how we came to be werewolves?
Have you lost all sense? We are short on guards as it is!
Have you met my husband? Well don't bother, he's a drunk.
He seems to value my thoughts, and I'm grateful for that.
He was the one I looked up to. I need to find my brother.
He's asked far, far too many questions about my research.
He's close. I'm certain of it. We must prepare ourselves.
Here, take your coin and tell Brynjolf to leave us alone.
Here. I'd like you to have this as a token my friendship.
Here's your armor, just make sure you put it to good use.
Hey, where do you think you're going? We have work to do.
Hin aar, orin nu. And yet here I am, still your prisoner.
Hiya! What's your name? Are you visiting? What do you do?
Hod! Come here a minute. I need your help with something.
I am honored to be called for this duty. Please, lead on.
I can send you into Azura's Star as soon as you're ready.
I can't help you, friend. Talk to Hadring, the Innkeeper.
I consider even talking to the Empire a generous gesture.
I do hope you know what you're doing with those flames...
I don't care that we lost, I'm just glad the war is over.
I don't dare leave the house myself. So I need your help.
I don't know where I'll go. Somewhere far away from here.
I don't talk to people who drink that Black Briar drench.
I doubt it can be repaired. You'll have to buy a new one.
I have no idea what connection they'd have to this place.
I have poisons for your weapons, and cures for your ills.
I have to admit. This is more fun that I thought it'd be.
I hope this truce gives you what you need. It won't last.
I left his head on a pike at the wreckage of the caravan.
I love hearing Ogmund sing at the inn. He's a true skald.
I misspoke. Never mind what I said. Now get back to work.
I never agreed. And if you are right, I will not need it.
I only take real coin here, no handouts and no bartering.
I said no! No adventures, no theatrics, no thief-chasing!
I see you wish to be reasonable, perhaps I misjudged you.
I see. So you don't remember fondling the statuary, then?
I shall explain to you the mysteries of the outer realms.
I shall have vengeance for the death of my husband. Rise!
I still almost can't believe it... a real, live dragon...
I think everyone's waiting for the ceremony to get going.
I think you accidentally mislaid this, dear. Here you go.
I think you need to calm down before I summon the guards.
I told you, I've got no patience for fools. Keep walking.
I was a beauty in my day, dearie. Don't act so surprised.
I will send word to her family that she is in good hands.
I wish I could say that it was, but it's not that simple.
I work silver, like my father, and his father before him.
I... have been known to change my mind. So... go. Really.
I'd just assume die before I'd let Mercer get those gems.
I'll be over here if you need any potions or ingredients.
I'll handle it. No need to blow things out of proportion.
I'll not argue that. Heard any interesting gossip lately?
I'll return my ancestors to Sovngarde, and you with them!
I'll stay here. You try not to get into too much trouble.
I'm already looking forward to getting back above ground.
I'm composing a new song. A ballad, for Camilla Valerius.
I'm in no mood for conversation. Now go, and leave me be.
I'm quite busy. Need something or can I get back to work?
I'm telling you, Ulfric's planning an attack on Whiterun.
I'm the hardest worker in Left Hand. Better than any man.
I've already ordered my men to muster near the main gate.
I've been holding on to this for you. I hope you like it.
I've been thinking, would you like to join me in hunting?
I've certainly learned more here than I ever expected to.
I've got plenty of good merchandise for you. Take a look.
I've no idea what killed her, but I'm sure something did.
If all the young people leave, what happens to Ivarstead?
If it's not too much to ask, put the weapon away? Thanks.
If this keeps up, I'm headed back to the Winking Skeever.
If you desire to fight me, then let's get this over with.
If you want to talk about my brother, I'm not interested.
If you've got the time to sell, I've got the time to buy.
Imperial dogs... there's nothing that's too low for them.
In these parts? Good luck. But don't come this way again.
Instead you've chosen to fall over your own foolish code.
Is it cold in here? I should put more wood on the fire...
It fills us with rage. What harm does it bring to us now?
It is imperative that you return to your College at once.
It should be in a small bottle, very similar to a potion.
It's a long way to the next city if you change your mind.
It's just that... what do these Greybeards want with her?
It's just that... what do these Greybeards want with him?
It's not safe out here! Return to your homes immediately!
It's our name for the old sewers that run under the city.
It's time we put a little kink in the Emperor's security.
Karliah's close, I'm certain of it. Now let's get moving.
Keerava's stubborn, but she's got a soft spot for family.
Klimmek is doing just fine. You should follow your heart.
Kolskeggr Mine is lost, friend. Forsworn killed everyone.
Lady Mara will save us from these nightmares. You'll see.
Lisbet handles the customers. I just check the shipments.
Lone travelers can find these woods a little treacherous.
Look at that, a cave. Who knows what could be down there?
Look at those old stones. Ancient Nords sure could build.
Lucky for you that was just sitting there for the taking.
Lynly, would you mind taking care of the customer please?
Many have fallen in this crypt. The Draugr show no mercy.
Mara, I forgot how late it was. Need to lock up the shop.
Mind you don't cross Tassius. He's in charge around here.
My blade is sharp and I thirst for battle. Onward, then! 
My eyes inside Cidhna Mine tell me that Madanach is dead.
My family didn't really approve of me coming here at all.
My girlfriend died. Things won't be the same without her.
My pa always warned me not to mess with places like this.
Need a trained war dog? Fiercest companion money can buy.
Nice try, but those bandits almost killed me. Now pay up.
No new boots? Does this mean the Argonian is still alive?
No problem, I'll find someone else. Don't worry about it.
No, but they made off with all our fragments of Wuuthrad.
No, Farkas, he didn't. And that's not what this is about.
No? Do you care about rotting away for a month in a cell?
Not many wood elves would choose to come alone to Skyrim.
Not my finest hour. Roggvir was a fine and honorable man.
Nothing here but the mine. Probably best you keep moving.
Now, as far as I'm concerned, none of this ever happened.
Now, you tell me when you're ready and we'll get started.
Of course... your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lad.
Oh no! You're the one from Brynjolf's outfit, aren't you?
Oh yes, mistress. You're the [QUOTE]boss.[QUOTE] For now.
Oh yes, that. Here you go. I hope this can be ready soon.
Oh, gods, please! Let me live! I'll do anything you want!
Oh, goodness no. There are those far more skilled than I.
Oh, I see. Well, I'm sorry to have troubled you about it.
Oh, no skeevers out here, sir. They can't stand the cold.
Oh, okay. I didn't think you'd help me. Nobody ever does.
Oh! You startled me. I wasn't expecting company out here.
Oh. Well, that's... awkward. Sorry to have brought it up.
Only twenty gold septims! Hurry before my supply is gone.
Our business has concluded and you're standing in my way.
Papa, the next time you go away, I want to come with you.
Pay you to protect me? You can't even protect yourselves!
Peace may yet return to Skyrim. But until then, we fight.
Please keep your weapons sheathed in the Jarl's presence.
Ralof! What are you doing here? Ah... I'll be right down.
Remain true to the Way of the Voice, and you will return.
Seen a lot of travelers lately. Mostly soldier, nowadays.
She's here? By Sithis, I thought we'd lost her. Let's go!
Silana, you don't seem yourself. Is something the matter?
Silent means I don't tell and it's none of your business.
So many say that, at first, until they realize the truth.
So what happened at the watchtower? Was the dragon there?
So you're the Dragonborn I've been hearing so much about.
So, he says to petition Malacath for relief? Interesting.
Sorry, I don't know anything about those kinds of things.
Sounds fair. She's yours. Like I said, she's all saddled.
Speak, I wish to hear everything my subjects have to say.
Stand back. Interrupting an execution is a serious crime.
Stop, outlander! You must pay bloodprice for your crimes.
Strike when the shoulder turns. He's giving you openings!
Support Ulfric or die trying. There's nothing in between.
Svana, I heard that Sibbi was put in jail. What happened?
Tell me you looked through the trash before you did that.
Thank you, soldier. Let's take a look at these reports...
Thanks a lot. Here - a little something for your trouble.
That is all I will say, for it grieves me to speak of it.
That's all I can do, you idiot. What are you waiting for?
That's disgusting, get that rotting carcass away from me!
That's her business. Not mine. Probably not yours either.
That's her! That's who was asking about Esbern! Kill her!
That's him! That's who was asking about Esbern! Kill him!
That's how I slipped in there. Should still be unguarded.
The Arch-Mage believed it important. It must be powerful.
The circumstances differ. This time I have what you seek.
The good people of Morthal have yet to embrace my talent.
The great stronghold of Narzulbur welcomes you, outsider.
The kind that evaluates your usefulness during... duress.
The Mace of Molag Bal! I give you its true power, mortal.
The old man said to have a look at you, so let's do this.
The sealing structure interlocks in the tiniest fractals.
The undercroft is ahead... ugh, Necromancers. Be careful.
The Wabbajack! Huh? Huh? Didn't see that coming, did you?
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Winterhold.
Then it is true what they said? I am touched by the gods?
Then this is it. We do this for Gallus and for the Guild.
Then we show them Gallus's journal and hope for the best.
There are many valuable artifacts all through the temple.
There are so many delightful ways I've pictured you dead.
There is a certain beast in these lands. Large, majestic.
These spells are difficult, even for one as skilled as I.
They can't hurt uncle Roggvir. Tell them he didn't do it.
They don't seem to be very sympathetic to our cause, sir.
They live here too, my Jarl. That's what I'm telling you.
Things look quiet enough here. Come on. There's my uncle.
This good deed should not go unrewarded. Here, take this!
This is it, you know. Through this door. Can you feel it?
This is the Hall of the Dead. Someday you'll end up here.
This is the Old Hroldan Inn. Clean beds and strong drink.
This man is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?
Too lazy to walk, eh? Well, you've found the right place.
Tread lightly in the Hall. We don't know what's in there.
Try again? You and me? Fine, but I've got my eyes on you.
Under deep. Below the dark. The hidden keep. Tower Mzark.
Very good, Thongvor. It relieves me to hear you say that.
Very well. I trust a hefty purse of septims will suffice?
Vilkas, take her out to the yard and see what she can do.
Vision? What vision are you talking about? Oh, no matter.
Wait a second. Looks like there's something in this cage.
Wander no more, for you are among friends here, and safe.
Wanderer like you must have quite an appetite. Some food?
War dogs cost gold, friend. Come back when you have some.
Watching you reminds me of my first days as an enchanter.
We all do. It is our burden to bear. But we can overcome.
We are the Greybeards, followers of the Way of the Voice.
We can meet you there, or all travel together, your call.
We can't march on Solitude. Not yet. One thing at a time.
We have an interest in one of those boats, the Icerunner.
We just need the pommel and the shards of the blade, now.
We need to get to safety as soon as possible. Let's move.
We want compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.
We won't kill you, outlander, but we don't want you here.
We'd better get moving before any more Imperials show up.
We'll need to set up water brigades to combat the flames.
We'll show those faithless dogs who this land belongs to.
We're escaping, Hadvar. You're not stopping us this time.
We've made a bit of gold. Here, love, this is your share.
Well, Dragonborn. What do you say? Do you want the honor?
Were you? The hubris of the Blades truly knows no bounds.
What does a fellow need to do to get a drink around here?
What in blazes is going on? Are you working with Karliah?
What next, Tullius? Shall I just hand over all of Skyrim?
What? Why, the audacity! How dare you imply such a thing!
What's a man to do if he can't look to his Jarl for help?
Who does that? Who just leaves their garbage lying about?
Why don't you head back out to Yngvild and find the rest?
Why should I pay for a repair on something I just bought?
Why thank you for that most colorful assessment, Skulvar.
Why would I give you that, if I wouldn't give you Riften?
Windhelm is the first city on that road, and here we are.
Without that axe, this whole land would be overrun still.
Would you happen to be headed towards Darkwater Crossing?
Wow! Didn't think I could get that for her. I mean, sure!
Wujeeta, you're worrying me. You look so... well, so sad.
Yes, lad, you've been raised into the Companions, I hear.
Yes! Yes! You see, you know but you refuse to understand!
You come to Dawnstar at a bad time. Tempers are... fiery.
You could have warned me you were baiting me into a trap.
You did it! All three targets in eight seconds. Nice job.
You had best take advantage of this truce while it lasts.
You mean they used a Shout to defeat Alduin? You're sure?
You must take the Lexicon from me. Please... take it now.
You risk death by doing so, and you shall not gain entry.
You should speak with my husband. Skaggi runs everything.
You there. Have you performed your voice exercises today?
You think Stormcloaks and Legionnaires are dangerous? Ha!
You trespass here, shadow-walker. Shor does not know you.
You wear the armor of the bear, my friend. A fine choice.
You went into Bleak Falls Barrow and got that? Nice work.
You're in it deep... better start shoveling your way out.
You're making me... nervous. Is there something you need?
You're not getting anything until you pay the Guild back.
You're not planning on using that weapon in here, I hope.
You're wrong to come here, stranger. No rest in Dawnstar.
You've been quiet so far. What do you think we should do?
You've got a lot of nerve. But not a lot of common sense.
You've seen them? Then waste no time, head there at once!
Your pockets... they're a little low on coin. I can tell.
Your wedding will be held tomorrow, from dawn until dusk.

A few coins for my soul? If only you understood the irony.
A gift, Dovahkiin. Toor. Understand Inferno as the dov do.
A poison stew, eh? I was always partial to apples, myself.
A storeroom. Grab anything you can, but let's keep moving.
A strong sword-arm wins battle, but a keen mind wins wars.
Again? But there shouldn't be any earthstreams over there.
Ah, the sweet smell of burnt flesh. Nothing better really.
Ah, yes. Umm, no. No, I don't think so. Not at this point.
Ah. You must mean that one over there. He's not one of us.
All right, all right. It's Karliah... her name is Karliah.
All this talk of dragons is making people antsy. Nonsense!
Alva's been good to me ever since... well, since the fire.
Always. Let's go see if we can find this Sky Haven Temple.
An outsider? No reason to stop in Kynesgrove. Keep moving.
And it's my honor to be first to address you as Harbinger.
Anything else, Enthir? Anything about... the Nightingales?
Are you alright, Ahlam? You haven't seemed yourself today.
Are you quite sure? I don't want to get in the way, but...
As a matter of fact, there is something you can do for me.
As a Nightingale, I took an oath and was sworn to secrecy.
As anyone will tell you, Morthal can be a dangerous place.
Assur and I are playing a game. Don't tell him where I am!
Aye, now that's some fine armor. Good old-fashioned steel.
Bah. Weak-willed rabble. Even dead they're almost useless.
Be on the lookout. The Butcher could be around any corner!
Be sure to stop by Sadri's Used Wares in the Gray Quarter.
Bersi still refuses to cooperate. What did you want to do?
Better yet, she won't make my head ring the morning after.
Beyond asking for you, he never said. Very strange indeed.
Brand-Shei... have you managed to find those boots for me?
But first, tell me. Why's an Elf want to fight for Skyrim?
But first, tell me. Why's an Orc want to fight for Skyrim?
But I sense that perhaps you're after more than just that.
But most of their supply routes come south, from Cyrodiil.
But, never mind all that. We've got a job to do. Don't we?
But.. stealing the boss's sword? Did he have a death wish?
By the gods, that man nearly killed me. You saved my life.
Captain Lonely-Gale! I've been looking for you everywhere!
Careful with those. Don't want even more fragments, do we?
Cicero is at your service, oh great and powerful Listener!
Come back and see me if you ever need pickpocket training.
Corruption, lies and deceit are the order of the day here.
Disgusting. Ruined sewers filled with goodness knows what.
Don't forget my name. Someday, everyone will be saying it.
Don't forget to check your supply chest from time to time.
Don't let the door slam into your backside on the way out.
Don't mean to be rude, but I'm too busy to talk right now.
Don't reach for a shiv around me, or we'll both regret it.
Dorthe won't eat that. Are you trying to starve the child?
Dum, di di dum, dum di dum, dum di di di di dum da da dum.
Esbern. We need information, not a lecture on art history.
Ever tried taking care of children? It can be a nightmare.
Farkas will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp.
Filthy Nord. In time, your entire race will be eradicated.
Fine, fine. Get your hands off me. I'll be a good boy now.
Fine. I can't force you to help me, but the offer is open.
Forgive me milady, I didn't recognize you! Please proceed.
Forgive me milord, I didn't recognize you! Please proceed.
Friends like you are hard to find and very valuable to me.
Gah. Let's do this already. I'm itching to kill something.
Get under cover! The dragon - it's still around somewhere!
Good luck getting one of the guards to help with anything.
Good. Now move quickly. And don't leave any of them alive.
Got to admire the chops it takes to walk around like that.
Have you mastered the Expert level destruction spells yet?
He will continue to sow discord and chaos wherever he can.
Head for the Great Hall, quickly! Don't stop for anything!
Here we are, found a key. Let's see if it opens that door.
Here, I had him make you a few things for all that travel.
Here, please accept this gift as a token of our gratitude.
Hey... So are you ever going to make me invisible or what?
How can you just sit here and wait? We should be in there!
Hroggar blames his wife for spilling bear fat in the fire.
Hurry and get me out of this cage before they come for me!
I apologize for the disruption to such a festive occasion.
I can only imagine the headaches this is going to cause...
I can pat you on the back all day, but coin's coin, right?
I can't believe we let provincials like you wander Skyrim.
I can't decide if things are about to get worse or better.
I can't sleep here. The dreams are even worse than before.
I can't think of a better person for the job, Nightingale.
I don't haggle. If you want a lower price, look elsewhere.
I don't have any business with you, so get out of my face.
I don't know what we're doing here, but orders are orders.
I don't much like this truce. Feels like a betrayal to me.
I don't think you understand. I'm not answering questions.
I hate seeing a good mine go to waste like that, you know?
I have some questions for you. I'm trying to find someone.
I hear Endon's quite pleased to have his merchandise back.
I heard you're the reason we get to have this.  Thank you.
I like it here. We should have moved to Dawnstar ages ago.
I like to share my good fortune with those who deserve it.
I love my brother, but his brains are not his strong suit.
I must speak to Delphine at once. There's no time to lose.
I sell cures for all ills, and I'll be happy to serve you.
I should heat up the forge. Why does it have to be so hot?
I try to keep Grimvar safe, but these are dangerous times.
I won't forget. I'll do it after I get the dishes cleaned.
I wouldn't worry about that. He's a good elf. I trust him.
I'd follow you into the depths of Oblivion, you know that.
I'd wager I could crack rock faster than anyone. Even you.
I'll be waiting by the door for everyone to be distracted.
I'll begin preparations. Thank you again so much for this.
I'll contact my man tonight and let you know what he says.
I'm drunk, and it's been a while since I had a good fight.
I'm fine, Horik. I just... are you worried about this war?
I'm glad you're coming with us. They say Talos favors you.
I'm going to go get it right now and wear it. Many thanks!
I'm going to keep preparing the body, if you'll excuse me.
I'm going to keep this short 'cause we've got a lot to do.
I'm looking forward to testing myself against this dragon.
I'm not sure what to expect here. Please be on your guard.
I'm preparing to leave for the standing stone. What is it?
I'm sick of waiting. When are we going to see some action?
I'm working on some very important research, I assure you.
I've been in the Legion all my life. I'm content to serve.
I've dispatched a rider to Helgen. We'll know soon enough.
I've finally tracked down the last of the Totems, I think.
I've seen you walking with a bit of pain sometimes, Horik.
I've turned over every body, though, and I can't find him.
I've worked in the Treasury House for almost twenty years.
If by message you mean shoving a sword through his gullet.
If there's a chance this will save me, then I'm taking it.
If there's any more I can help you with, just let me know.
If we can't stop this, what happens to the rest of Skyrim?
If you die, then I'll have no further use for your corpse.
If you ever need more practice with the bow, just grab me.
If you had it, you'd be riding and we wouldn't be talking.
If you happen to see it, would you mind bringing it to me?
If you provoke me, I will be forced to unsheathe my claws.
If you two cannot handle this, we can find others to hire.
If you value your well being, you will offer an apology...
If you want my opinion I say it's just plain old bad luck.
If you want the mark that badly then go ahead and take it.
Is it absolutely necessary for you to bother me right now?
Is it just me or is it getting saner and saner these days?
Is that new batch of tomatoes ready for sale yet, Hillevi?
Is that sarcasm? I've heard better wisecracks from Orgnar.
It will be our little nest. I'll be waiting for you there.
It's the damn outlanders and Empire that need the reasons.
It's the past! Dead oaths on dead lips. Let it stay there.
It's thousands of years old. Who knows what we might find?
It's... it's like watching an artist create a masterpiece.
Just say the word if you need a drink or something to eat.
Just watch yourself. You don't want to meet me on the job.
Karliah, when will you learn you can't get the drop on me?
Karliah's been through here. What does she expect to find?
Karthwasten doesn't need outsiders prying in our business.
Keep walkin', softgut. I'm more woman than you can handle.
Keep your eyes open for Forsworn when you're on the roads.
Keep your eyes open, I don't like the looks of this place.
Leigelf is a good man, and I'm not running out on him now.
Let's see those Stormcloaks try to break into this canyon.
Let's see where this goes. We can't be the only survivors.
Look, I had no choice. They're crazy... I could be killed!
Look, you want to know about me? All right, I'll tell you.
Looks like you aren't such a sharp investigator after all.
Mage, eh? Well, to each his own. It's not for me to judge.
Maven has been nagging us about her request. Any thoughts?
Meyye! Tahrodiis aanne! Him hinde pah liiv! Zu'u hin daan!
Mind what you say! The Empire has ears all over this town.
Mind you don't put out that candle on the hearth upstairs!
Mining's my life now, I wouldn't want to do anything else.
muted moans of pain, groans -- someone who's been tortured
My job is to keep the Jarl safe, despite his best efforts.
My what, now? I've never kept a journal, I can assure you.
Names no longer matter. You may refer to me as The Caller.
No visitors. No way. Now piss off, before ya' make me mad.
No. Of course you're right, Unmid. I'll stay here for now.
Not fair. You're well aware I can't seem to get warm here.
Not today. Sold my last one. Pretty sure I sold it to you.
Now I just want to put the whole nasty business behind me.
Now let us see how quickly you can master your new Thu'um.
Now you're being ridiculous. This is our city. Not theirs.
Of course not. You expect me to take care of it by myself?
Of course. I rented a bed there. Where else would I sleep?
Of course. We'll keep Riverwood safe. You can count on it.
Of course... your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lass.
Oh, excellent. I'll see that it gets where it needs to go.
Oh, my love. How I long to take her away from all of this.
Oh, splendid! Just splendid! Mara smiles upon us this day.
Oh, Talos's breath, Reberrus. Skip ahead to the good part.
Oh, thank Arkay. Please, take this gold for your troubles.
Oh! Are you going to teach me how to turn into a mud crab?
Oh. Oh, by the gods, no. No, you can't do this. You can't!
Pardon me, milady. Would you care to hear me play my lute?
Pardon me, milord. Would you care to hear me play my lute?
Please don't allow him to continue to discuss the subject.
Please milady, can you spare a gold coin for an old woman?
Please to meet you, I'm a priestess at the Temple of Mara.
Please, will you help me? There's no one here I can trust.
Poor Nilsine has been wrecked since her sister was killed.
Really? You convinced that lute player to stop chasing me?
Release the Miasma! Release it now! Hurry, Casimir, hurry!
Remember Radiant Raiment when you need a change of attire.
Remember, keep it clean. We don't want blood on our hands.
See if they have any cheese. I'm getting a bit... peckish.
She had a room here. Might talk to the innkeeper about it.
She's so lost in her visions, and it's only getting worse.
Show respect while you're here and you and I will be fine.
Since Galka was taken from us. She's been... sad, I guess.
Skjor and Aela like to tease me, but they are good people.
So I mostly sweep and shovel. You got a problem with that?
So I wouldn't have to answer stupid questions from idiots.
So, Irileth tells me you came from the western watchtower?
So, that's how I earned the name. Now keep it to yourself.
Stay away from the Aretino Residence. The place is cursed.
Take it slow and careful, and I think we can sneak by her.
Thank you, Addvar, I am picky about what I eat these days.
That could have gone worse. Now it's up to you to deliver.
That's the spirit. Vilkas, here, will get started on that.
The ashes were still warm when he pledged himself to Alva.
The Dragonborn has spoken, Tullius. Markarth will be ours.
The graveyard has been lonely. Few pay homage to the dead.
The hofkahsejun has been known as Dragonsreach ever since.
The hospitality of the Thalmor Embassy is at your service.
The Jarl has finally agreed to send you back to Riverwood.
The library is just through here. We're getting close now.
The life of a soldier is full of hardship. That's nothing.
The only way to find fresher meats is to hunt it yourself.
The others have probably prepared Kodlak's funeral by now.
The spirit of Skjor is with us on this errand. I feel him.
The Warrens isn't a place for your type. What do you want?
There is a burning city out there that needs a government.
There's a cave here. Perfect hideout for bandits or worse.
There's only the hilt left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?
There's something you could do for me. For all of us here.
These days? Aye. Most of what I make is for folk like you.
These Forsworn don't even have the decency to dress right.
These wall carvings are ancient, we must be getting close.
This is a curse that was laid upon us. That much is clear.
Thongvor may be the head of the family, but I'm the hands.
Those cursed mages... It's their fault Winterhold is gone.
Try our meats made here at the Festival. They're the best.
Up to no good, are we? I'll teach you, but it'll cost you.
Very well, the conditions are acceptable. You may proceed.
Visitors to the city usually stay at the Silver-Blood Inn.
Volunruud? Well, that is interesting. I know this place...
We all have different means to glory, Stonearm. Well done.
We don't all lead your life of grand adventure, Harbinger.
We just need to move some of these rocks to clear the way!
We should be careful here. See these symbols on the floor?
We should get a dragon for the Pit. I'd love to fight one.
We sure showed them, eh? Thanks for your part in all that.
We want compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.
We're on the right track. She's been through here as well.
We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey.
Well I can't just tell that to any skeever that washes up.
Well we have to harvest somewhere! This is getting absurd.
Well, I'll just have to think of something else then. Bye.
Well, if you do, grab him and yell. Bastard stole from me.
Well, it's been fun. I guess I'll head back to Rorikstead.
Well, that's just about the best news I've heard all week.
Well, yes. Why wouldn't I be? Are you... interested in me?
Well, your classmates certainly seem to disagree with you.
Well? Is it done? Have you reported the fool to the guard?
Well. There's something to be said for honesty, I suppose.
What are you waiting for? Get in there and find that mask.
What brings you to Whiterun? Got some juicy goods to sell?
What does that mean Reberrus? Are we winning or aren't we?
What is it nephew? Can't you see I'm trying to think here?
What? How? I thought they weren't allowed within the city!
What...? Whoever did this, you're dead. You hear me? Dead!
What's he doing? Looking for rubies in rubbish? Get a job!
Where did you learn of that? Who have you been talking to?
Which means you get to tag along on a little trip with me.
While I appreciate the sentiment, I still have to decline.
Who knows. The cat was crazy. She was a fool to trust him.
Why anything would chose to reside down here is beyond me.
Why can't you just settle down and run the Flagon with me?
Why, perhaps the greatest crime spree Skyrim's ever known.
With just myself and one child, it's damn near impossible.
Wonderful! Here, take this. I hope it's fair compensation.
Yes, kind morsel. Let us go up, and mind Melka on the way.
Yes, well so do I. That's why I was hoping you could help.
Yes, wouldn't want to miss the lush summer we have ahead. 
Yes, your head hurts and you don't remember where you are.
Yes. Your reward is waiting for you, mortal. Further down.
Yield. I yield, Stormcloak! The city of Markarth is yours.
You can't force a Nord to accept help he hasn't asked for.
You can't shake us off that easily. Let's see what's here!
You ever hear the one about the Breton and the bear-tamer?
You have caught my attention, mortal. That is most unwise.
You know, I've heard the Gourmet is in Skyrim right now...
You lay one finger on Igmund, and I'll end you Stormcloak.
You look mighty tasty. Better not stick around for supper.
You must have had a wild night if you can't remember that.
You need a sword? Uh, how about a small sword? Nail-sized?
You one of those [QUOTE]Skyrim for the Nords[QUOTE] types?
You remind me of the Shadowscales, from the old histories.
You think it's money I need? I'm a prisoner, not a beggar.
You what? Oh. That. Good. I hope there was a lot of blood.
You'd like to come downstairs with me, is that it, Gissur?
You're looking for something, yes? The... Staff of Magnus.
You're tougher than you look. You got me, fair and square.
You've come to the right place. I'd be happy to teach you.
Your body lies dead, but your soul has joined our ranks...
Your fealty is precious to me. I will make good use of it.
Your latest exploit certainly has the Sanctuary talking...
A few septims ain't nothing. You can spare that, can't you?
A powerful force, not to be crossed. As I learned too late.
A sharp mind beats a sharp blade any day. Words to live by.
Aerin, have you seen my ring? The one with the inscription?
Ah yes. I've studied those documents... Very interesting...
Ah, a secret admirer, eh? Don't worry, I won't tell a soul.
Ah, so the hunter came to know the fear of the hunted, hmm?
Aia. You're so mean. I don't think he means anything by it.
All right. I have everything you asked for all ready to go.
All right. Mother is just outside this door. I have a plan.
Always was a stubborn woman. She's not going to stand down.
An order of warriors. We are brothers and sisters in honor.
And as for you, I owe you a portion of the reward, don't I?
And now you'll walk away, if you know what's good for you. 
And what would my impetuous Thane Bryling suggest, instead?
And why not? I could beat anyone in this city, bare-handed.
Another wanderer, here to lick my father's boots. Good job.
Aye, a whole heap of it. You see that Temple? Way up there?
Before we begin, I want to make two things perfectly clear.
Better get used to it. Snows most all the time in Windhelm.
Better that than dealing with Ulfric's wizard like some do.
Bleak Falls Barrow is just outside of town. I can show you.
Bring up some more mead, my boy. This cask's nearly tapped!
But only if you use the axe to kill Barbas. Simple as that.
But somehow they're still here, and they're killing people.
But talk to Legate Rikke. She handles the local recruiting.
But we've had no contact with them for quite some time now.
But, well... There is one more thing. If you're interested?
By decree of the Jarl, the Alik'r are banned from Whiterun.
By the Eight. She's dead, isn't she? And it's all my fault.
By Ysmir's beard, the nerve of those Imperial bastards, eh?
Can you imagine the looks on their faces when we come back?
Careful though, rumor has it a dragon makes its home there.
Come on, we're finally here! Let's not waste any more time!
Come on. Put the weapon away. You're making people nervous.
Crush the spirit from Logrolf's bones. Make him bend to me.
Damnit! Why can't Ulfric see he's tearing Skyrim to pieces?
Did you need something? A staff? Some enchanting materials?
Do you... do you feel all right? You look very, umm, green.
Does it involve sneaking and stabbing? Ooh, please say yes!
Don't forget to check inside the shop if you need anything.
Dwemer ruins. The people under the mountains. All gone now.
Enmon, dear, do you have any regrets? About letting her go?
Falmer patrol up ahead. I don't think they know we're here.
First the war and now there's talk of dragons. What's next?
Firstly, the ability to repel the undead cannot be ignored.
Found another one of those vents in back near the scaffold.
Frankly, whoever keeps taking them down should get a medal.
Give my regards to Tonilia. Tell her I'll contact her soon.
Glad Orthus was able to find someone competent to help out.
Go away. I have more important things on my mind right now.
Good. You're finally here. The Jarl's been waiting for you.
Grelka! Lower your voice before you get us both in trouble.
Haelga, I like you, so I'm only going to say this one time.
Have you spoken to the Temple of Mara, yet? I'm so excited.
He came from the ancient homeland and killed all the elves.
He he he... Crazy? Cicero? He he he he... That's madness...
He would never have willingly parted with it. What a shame.
Heart of thorn... bones of the wild... in life, Forsworn...
Helgen... destroyed by a dragon. Hard to believe, isn't it?
Hello again, friend. I'll never forget what you did for me.
Hello, my friend? What can I do for you on such a fine day?
Here, then, is the first of the Illusion spells you sought.
Here, this is fresh. I'll have another meal ready tomorrow.
Hero of the Nords I name you, Dragonborn, let none deny it.
Hmm. Maybe in a few seasons I could afford such a treasure.
Hmm. Yes. They are very protective of me. Bahlaan fahdonne.
Hmmm... You can go, but you stay on your best behavior now.
Hope you're willing to back those words up with your fists!
Horses are all I know. I've been riding since I could walk.
How are the necklaces selling, my wife? We could make more.
How can we? We're a community of farmers, not fighting men.
I always thought the new Harbinger would be taller, myself.
I am as my father Akatosh made me. As are you... Dovahkiin.
I am one of them. A werewolf. It's my secret, and my shame.
I believe he was suggesting their presence causes him harm.
I brought in my cousin Cosnach to help me handle shipments.
I continue to hear things about dragon sightings in Skyrim.
I could brew some potions for you. Or train you in Alchemy.
I don't know why I expected even-handed treatment from you.
I don't like being made a fool of, Brand-Shei. Not one bit.
I don't like taking orders from a boy, but I need the gold.
I don't think it's safe mining a cave on top of that crypt.
I don't think we're going to get those potatoes to come in.
I envy you, outlander. You can choose to leave if you wish.
I have no problem killing you. How do you feel about dying?
I only just got my hands on it. I can only work so quickly.
I promise you, I buy much more than simple silver trinkets.
I saw guards dragging bodies over here. Might be a way out.
I see you're back from Dawnstar. Beitild lies dead, I hope?
I shall inform you the moment something noteworthy happens.
I should very much like to see you try it, my dear steward.
I still don't know if rewriting the verse is going to work.
I suppose I can come with you for a short venture. Lead on.
I thank you. And may Kynareth's soft rains fall before you.
I think Brynjolf can give you all the information you need.
I think I've discovered more here than I could've hoped to.
I understand you purchase used goods, as well as sell them?
I understand. If you should change your mind, I'll be here.
I wish I could afford to pay you both, Narri.  I really do.
I'd hardly call them a Guild. More like unorganized rabble.
I'd love get one of those Imperial weasels under my boot...
I'd rather not talk about my daughter, if you'll excuse me.
I'm afraid your bargaining without the metal to back it up.
I'm Ainethach's right-hand man. I help supervise the mines.
I'm doing as you asked. This is for some good purpose, yes?
I'm not asking you to defy the Jarl, just to open his eyes.
I'm not going into the mine with draugr lurking down there.
I'm not going out there. Not with that dragon on the loose.
I'm not going to talk to you until this mess is cleaned up.
I'm sure Jarl Ulfric does not expect something for nothing.
I'm surprised that the College is allowed to excavate here.
I'm surprised you succeeded. Please accept this as payment.
I've been scrying and auguring to find the murderer myself.
I've had several wives. But each dies sooner than the last.
I've told you, we can't talk out in the open. Come with me.
If Erdi caught me chatting, I'd never hear the end of it...
If it is our lot to end, we'll live in song if not in soul.
If it were to somehow end up in my hands, I wouldn't argue.
If that business proposition includes smuggling, forget it.
If there's anything you wish to purchase, just let me know.
If those Whiterun guards can take down a dragon, so can we.
If you're looking for potions, I think I can be of service.
If you're thinking of applying, talk to Viarmo in Solitude.
In some ways, yes, but there is often opportunity in chaos.
Iron's a good, stout metal. A fine thing for a Nord to dig.
It don't matter what I grow - my Alvor, he'll eat anything.
It ended the war and saved the Empire to fight another day.
It may be worth attempting contact with Malacath after all.
It seems I will never take my rightful place as High Queen.
It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what he has to say.
It's just children playing, Haran. I wouldn't fret over it.
It's no easy thing to make a living in the wilds of Skyrim.
It's not like there's anything to do here but drink anyway.
It's not often I get visitors out here. You lost, stranger?
J'zargo is going to stay right here until this is all over.
Jarl Ulfric! What is that thing? Could the legends be true?
Judgment has not been passed, as you had no way of knowing.
Just one more thing the Gray-Manes want to blame on others.
Just turn around and leave the city. That's the smart move.
Keep up the effort, young one. Eyes on the horizon, always.
Like I said. It got hot and smoky. Now it's cold and quiet.
Lookin' to shatter records or bones? My beasts can do both.
Malacath blesses us with this land. It's not for your kind.
Malborn? Ah... very good. I think we understand each other.
May the sun keep you warm even in this land of bitter cold.
Maybe you could talk some sense into my pig-headed brother.
Maybe you should look for work instead of begging for coin.
Men who understand each other often have no need for words.
Mining is tough, but Mul says the money is good so we mine.
Mortal. I give you my mace, in all its rusted spitefulness.
My family were in the Mythic Dawn. My museum is our legacy.
My job is my life. Whatever happened before doesn't matter.
My men will not attack you, if you will lower your weapons.
My nose and mouth are so full of dust, I can hardly breath.
Need to stay focused in case Frey comes back, make it fast.
Never thought I'd be running the store. I'm not used to it.
No fighting just yet. Not till Skjor says so. We train now.
No he isn't! He's the enemy, and we are going to crush him.
No matter. You'll take care of things like you always have.
No need to explain, I'm well aware of your Guild's methods.
No time for idle chatter. Mercer is awaiting your presence.
No, it.. it can't be. I haven't heard that name in decades.
Not so fast, there's a matter of residence to be discussed.
Now I can show you the source of the nightmares. Over here.
Now I suggest you turn around and go back the way you came.
Now I'm here to study Conjuration. That's what's important.
Now if that don't answer your question, then no words will.
Now we can rest in peace once again. Come Fjori, my love...
Now you let me know if you need a cure... or anything else.
Now you won't forget to tell Mercer I cooperated, will you?
Now, do me the honor I deserve as your father and drink up!
Now, how would you like me to align the Phial's properties?
Now, now my dear. I'm talking about academia, not politics.
Now, then, boy. Helgen was destroyed? How did you get away?
Now, who was it that kidnapped the Jarl's son 20 years ago?
Oh dear. Darkwater Crossing needs medicines for its miners?
Oh really? Well I think your new helper here needs a guide.
Oh Reyda! Redya! You live among the clouds now, dear Reyda!
Oh, I'm a good keeper of secrets. Have to be, in this hall.
Oh, if I had my full power, granting that would be trivial.
Oh, if you're worried about me trying to meddle with you...
Oh, right, they said you were captured crossing the border.
Oh, right. That makes sense. Kind of a messy metal, anyway.
Oh, we've got other things in mind for our mouths, sweetie.
Oh, you're back? I suppose you'll be wanting your pay then.
One of the new servants? Remember that I like my meat rare.
Orgnar. I'm travelling. You've got the inn 'til I get back.
Perhaps a more... tempered reaction... might be called for?
Perhaps when you're finished here this evening, we could...
Perhaps. At least it will continue to exist. Grik los lein.
Please my lord, can you spare a gold coin for an old woman?
Please take this on behalf of all the brothers and sisters.
Please, don't just let it stay like this. It's disgraceful.
Please, stop wasting my time. You're embarrassing yourself.
Poor Pavo and Gat. To have lived through a Forsworn attack.
Really? That seems hard to believe. You're sure about that?
Remember the passphrase: [QUOTE]Silence, my brother.[QUOTE]
Results speak volumes over words and you've just proved it.
Rulindil, pah! One day, the shoe will be on the other foot.
Rumor has it they can get you anything for the right price.
Save me a lot of trouble. Here. Take it to the Blue Palace.
Set an ambush on the road between, or camp one of the inns.
Should you prove him guilty or innocent, I will reward you.
Show up these Imperials for the foreigners they really are.
Sibbi's been spreading lies about me, you must hear me out.
So this is how you defeated Alduin. Ruth... zu'u ni Alduin.
Someone stop this fool sorcerer before someone gets killed.
Someone was attacked in the market. Do you know who it was?
Something arcane. Very old, very powerful. Do you think...?
Something is creating an incredible amount of interference.
Sometimes I think we deserve these miserable lives of ours.
Sorry, but I'm not looking to hire any more crew right now.
Spoken like a true Nord. I'll stand beside you, Dragonborn.
Step lightly. Who knows if those things can hear us or not.
Take a look around. Have you ever laid eyes on such wealth?
Thank Mara. I was afraid I'd never be able to convince you.
That s'wit. One day, he'll regret pushing all of us around.
That should be all right. How much space were you planning?
That's right, it's time to wake up, you drunken blasphemer!
That's what this lesson is for. Perfect time to try it out.
The Bunkhouse isn't an inn. I'd recommend the Bee and Barb.
The gate's unlocked. You can head inside when you're ready.
The god Arkay was once like us, bound to winding mortality.
The Legion will regain control of this city. Mark my words.
Then come for me, [QUOTE]son of Skyrim.[QUOTE] Come for me!
Then I commit them to whatever gods they still believe in. 
Then you've salted it and nothing will grow at all. Genius.
There are so few pleasures in life as fine as your company.
There are wonders in this place I never dreamed imaginable.
There is one... Yngvar. He's quite popular with the ladies.
There's beauty here unmatched in all of Skyrim, to be sure.
These parties are a great way to earn a little extra money.
They say that Karliah murdered Gallus, but I'm not so sure.
They're at Mistwatch. Here, let me show you on your map....
This is it! Time to see what these Stormcloaks are made of.
This is your chance, Dovahkiin! Strike with all your force!
This woman is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?
Those little girls of yours are growing like weeds, Lemkil.
To worry about the hereafter means losing sight of the now.
Tolfdir as Master Wizard. Certainly didn't anticipate that.
Vvardenfell's Red Mountain erupts. Try to be precise, Jorn.
Watch your mouth with me you pup! Who do you think you are?
We haven't much time for discussion, but what did you need?
We need nothing from outsiders! Yamarz will provide for us.
We taught that dragon not to mess with Whiterun, didn't we?
We'll talk later... after this whole ceremony thing's over.
We've been here so long and what do we have to show for it?
Well done. And it would seem I owe you something in return.
Well put, friend. Tell me, Galmar, why do you fight for me?
Well then you'd better have something I really want to buy.
Well, I guess Margret isn't around to complain. It's yours.
Well, perhaps that is why you're merely an Apprentice here.
Well, thank you for bringing it I suppose. Have a good day.
Well, then he's welcome to eat and drink at home, isn't he?
What are you, some kind of barbarian? Don't care for armor?
What brings you? You have the look of purpose in your eyes.
What in the world was that racket? Is everything all right?
What would Hroggar say if he heard I was drinking with you?
What, what is this? Is this what he really thinks about me?
What? That flower-chewer's died? Then let me out. My tower!
What's she doing? Looking for rubies in rubbish? Get a job!
When I find that bitch, I'm going to wring her little neck.
Who are you? What brings you to my strunmah... my mountain?
Why do they need me to do this?  We use magic, not weapons.
Word of advice if you ride a Narwhale. Mind the pointy end.
Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job, lad.
Working in Windhelm is great. I get to see Ulfric up close.
Yes, my lord. Summon me again, and I shall have your stone.
Yes, of course! But how to force a dragon to talk to you...
Yes, yes. My staff, take it. Kill something pretty with it.
Yes. I have something a little different planned this time.
You are brave. Balaan hokoron. Your defeat brings me honor.
You ask me, not enough of Winterhold fell off into the sea.
You ask me, we'd be better off without that wizard in town.
You come up to me, fists raised? You looking for a beating?
You didn't die. A battle you live through is a great honor.
You don't belong here. What do you think you have to offer?
You don't put up with a man like that. He puts up with you.
You have piqued my curiosity, however. Please, do continue.
You made it? I was sure I'd find you face down in the dirt.
You really should be more careful with the spells you cast.
You there. If you're here to trade, step up to the counter.
You try and set one foot in this yard, and I'll cut it off.
You understand? They left me for dead. I didn't leave them.
You... you know the Whispering Lady, don't you. I can tell.
You... you're in charge here until I can sort this all out.
You'll have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in my right ear.
You're not planning on burning anything with that, are you?
You've changed, brother. And not for the better I'm afraid.
You've done a great service for me and my city, Dragonborn.
You've returned. Good. What did you find at Wolfskull Cave?
Your muscles ripple when you work the forge. It's pleasing.
Your path now follows his, though you will arrive too late.
Your rewards in life will match the strength of your faith.
...Cicero is hungry... ...need a sweetroll... or a carrot...
A man like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.
Aduri, how come the fields haven't been tilled like I asked?
After you talk to Brynjolf and Mercer, come back and see me.
Ah ha! So you're a student of theoretical applied harmonics!
Ah, here's the blushing bride now. Let's begin the ceremony.
Ah, now that's a fine shield. And not mere Dwarven... is it?
Ah, yes. Well, I'll be sure and stop by the Arcanaeum later.
Ainethach's dead, but that doesn't mean we can stop working.
Ainethach's in charge of Karthwasten. You should bother him.
All of a sudden, the ghost disappeared. What happened to it?
All right men. On me! For the Emperor! For his Legionnaires!
All right, get that armor on and give that axe a few swings.
All that talent will go to waste when I'm finished with her.
And here I figured you as one who enjoyed our special gifts.
And lose out just when the going is getting good? No thanks.
And we show up to solve problems if the coin is good enough.
And what if... What if there are things guarding this place?
Any day now more draugr are going to come out of that crypt.
Any idea how I can get my daughter's head out of the clouds?
Anyway, much appreciated. Here, take this for your troubles.
Are you serious? I hear more threatening words from my wife.
Are you serious? I say more threatening words to my husband.
As far as Goldenglow Estate goes, I'll tell you what I know.
As long as you continue to make us all rich, I'm behind you.
As was destined, you are free to use my Star as you see fit.
Avulstein, put that down! He's here to help us find Thorald!
Back to business, Proventus. We still have a city to defend.
Be careful. The Forsworn are just as dangerous as they look.
Because big, bad Brynjolf doesn't like the way I play thief.
Bolli is a good man, he pays us well and watches out for us.
Brings back memories. Do you have any orders for me, Legate?
But first, tell me. Why's a Breton want to fight for Skyrim?
But first, tell me. Why's a lizard want to fight for Skyrim?
But that is for the gods to decide. You have done your part.
But this is only a small part of their power. Zofaas suleyk.
Buying one of our blades wouldn't hurt your chances, though.
Can you pay attention to work for once, instead of your mug?
Can't say I blame you. I'll find someone to take care of it.
Come on. If someone misses me at the party, we're both dead.
Conquering paranoia should be a snap after that ordeal, hmm?
Could it really be?  Wow this is what I've been looking for.
Curses aren't enough, now must I suffer you too? What is it?
Damn outsider. Why couldn't you just mind your own business?
Damn that Loreius. Oh, how he will pay for this treachery...
Did you see that madman? A Forsworn agent. Here in the city.
Do the Falmer also have no sense of smell? This place reeks!
Do well here, and you'll be a full member of the Companions.
Do whatever Yamarz asks of you. It cannot make things worse.
Do you agree to be bound together, in love, now and forever?
Do you ever get tired of the long days on the farm, Mathias?
Do you hunt? The plains outside Whiterun are ripe with game.
Do you think the ghost is one of... Tiber Septim's dead men?
Don't like those eyes you got. There's a bad hunger to them.
Don't take this the wrong way, but you look a little sickly.
Don't want in, huh? Fine. Have a good walk to the next city.
Dragons, thieves and war. I should have stayed in Morrowind.
Dreary, dank, and dimly lit. Truly a Sanctuary to call home.
Elda, honey, let's not talk about the war. It's in the past.
Eola is a fine host. She really keeps the faithful together.
Exploring these caves feels like coming home. I missed this.
Falkreath's cemetery reminds of us that war is not new here.
Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us, boy.
Few want to be reminded of mortality in a time of war, Kust.
Fine. If you can't pay with coin, you'll pay with your life!
For the love of Talos, shut up and let's get this over with.
For the privilege of entering the city. What does it matter?
Fort Hraagstad is one of the few that remains mostly intact.
Get moving. I'll see if I can't delay any patrols out there.
Gianna will be overjoyed to meet you. She's in the kitchens.
Go on ahead. I'll be sure and catch up with you before long.
Good news. I found that dwarven hammer you were looking for.
Gralnach! I told you not to go through your father's things!
Great! Thanks! Bastard stole from me. I'll catch him though!
Hard to believe I ever complained about Riften being cold...
Hard to believe there'd be an old crypt underneath the mine.
Has everyone here forgotten their training? Kill that thing!
Have you... Do you see that future? Will I be a good leader?
He is pleased. Ours is the strongest tribe in all the Reach.
He was very nervous, mentioned something about needing help.
He won't say a word to me, but I don't know how I upset him.
He's just a guard captain. And not a very good one, at that.
He's okay. A little breathy and a little harsh on the notes.
Here, your reward as promised. You have Winterhold's thanks.
Here's to friendship. A gift! If you don't like it, too bad.
Here's your shiv. Promise you won't ever use it on me, okay?
Hern and I do so adore guests! These guards are such a bore.
Hmm, it's encrypted.  It'll take a while to figure this out.
Hmph. Pity. I had hoped to obtain even a modicum of justice.
Honestly, I can't keep up. But by all means, don't stop now.
How dare you. No one turns down cut meat from Hogni Red-Arm!
How long have you been in Skyrim? Yes. Give the man my axe. 
However, it was my sword piercing his heart that killed him.
Hroggar's house? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
I admit, there is strength in numbers. Perhaps between us...
I am Burguk's mother and wise woman to our tribe, outlander.
I am here to assist those seeking the wisdom of the College.
I believe this gem is worth more than you are at the moment.
I don't know what he's doing, but he won't get away with it.
I don't suppose we would ever really trust the thing anyway.
I don't understand. This should produce some notable effect.
I fear the night. Because the werewolves and vampires don't.
I got something for you. But you'll have to come and get it.
I guess that'll teach me to try to reason with a Stormcloak.
I had to get this for you when I saw it. I hope you like it.
I have a special task for whichever of you is left standing.
I have Alva to take care of now. I don't need Helgi anymore.
I hear Mauhulakh is wandering again. He's after a new woman.
I hear your crops sold well at the market. Well done, Ennis.
I hope that dragon isn't still flying around here somewhere.
I know who you are. You've been terrorizing the entire city.
I may fall to your malice, but your fate is already written.
I served as a healer in a fort not unlike this one long ago.
I think we can trust Karliah. Let's see what she's on about.
I thought you said these things were [QUOTE]sleeping[QUOTE]?
I warn you, Gray-Mane, you are treading on dangerous ground.
I will not drag my honor through the mud for you, or anyone.
I'll be at the market come morning. You better be there too.
I'll never understand why you're so bitter about everything.
I'm afraid to touch half of the things we keep in the tower.
I'm always glad to help a friend if I can. What do you need?
I'm going to examine the body before the rats can get to it.
I'm Thongvor's steward now. Every coin in this city is ours.
I'm warning you now, this challenge will be quite difficult.
I've been waiting for Roggvir's execution. Talk to me later.
I've been waiting for someone more fit to carry out my will.
If fought more than my share of bandits in places like this.
If he does show up with a bride, we'll have to move quickly.
If I had anything worth giving, I'd have offered it already.
If it's horses you want, you're talking to the right person.
If it's work you're looking for, Hulda's the one to talk to.
If that's taken into account, these results make more sense.
If they do, we'll send them crying back to their boss again.
If you are honorable and strong, then I can call you sister.
If you get a chance, kill a few more bears for me, will you?
If you have business, please see Falk Firebeard, my steward.
If you're going after the claw, you'll need to know the way.
Illdi. What year did the Aldmeri Dominion invade the Empire?
In the mountains to the northeast. I'll mark it on your map.
Is it good fortune? The blessings of the Divines? Who knows?
Is... is someone coming? Is that you Harknir? Bjorn? Soling?
It bothers me that fewer people come to Windhelm these days.
It is no matter, this fool will be the next act of the show.
It is when my customers waste time chatting, and not buying.
It's a blessing given to the most honored of the Companions.
It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what she has to say.
It's good to be back in High Hrothgar after all these years.
It's okay, dear. More work than ever down at the blacksmith.
It's time we made this official. You ready to take the Oath?
It's wonderful to be able to sleep soundly, don't you think?
Jarl Black-Briar. I must admit, I do like the sound of that.
Just my luck, stuck in the sticks with this crazy old woman.
Just please, don't harm anyone. I couldn't bear the thought.
Karliah and I had a long discussion before you arrived here.
Keep clear of the College, and keep yourself out of trouble.
Leave me be, Imperial. I haven't got anything to say to you.
Let me know if you need a drink. That's what we're here for.
Let's clear the place out first. Then we'll gather our loot.
Let's get to the Forsworn camp. Her life could be in danger.
Let's get up there before mother finds out what we're doing.
Let's hope it's as powerful as the Psijics believe it to be.
Let's see if I can teach you a few things about using a bow.
M'aiq hears many stories of war... yet few of them are true.
Malacath blesses this land for the Orcs. And the Orcs alone.
Malacath demands much of us now. We will not fail him again.
Master Arngeir, are you going to just let him continue to...
Maybe Adelaisa will finally ease up, but I expect she won't.
Maybe I'll hold off and go another day. Get some rest first.
Mercer's holding something over his head, keeping him loyal.
Mind your step. I think I spied a patch of ice on the floor.
Mind your tricks, wizard. No need for someone to get hurt...
Mind yourself with that fire. Don't burn anything down, now.
Money, you laggard! What else? It always comes down to coin.
Most bandits are cowards. These seem to be braver than most.
Must you bother me now? I've almost figured out where it is.
My darling, you've made me the happiest woman in all Skyrim.
My family has served Skald Felgeif's family for generations.
My family thanks you. Take this as a token of our gratitude.
My job's simple enough. The dead don't really complain much.
My lord Alduin requires your death. I am glad to oblige him.
My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone.
Never mind then, lad. If you change your mind, come find me.
No, I'm not. Looks like we've got something in common, then.
No... for pity's sake... I've already told you everything...
Not a comrade yet, but a friend. I owe her my life, in fact.
Not a comrade yet, but a friend. I owe him my life, in fact.
Not much. But as a bard, I find the whole affair depressing.
Now go, my friend. Go, and fulfill your destiny as Listener.
Now now, fella. Let's not get too close to my new bride, eh?
Now that's what I like to see. Someone who gets things done.
Of course not! Thieves take what is precious. Thieves steal.
Of course, Lucan. Of course. I was just, well... Never mind.
Of course. And I'm sure it's mostly for ceremonial purposes.
Oh dear. I wish there was something we could do to help him.
Oh, if you see Shadr, remind him he still owes me that debt.
Oh! And look, I even have the payment I owed. Here, take it.
One of them's escaped, and you're going to find that coward.
One should never pay too much attention to rumors, Torbjorn.
Otherwise you can try the Jarl's wizard. I wouldn't, though.
Papa may have wanted a son, but he got me. He's a lucky man.
Perhaps I'll join the Legion one day, as my father had done.
Perhaps, but abuse is abuse. I don't think I could stand it.
Please address all questions to the Steward, Falk Firebeard.
Please, I need help! I don't want to die on this damned log!
Please, visit me at my home. I can tell you the whole story.
Return anytime you need arms or armor. My forge never rests.
Riverwood's agreeable enough, I suppose. For a Nord village.
She's our only child, Boti. Am I to throw her to the wolves?
Since the Stormcloaks took over, Jarl Thongvor is in charge.
So I found something. Here. Take it. I think you'll like it.
So you can cast a few spells. Am I supposed to be impressed?
So, have you shown those furry menaces that I mean business?
So, I've been hearing your name in court quite a bit lately.
So, Maven wants to hunt down Sabjorn's private partner, huh?
Someone's got to head out there and take care of the beasts.
Somewhere in the ice fields, if you want to try to find him.
Sorry if my father seems a bit distracted. A lot's happened.
Sssssh! That's not something we want everyone to be hearing.
Stay clear of that College, if you know what's good for you.
Stay within the boundaries and only use the practice arrows.
Steady. I don't know what's happening. Let's watch and wait.
Step aside Galmar. We're here to accept Ulfric's surrender. 
Thank Her Benevolence it wasn't burned like the other tomes.
Thank the gods. I'll get to work on the Phial straight away.
Thank you for helping my Aunt, earlier. I'll see you around.
Thank you for this. I have a great deal of work ahead of me.
Thanks for taking the time. People never want to talk to me.
Thanks for warning me. I'll see to it this is taken care of.
That iron sword's pretty undependable. You should try steel.
That way it was always ready for the next inevitable victim.
That would be a fair price. When you've got it, come see me.
That's all right, grandmother. I like staying home with you.
That's what I've spent my twilight years trying to find out.
That's what you did, isn't it? Absorbed that dragon's power?
The boss is going to cut those creepy cave people to pieces!
The decision whether or not to help you is not mine to make.
The forge is strong and so is our chief, Larak. I'm content.
The Mercy of Stendarr does not extend to Daedra worshippers.
The smoke woke me up. It was hot and I was scared, so I hid.
The Stormcloaks want freedom but don't understand its price.
There are stories about you, and dark tidings in Dawnstar...
There are strange echoes in these caves. Keep you eyes open.
There's a clear spot just west of Riften. You know the area?
There's no shipments coming in, so I do nothing. Just drink.
There's only the pommel left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?
There's still plenty of ore left in that mine. What a waste.
They squander their father's love. We can't dally this time.
They want this as much as you do. Perhaps they want it more.
This is why so few follow it, and why the world is as it is.
This one thinks you should be more careful with your spells.
Those green apples you sold me the other day were delicious.
Too bad you don't have that much. Guess you'll have to walk.
Treasure, that's what! Get off your scaly rump and let's go.
Two things I have for you. Two shapes. One edged, one round.
We are all up to something, my dear. All is as it should be.
We are honored to have you as Thane of our city, Dragonborn.
We are used to the cycle of gain and loss. It is no trouble.
We don't sell any imports from Summerset Isle, do we, Lucan?
We don't take kindly to people snooping around our business.
We got the message... now just take your business elsewhere.
Welcome back to the Prawn. Let me know if you need anything.
Welcome back. I've left a few surprises for you to discover.
Welcome to Mistveil Keep. I'm Jarl Laila's steward, Anuriel.
Welcome to the Pawned Prawn. Come on in, take a look around.
Well, if it isn't the bully that goes around hurting people.
Well, it just so happens I have the perfect mission for you.
Well, you know the old saying. When life gives you lemons...
What about you, Festus? How did that last contract turn out?
What are you gawking at? Can't you see I have problems here?
What could be worth studying about a long-lost civilization?
What is my freedom worth, if the price is my brother's life?
What my daughter sees in that... barbarian, I'll never know.
What's this? Oh, that's right, the timbers from Anga's Mill.
When you're able to draw a bow all the way to your shoulder.
Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job, lass.
Yeah, I don't know how I feel about what goes on down there.
Yeah? Well, I got news for you; there's nothing to see here.
Yeah. Follow my wife's orders, and don't do anything stupid.
Yes, just a brief overview of our facilities. Are you ready?
Yes. He was an absolute genius when it came to the nirnroot.
You cannot prevail against me. I will outlast you... mortal!
You haven't heard any more about dragon sightings, have you?
You know how children are. Her fancies change with the moon.
You look tired, friend. The Bannered Mare has beds for rent.
You must be the new unblooded. Welcome to the fight, sister.
You need a reliable horse in the Reach. That's what we have.
You need anything, anything at all... don't hesitate to ask.
You should take more care, leaving things lying about. Here.
You treat a horse well, it'll take you to Oblivion and back.
You wouldn't think it from the racket that Cornerclub makes.
You... you have my statue! What are you going to do with it?
You're a well-traveled sort, I can tell just looking at you.
You're getting pretty good at this dragon-fighting business.
You're here! I was beginning to think you might not make it.
You're leaving? Okay, we'll just work on the verse in a bit.
You're looking hale and healthy. It's good to see you again.
You're no liar. Best fight I've had in years. There you are.
You've been exploring places you shouldn't, and you know it.
You've betrayed me, murdered my sister and massacred my men!
You've done what you've had to for yourself, not for mother.

*Sigh*... and that's the last one. All right, enough of this.
A buxom barmaid between the sheets will keeps me plenty warm.
A dragon! How exciting! Where was it seen? What was it doing?
A few hours sleep and we should be ready to continue through.
A friend, huh? Well... then it's probably okay if I tell you.
A wise decision, but I fear he may not be safe there anymore.
Absolutely no time to deal with lowlifes these days. Go away.
Addvar won't sell anything if I don't go and check up on him.
After that, Ulfric... there will be a reckoning. Count on it.
Again? Didn't we teach you enough of a lesson the first time?
Ah wonderful, I knew it would be. This is a significant find.
Ah yes, Sarthis... a thorn in my side for the last few years.
Ah, it's one of the infamous Nordic puzzle doors. How quaint.
Ah, there you are. I was wondering when you'd visit us again.
All this knowledge might have been lost, were it not for you.
Am I going have to beat it out of you? Is that what you want?
And obviously you have Ulfric, the Jarl and future High King.
And so, perhaps, your destiny will be fulfilled. Who can say?
And why would I... Oh. Oh! Guards! Guards, I need assistance!
Are you looking for help with something? This is a busy time.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather explore, say, a nice tavern?
Are you sure? I doubt you stand a chance against the Thalmor.
Are you... threatening me? Walk away fool. It's not worth it.
As always, lord, your loyalty is a shining example to us all.
As in all things, Lord, caution... I urge us to wait and see.
Assorted fruits and vegetables, all delicious and affordable!
At last. It is over. Perhaps it was all worth it, in the end.
Avulstein, put that down! She's here to help us find Thorald!
Aye, and some of what Karliah said is starting to make sense.
Ba ba ba, bum ba, ba ba ba, bum ba, ba da da da, dum da da...
Be careful, friend. This place doesn't seem too... forgiving.
Be careful, there's no telling what lurks within these walls.
Be cautious, the pilgrimage to the Shrine is not an easy one.
Because getting rid of the Empire was only half the problem. 
Best if... you didn't mention to anyone that you saw me here.
Beyond this gate is the first step in becoming a Nightingale.
But I honor your courage. Krif voth ahkrin. Die now, in vain.
But it seems you have no intention of dealing fairly with me.
But nothing a band of Stormcloaks can't handle, I assure you.
But you went there, didn't you? Isn't that where you learned?
Can you? You have the power of the Voice? Now I'm interested.
Careful. Our footsteps will echo in every chamber and tunnel.
Carry on, soldier. This is all part of the Dragonborn's plan.
Come by the Winking Skeever any time you want to hear a tune.
Come on! We need to get inside before that dragon comes back!
Cowards! We must kill the vampires. We have to make them pay!
Did I hear right? Did he say you were to lead the Companions?
Divines bless you. May the ground you walk quake as you pass.
Do be careful, child. Skyrim is not as safe as it used to be.
Do forget to see me at my shop sometime - Arcadia's Cauldron.
Does it look like I can move? You have to cut me down, first.
Don't bother me if you haven't found anything about the mask.
Don't go talking about that. Only the dinner guests can know.
Don't say that out loud. Not here. And the answer's still no.
Don't sound so eager, it's not a social visit. It's business.
Dragons aren't just coming back, they're coming back to life.
Dumping bodies and keeping the guards quiet can be expensive.
Exactly. For the Guild to survive, they need Maven's support.
Excellent, I needed some more kindling for my kitchen hearth.
Excellent. And now, please accept this token of appreciation.
Fair enough. You can have her. She's the one with the saddle.
Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us, girl.
Father, could you clean up the house a little while I'm away?
Fight well, and I'll make sure your corpse is not dishonored.
Fine weapon, but you wouldn't mind putting it away, I'm sure.
Fine, then. I guess some Dunmer are content to be their pets.
For Falkreath and I this is just one more war in a long line.
Funny, I'd have thought she would've gone back to him by now.
Good. And you'll have a chance to prove it to me soon enough.
Good. Good. Now we won't have to spend time searching for it.
Good. Maybe things will be different around here from now on.
Got business here in Riverwood, eh? There are worse villages.
Got to be a sword or two in one of these chests. Look around.
Great Malacath, we beseech you, aid us in our time of need...
Greetings outsider. If you have some business here, speak it.
Have you considered that Alduin was not meant to be defeated?
Have you met my father? He's the steward, up at Dragonsreach.
He has something special planned for you. Better talk to him.
Helgi. But father says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
Help me get out of here, and I'll help you find them. Please!
Here, take this small token of appreciation for your efforts.
Hey! There you are, you drunken bastard. I did it, so pay up.
Huh? Oh. Sure, whatever. I prefer Dibella's teachings myself.
I believe Brynjolf wishes to speak with you. We're done here.
I better stay back and see to the old man. Good luck you two.
I didn't mean to imply I was earning an honest living either.
I don't go down easy if you raise your hand against me again.
I don't know Bolli. It's getting dangerous outside the walls.
I don't know how you talked the Jarl into this plan of yours.
I found a big load of ebony at the bottom pocket in the mine.
I gave you what you came here for, now go. Leave me in peace.
I haven't heard even a scratch at the door. Have you done it?
I hope that when I die, I don't end up as a shambling corpse.
I hope you haven't arrived here looking for work in the mine.
I hope you're not expecting to get paid until the job's done.
I just cook, and clean, and do whatever it is they ask of me.
I just need to rest a moment, right here on this lovely rock.
I keep searching for some hope of Sovngarde, but to no avail.
I knew, that day, that it was truly the beginning of the end.
I know you, Ulfric. You have no intention of coming to terms.
I see. You're a good soldier, Horik. I'm sorry for intruding.
I serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary. Life is simple, and good.
I shall write your name upon the Tablet of Absolute Darkness.
I simply must have this! I'll pay you double what it's worth.
I still need someone to practice a few spells on. Interested?
I think I've got a handle on it, but Orichalcum is confusing.
I told you to go away. I'm not opening this door for anybody!
I told you what you wanted to know. What else could you want?
I trust this is the last I'll hear of your violent outbursts.
I trust we'll never need to speak of this again... to anyone.
I want you to go with Irileth and help her fight this dragon.
I won't be able to relax until I'm sure Potema is dealt with.
I would gladly retire from the world were such a day to dawn.
I'd rather have two bottles of mead then two wenches, friend.
I'll bring you everything we have on them, but it's not much.
I'll give you something to cry about if you don't quiet down.
I'm afraid I have absolutely no idea what you're speaking of.
I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone.
I'm aware of that, Bolgeir, and I appreciate your dedication.
I'm bored standing around, papa. I could take over for you...
I'm going to check the entrance to the Ratway. Be right back.
I'm just here to work the mine. Nothing else matters anymore.
I'm not building a ship, sir. I'm trying to make things grow.
I'm not sure that's a good joke to tell with women present...
I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for this. Move along.
I'm still busy, but I can always make time to speak with you.
I'm too old to work, but that don't make me too old to drink.
I've been at Arnleif and Sons all my life. It's a good store.
I've been in Skyrim my whole life. Why would I want to leave?
I've been thinking about building that cabin we talked about.
I've got what I came for, I better get back to Dragon Bridge.
If I get any rest soon, I'll count myself richer than a king.
If there's anything I can help you with, you have but to ask.
If there's ever any way I can assist you, please let me know.
If this place is in danger ever again, the shadows will call.
If you are honorable and strong, then I can call you brother.
If you don't find him soon, he'll return, stronger than ever!
If you have spare weapons and armor to sell, bring them here.
If you're here to join the Stormcloaks, the palace is inside.
If you're looking for supplies, I'd advise heading to Riften.
If you've need of weapons or armor, come back and see Oengul.
Imedhnain, I was just comparing the ledgers from last season.
In the meantime, I'll see about figuring out what went wrong.
Interesting... They know more of our plans than I expected...
Is that so? Lost your uniform along the way did you, soldier?
It involves a recipe for a liquid known as Vaermina's Torpor.
It is good to finally know that Malacath has not forsaken us.
It was a truly terrifying scene. Beautiful, in some respects.
It's a curse! It has to be! I've got to get out of this town.
It's all here. Well, congratulations. You're one of us again.
It's an old family. Very well-respected throughout the Reach.
It's got to be somewhere around here! Now where did I put it?
It's my wife, Fjola!  I think she's being held in this tower.
It's probably not a good idea to walk around naked like that.
It's quite fetching actually. The craftsmanship is excellent.
It's through these subtle means that Nocturnal influences us.
Jorleif, I want you to send a messenger to our western camps.
Just say the word, and my men will help you spring this trap.
Just stay close and let me do any talking, got it? Follow me.
Keep your eyes open in the barrow... that's how they get you!
Khajiit are not known as mages, so J'zargo has much to prove.
Knowing a Word of Power is to take its meaning into yourself.
Let's just not take the chance. We can talk about this later.
Lets see how tough you are without Sam keeping an eye on you.
Look at those ruins. How long have they stood here, I wonder?
Look silly! As if you could look any sillier than you do now.
Look, I assure you, this is all just a huge misunderstanding!
Look, I don't think I should say. I mean, they could kill me!
Makes Narfi very, very sad. Narfi needs Reyda to say goodbye.
My daughter Adara is also my apprentice. She's a quick study.
My Erith has her father's eyes. She's all I have left of him.
My husband just gets cranky when he doesn't get enough sleep.
My older brother took me out hunting a lot when I was little.
My problem with her? She's the one who has a problem with me!
My wife Beitild is dead. Can't say I miss that old sabre cat.
Narri! This mead tastes like water and the meat has gone off.
Neat weapon. You're not going to hurt anybody, though. Right?
Necromancy, as any other type of magic, is a tool to be used.
Never mind then, lass. If you change your mind, come find me.
New in town? You're lucky. Dreams aren't affecting travelers.
No you're not. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?
No? Then how do you like the idea of having your legs broken?
No. I think if I was a young man, I would have done the same.
Not too shabby. Apprentice level work, but solid. Keep at it.
Nothing but the best. Black-Briar Mead... fresh from the vat.
Nothing like a good adventure or romance to lose yourself in.
Now please do be careful. Who knows what we're going to find.
Now that they've been dealt with, we need to find the Torpor.
Of course. That's your choice. I just wanted to let you know.
Oh, don't listen to her. We can do it, just give us a chance!
Oh, don't listen to him. We can do it, just give us a chance!
Oh, I doubt that very much. Who would load their ships, then?
Oh, of course! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that it's not.
Oh, yes. All the time. They come with the visions, as always.
Our newest members are housed here in the Hall of Attainment.
Outsiders aren't trusted in Markarth. Best keep that in mind.
Perhaps you could spare a tomato for a priest of the Divines?
Please hurry -- I fear my master doesn't have much time left.
Raerek, how is The Reach faring against this Forsworn menace?
Ranmir beg a drink from you, yet? That's gold wasted, friend.
Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion!
Really? Good show. Here, take this. You know, as a thank you.
Respect the law, and you'll have no trouble in Dragon Bridge.
Secret, though. Official Synod business. Can't talk about it.
Seemed like the best way to see the world and make some coin.
Seems friendly enough. Obviously intelligent. Why do you ask?
She always said composure was the key to a successful archer.
She was a young woman... buxom, with long flowing black hair.
She's okay. A little breathy and a little harsh on the notes.
Should have figured the little lunatic would completely snap.
Sinding. Came through as a laborer. Seemed like a decent man.
So it's true. That traitorous bitch! Morthal owes you a debt.
Some other time? That's not going to help me much, now is it?
Sometimes I miss being out there in the middle of the action.
Sorry to have bothered you. I'll just be out of your way now.
Spices? I'm certain I have no idea what you're talking about.
Steel your nerves. The draugr are gone. Focus on your mining.
Step towards the block when we call your name. One at a time.
Stop moping about, girl. Tears won't change what you've done.
Svari, yes. It's been hard on her. The girl misses her uncle.
Take this. You've done a good thing for the Riverwood Trader.
Taking on Potema won't be easy. But you are the one to do it.
Tell him to finish the preparations, the Festival is back on.
Thank you. When I find my daughter, it will be thanks to you.
Thanks again for delivering those supplies to the Greybeards.
Thanks for clearing out that vampire nest. You saved Morthal.
That pig? Oh, I have info on him. More than you care to know.
That thing's evil, Lynly! I told you to keep away from there!
That'll teach me to try and make extra coin around this city.
That's a lie! My legionnaires are disciplined, unlike your...
That's not necessary. I'll pay the same price as anyone else.
The cemetery is ancient. It's been here longer than the town.
The degeneracy of the Empire is on display here in this room.
The Greybeards are so afraid of power that they won't use it.
The interrogations are quite merciless, from what I've heard.
The Jarls weren't asked. We were told. And we had to like it.
The Legion could really use someone like you, especially now.
The life of adventure and song is the life for us, eh friend?
The Old Hroldan Inn is still open, bless poor Eydis's memory.
The who? I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Then I swoop in and take over the place. No more competition.
There hasn't been a true High King in Skyrim for generations.
There's plenty more where that came from. Just give a holler.
There's two kinds of Pit fighters -- good ones and dead ones.
They say a dragon attacked Helgen. Sounds like hogwash to me.
They'll think twice before coming back here, that's for sure!
This is all very strange. I've never seen anything like this.
Those Thalmor are elves, too. I bet they're working together.
True, but I'm not going to be the one to try to oppose her...
Trust me, marsh-friend, you do not want to live in this city.
Try it out? What would you need a leather harness for anyway?
Ulfric Stromcloak's head rolling away from his lifeless body.
Um, thank you. Sir. Was there anything else I can do for you?
Very well, let's meet this evening and make the arrangements.
Vex better leave a piece of Mercer for us. It's payback time.
Warrior, good! Those stars will guide you to honor and glory.
Watch your back, friend. Better yet, pay me to do it for you.
We have a cozy little profit. Here. This is your share, love.
We hold each other close and hope that all of this ends well.
We'd better keep moving. Who knows what that dragon is doing.
We're almost there. I can hear the Lexicon. Come on. Quickly!
We've all heard that one before, Bryn! Quit kidding yourself.
Welcome. I'm the owner and proprietor of Honningbrew Meadery.
Well come back when you do, my friend. Come back when you do.
Well done, indeed. Please accept this as a sign of my thanks.
Well done. I wasn't certain you'd even know what to look for.
Well said! You may be fighting on the wrong side in this war.
Well, ain't gonna find her here. Haven't seen her in a while.
Well, some tools that aren't rusted through would be a start.
Well, you send that blowhard to me if he steps over the line.
What did you just say? All I heard was the sound of jealousy.
What do you want now? You still hurling baseless accusations?
What do you want? Aren't your hands coated with enough blood?
What do you want? Haven't you done enough damage to Markarth?
What do you want? There's no words left to say to each other.
What is this feud you have with your wife? What started this?
What some call devotion to the dark arts, I call foolishness.
What'd you say to me? Get out! I never want to see you again.
Where in Oblivion are we supposed to go? Where's the way out?
Why don't you lay down and rest, while we get the meal ready?
Why not let me run the Skeever? I already know lots about it!
Why the Elven blade, hmm? Nord steel not good enough for you?
Why would anyone want to kill her? It doesn't make any sense.
Why's someone like you want to hang around a place like this?
Will you spare a few coins to help someone who's got nothing?
Would you two shut up before Brurid hears you messing around.
Yes, I'll be ready in a moment, I just need one more thing...
Yes, I'm going with you and together we're going to kill her.
You always keep us in mind when you need a fresh horse, yeah?
You bring that back to your lovely mistress. With my regards.
You can go back and forth all you want, he just needs to pay.
You couldn't possibly be the Dragonborn of legend. Could you?
You did? Thanks. I get you the rest of your coin by tomorrow.
You don't look like a pilgrim. Why bother visiting Ivarstead?
You gotta have better things to do than talk to me all day...
You have the claw. Oh, you have to tell Lucan at once. Hurry!
You have the Jarl's confidence, friend. And so you have mine.
You here for my next interrogation? I got nothing but time...
You just better hope this one isn't another waste of my coin.
You might try there, if you can get through the Ratway alive.
You must be the new unblooded. Welcome to the fight, brother.
You must present your invitation to be admitted to the party.
You seek meaning, shelter in Knowledge. You will not find it.
You should leave. I don't want you scaring off my good death.
You should see Gharol if you're looking for a blade or armor.
You should speak to the Jarl if you need something, stranger.
You slaughtered them - the women, the children! You butchers!
You won't get anything out of me, you filthy sons o' horkers.
You'd do well to remember who's really in charge around here.
You'd think so, wouldn't you? I'm fine. Thank you for asking.
You'll come of age soon. Time to be married to another chief.
You're abandoning me? Me? I never want to see you ever again.
You're needed in Winterhold. Report to our hidden camp there.
You're the one who put out the fire in the Lighthouse, right?
You've caught me at a bad time. I've lost someone dear to me.
Your spirit is strong. Kynareth's winds will guide your path.
A dragon in Dragonsreach. That's something I never saw coming.
A dragon? That's... ridiculous. You aren't drunk, are you boy?
A jester. In these parts. Man must be completely off his tree.
A little bit of old Reach magic can cure whatever ills you....
A pleasure to see you as well, Niranye. What can I do for you?
A storeroom. See if you can find any potions. We'll need them.
A woman like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.
Ah, so they've finally sent someone to deal with that lunatic.
Ah, Thonar, don't you worry. Nana Ildene isn't going anywhere.
All right, that's enough. Let's return to our business please.
All right, Wilhlem. I suppose it's the least I can do for you.
And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, my good lady!
And he's not just any dragon. He was the right hand of Alduin.
And if the meadery is profitable, I get rich. Get the picture?
And what about the dogs? How are those precious little angels?
Another girl killed. This is Susanna, from Candlehearth Hall. 
Another poem, I'll bet. He does know how to make a girl blush.
As always. The Nords don't ever stop wanting things enchanted.
As I've said, a donation of 250 should help take care of that.
As short as life can be in this land, we will have each other.
At last... the final Totem is ours. Let's go complete our set.
At this rate, the Guild won't be such a laughingstock anymore.
Be careful, Niluva is a bit... aggressive when she's cornered.
Be glad you're not training under me with that mouth of yours.
Behold the Skull of Corruption, the source of Dawnstar's woes.
But first, tell me. Why's a Redguard want to fight for Skyrim?
But mind he bard, Mikael. Poncy little milk drinker, that one.
But Volunruud... that I have heard of. And I know where it is.
But you're not out of the woods yet! Get it? Out of the woods?
But, give me... just a moment... I must gather a few things...
Can't do that and keep an eye on things here at the same time.
Careful. Riften's not the safest place for a nighttime stroll.
Changed your mind? Ready to find out the truth about Markarth?
Come and see me again sometime. I might have some use for you.
Come in, come in. Mustn't speak of these things in the Ratway.
Come on. I'll feel better once we're under cover in Riverwood.
Congratulations on your wedding. I'm so happy for both of you.
Delphine! I... it's good to see you. It's been... a long time.
Did you ask Mirabelle? She runs things around here, after all.
Do not delay. Alduin will be coming. He cannot miss the signs.
Do take care handling that case of wine... it's irreplaceable.
Do you have any family? Anyone waiting for you on the outside?
Don't forget. You find Queen Freydis's Sword, I'll reward you.
Don't judge Dengeir too harshly. He is old, but he means well.
Don't just walk away from me! Where do you think you're going?
Don't mind them. Just working out some issues, in the old way.
Don't say that to loud, you don't want it getting back to him.
Don't start any trouble and I think we'll get along just fine.
Don't worry though. It'll be relatively painless...relatively.
Don't worry, it will all be waiting for you when you get back.
Done. Convince him to stay out of the city while you're at it.
Driven out of my own home. After all this, I can't believe it.
Endon, dear, please don't.... Save your frustrations for work.
Even just one should be enough for me to complete my research.
Everyone on me. Let's show these Imperials what we're made of!
Everything seems to be working out nicely, wouldn't you agree?
Excellent. I think you'll be glad that you made this decision.
Excellent. Once again, you've proven yourself a born assassin.
Excellent. Thank you, I'll see that this gets put to good use.
Faralda's working on something, and I want to know what it is.
Father says I ain't smart enough to be stablemaster. Some day.
Fine, but there's a whole crypt of draugr underneath the mine.
First, let's count the coin, then we can get back to business.
From Faendal? That's strange. He's never written to me before.
Go now, the artifact must be reclaimed and Malkoran destroyed.
Go now! The orcs could breach the inner sanctum at any moment!
Gracious! This one is certainly unaccustomed to such sights...
Ha! Clearly, we should have killed that old bastard years ago!
Hadvar's alive? I hope that's true. He's a damn good soldier. 
He knew everything about the ancient dragonlore of the Blades.
He's here and he hasn't seen us yet. Brynjolf, watch the door.
He's not a werewolf any more? Even dead? This is a good thing!
Hemming, have you dispatched that letter I gave you yesterday?
Hemming, I want you to personally supervise the next shipment.
Hey, I cut you into the deal. There's nothing else to discuss.
Hmm. Very well. I'm putting my reputation on the line for you.
How dare you speak of the Thalmor in such a disgusting manner!
How did you get it? No, never mind, I probably shouldn't know.
How does a knife in the gut sound? It's 200 gold or your life.
I could also do some good for a change. Sure, I'd go with you.
I demand that you leave at once and never speak of this again.
I did not come all the way here just to walk out empty-handed.
I don't know. Whenever those Silver-Blood men decide to leave.
I don't like this place. It feels like we're being... watched.
I don't like wizards and their spells. Give me an axe any day.
I don't understand it either. They were a sure thing, I swear.
I doubt the Empire has the stomach for much more bloodletting.
I got no quarrel with you, but I won't turn one down, neither.
I grew up tending some of these horses. They're almost family.
I have meals to cook for the entire castle and almost no help.
I inherited the store from my husband. His father was Arnleif.
I just need to hire one, maybe two good men. You won't starve.
I know you had some part in Sinding's escape. Don't deny it...
I know, master. Don't say such things -- there is always time.
I never expected Ulfric to live up to his legend, but he does.
I presume you refer to Ancano's distaste for the Psijic Order?
I said [QUOTE]a free meat pie[QUOTE]. As in one. Here's yours.
I suppose congratulations are in order. Now don't screw it up.
I suppose so. I just fear they won't make it out here in time.
I suppose so. Seems like it was just turning summer yesterday.
I suppose there's no point in concealing the truth any longer.
I think you dropped this! Good thing I brought it to you, huh?
I understand your hesitation, but I promise you that it works.
I will return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary immediately, Listener.
I'm a Forsworn. One of our raids went bad, and I got captured.
I'm glad to be out of that place. I hope this leads somewhere.
I'm just trying to make a living. I've no interest in trouble.
I'm looking for a necklace. Do you have anything with garnets?
I'm not sure. Just... Well, mind what you tell him, all right?
I'm told that you're up to something out in the marsh, Falion.
I'm very dangerous! Don't make me come out there and hurt you!
I've been holding onto this for you. Here! I hope you like it.
I've got a bad grip on my shield, could you take a look at it?
I've thought about it, but I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
I've told you before, and I'll tell you again. Leave me alone.
If I'm really lucky, I'll get to kiss the bride for good luck.
If it isn't the best brawler in Skyrim. Good to see you again!
If it puts your mind at ease, I'll take it with me. I'm sorry.
If it's about the Hall of the Dead, no, you can't go in there.
If only Camilla shared my affections. Or even knew about them.
If Ulfric wants to challenge my rule in the old way, let him. 
If you have need of tonics or potions, come see me at my shop.
If you ladies are finished bickering, there's much to be done.
If you need some skulls crushed, I'm still available for hire.
If you want something a bard can dig into look to the dragons.
In the meantime, why don't you have a chat with Legate Rikke. 
It'll be good to not have to hear him whining about his debts.
It's cold in the mine, but Thorgar really needs me, so I stay.
Just stay away from me and I'll forget we had this discussion.
Keep your wits about you and watch your shield brother's back.
Let me just drop everything to help you. I don't mind. Really.
Look. You're making my customers nervous. Put the weapon away.
Luckily for you, I've already made the mixture. Here, take it.
Many used to come to these caves. The forgotten. The wretched.
Maro is dead, I know. But we've got bigger problems right now!
May the gods speed your journeys... and steady your sword arm.
Maybe the order has something to do with the Symbols up there.
Maybe there's something on the claw itself that could help us.
My friend Marex. We were hunting, and I thought he was an elk.
My son, Olur, learns the forge well. His work brings me pride.
New sister. May I offer my most sincere welcome to our Family.
Nice to have a new face around. It gets boring here sometimes.
No, he means to ambush us down here, I'm almost certain of it.
No, you don't want to go up there! A dragon... it's attacking!
Not a day goes by I don't ask that question myself, my dear.  
Not at all. I consider it an investment in prolonging my life.
Not at all. It's good to be put in your place once in a while.
Not just the men. The Greybeards seem to think the same thing.
Not now, you idiot. We'll talk after this ridiculous ceremony.
Now if ya don't mind, my house could do with a bit of dusting.
Now leave me to my sleep. My strength and patience are waning.
Now, empty your pockets or I'll pick the gold off your corpse.
Now, Ralof, what's going on? You two look pretty well done in.
Oh, but that's where you're wrong, lad. Wealth is my business.
Oh, by all means. Just leave your refuse wherever you see fit.
Oh, excuse me. With my uncle gone, things are a bit of a mess.
Oh, no. Nothing like that. You're calling on her for business.
Oh, wow! That was just sitting there? I wish I found it first.
Oh, you are terrible. You do know that, right? Ha ha ha ha ha.
Okay! Let's play hide and seek. You find me and I'll tell you.
One more reason to pray for the fighting to end then, my love.
One thing everyone can agree on. This war is bad for business.
Otherwise you could talk to the Jarl's pet wizard in Solitude.
Outlanders should learn to not wander where they don't belong.
Pardon the mess. We're really trying to do better around here.
Please come back if you're ever in need of fletching supplies.
Please hurry, we need to catch Mercer before he leaves Skyrim.
Please remain indoors at night. It is dangerous to go outside.
Please, do look around. I'm sure I have something you'll want.
Please, I beg you, don't tell Sibbi where I am. He'll kill me!
Please, reconsider what you're doing. Maybe I can pay later...
Rum from Hammerfell, mulled wine from Daggerfall and the like.
Seriously, you don't know? That was Ulfric Stormcloak himself.
Shout for us, Dragonborn. Then we may have time for questions.
Skjor says it was more like forty, but he's just being modest.
Some of them might try. But that's not what I'm worried about.
Someone's after me I tell you. They're watching me. Somewhere.
Sorli and I are just here to make sure the mine is run proper.
Stay out of the Black-Briars' business and you'll live longer.
Stendarr's Mercy be upon you, for the Vigil has none to spare.
Stick around! Still plenty of songs to sing and mead to drink.
Stop! We know you're holding a Daedric artifact. Hand it over.
Takes a lot of strength to swing a pick axe, know what I mean?
Tekla! It's good to see you, girl. How's Dengeir treating you?
Tell me again, why I'm wasting men chasing after a fairy tale.
Thank you for your trust. I am eager to return to my homeland.
Thank you so much. The festival has really increased my sales.
Thanks. It would be nice to have it back... means a lot to me.
That, and a true Nord never misses a chance to test her worth.
That's all right. Return to me if you change your mind though.
That's all! I'm a nobody, really. So can't you just let me go?
That's between you and Maven and I prefer to keep it that way.
That's nice, son. Just don't stomp on the crop like last time!
That's right. It isn't yours. You're under arrest, Brand-Shei.
That's why it's best to not mistake foolhardiness for bravery.
The dagger...? By Akatosh, they didn't even wrap it correctly?
The fewer of these mines we venture into, the happier I'll be.
The ice entombs the heart. The bane of Kagrenac and Dagoth Ur.
The prophecies are clear. Only the Dragonborn can stop Alduin.
The security in Whiterun is terrible. Shameful, is what it is.
The thought of the dead rising... makes me sick to my stomach.
The way they walk, what they're wearing. It's a dead giveaway.
The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter's curse.
There are no shipments scheduled today. Stop covering for him!
There could be Draugr about, I can smell the decay in the air.
They laughed at me again, Dinya. They simply don't understand.
This is a place for warriors, new blood. What brings you here?
This man has endured, has challenged, and has shown his valor.
This thing from Saarthal. What does it do? J'zargo cannot say.
This'll teach you not to take things that don't belong to you!
Thought you might be open to doing it again... for a tidy sum.
Traveling in the Reach is dangerous. You need a good carriage.
True... we could simply make sure she never reaches Narzulbur.
Unless you've come to pay a ransom, turn around and walk away.
Until you're done with Vex, we don't have anything to discuss.
Vampires are clever hunters. More clever than you, definitely.
Very few are permitted to study with us here at High Hrothgar.
Very well, just let me know when you have the necessary funds.
We got everything in hand here. You aren't needed 'round here.
We had this same argument every week, even when you were Jarl.
We must return to the Sanctuary! Your Family is in dire peril!
We welcome you to worship the Nine Divines, freely and openly.
We're running out of bread. I hope the supplies get here soon.
We're the only Temple in Skyrim that can openly worship Talos.
We're trusting you on this one. Bring honor to the Companions.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Bear pelts.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Wolf pelts.
Well met, Brand-Shei. I've come by to browse your wares today.
Well, boy, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint.
Well, no. I'm just saying there's more to defense than muscle.
Well? I won't fight you, so we may as well get this over with.
What are you gonna do if I don't? Huh? Gonna cry to your papa?
What does this look like, the Temple of Mara? No gold, no bed.
What glorious prey. Come back alive, and with stories to tell!
What if I told you about a large shipment of gold and weapons?
What's wrong, Brynjolf? I can almost hear your brow furrowing.
When your friend told me, I didn't believe it at first either.
Where? I would never... ah, I see. You are a fellow enchanter.
Whoa. Hope you know what you're doing with those flames there.
Why don't you come back when you actually have a hundred gold?
Why in the world would this be sealed off? What is this place?
Will I need to talk so loudly with my wife when I get married?
Winterhold belongs to Skyrim, not the Imperials, or the Mages.
Wish to converse with the crazy old elf, eh? Very well. Go on.
Woodcutting's my trade. Best log splitter from here to Riften.
Work hard, now! The pride of Iron-Breaker Mine is on the line.
Working in the Treasury House isn't so bad. I earn good money.
Would you like me to send someone? Faralda or Phinis, perhaps?
Yamarz has demanded we stay inside the walls. We cannot leave.
Yamarz is proud, and refuses to see that we need outside help.
Yes, but there are concerns. Rumors that he's up to something.
Yes, you were going to demonstrate your ability, were you not?
Yes. I earned the right by slaying my father in single combat.
You blind, boy? I'm a blacksmith. Any half-wit could see that.
You bother me again, maybe you will not walk away. Understand?
You can't argue with these mages. They'll attack you on sight.
You continue to amuse and impress. Go forth, with my blessing.
You don't think there's any hope, do you? I don't. He's right.
You feel fear for the first time, worm. I see it in your eyes.
You from Daggerfall, Breton? Fleeing from some court intrigue?
You from one of the strongholds, Orc? How did you end up here?
You have returned. Will you now aid me in contacting Malacath?
You know this one? I saw her training in the yard with Vilkas.
You know this one? I saw him training in the yard with Vilkas.
You know what? I think I do know the guy you're talking about.
You look a bit peaked. You sure you shouldn't be home, in bed?
You look kind of scary. But nobody is scarier than old Grelod.
You never were able to see the forest for the trees, were you?
You really shouldn't be in here, but I guess since it's you...
You said the city was safe, now. How could this have happened?
You stay away from my family. Or you die. Be smart. Stay away.
You want answers? Well so do I. So does everyone in this city.
You! You're going to hurt me again aren't you? Just stay away.
You'd never think to learn from a Nord like the Jarl's wizard.
You're leading and I'm following. Does that seem clear to you?
You're mean. I hate you. I hate you forever and ever and ever.
You're right. It's what he wanted, and he deserved to have it.
You're right. Tullius isn't in any position to ask for Riften.
You're wrong! Sibbi and I are in love and you're just jealous!
You've been even-handed so far. What do you say to our demand?
Your corpse will feed my spiders for weeks. Now die, you fool!
...need to get Mother some flowers... pretty, pretty flowers...
[QUOTE]...Jarl of Windhelm and true High King of Skyrim.[QUOTE]
A few drinks, a few laughs and a contest. What could be better?
A guest? In the kitchens? You know this is against the rules...
Ah, freedom. Now get out of my way. I have a task to attend to.
Ah, well I guess it was unlikely. I'm sorry to waste your time.
Ah, you're a smart woman. That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
Alftand. The point of puncture, of first entry, of the tapping.
All at once! You're efficient. I like that. Here's your reward.
Although not interested enough to keep me from being locked up.
Amazed isn't the right word. They might find this... offensive.
An old storeroom. Grab anything you can, but let's keep moving.
And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim.
And I've figured out where the next one will come back to life.
And if you want to keep having ears, you'll pretend you didn't.
Are you a relative of one of the Riften dock workers, Argonian?
Are you so sure of that? I think Birna might disagree with you.
As a consequence, I have no knowledge of what you'll be facing.
Astrid... By the sands, I still can't wrap my head around it...
At least I've chosen a side instead of acting like a spectator.
At least we don't have a dragon to worry about, for the moment.
Bah. Another honest man lost in all this madness. And for what?
Been married many times, but the gods keep taking them from me.
Begone, serpent! Begone from this house and trouble it no more!
Being friends with the bartender's son has its advantages, huh?
Beyond that I seek only to be left alone to pursue my research.
But first, tell me. Why's a foreigner want to fight for Skyrim?
But I have nothing to hide. I'm in from the south, on business.
Can you believe the company won't even dock ships here anymore?
Can't believe I'm posted here. Even the beds are made of stone.
Can't believe we let provincials like you wander around Skyrim.
Come along, no more stops, we need to find our way to Solitude.
Come to gloat, have we? To poke fun at the jarl's youngest son?
Come, Karliah. It's time for you and Gallus to become reunited!
Damn Forsworn. Only a matter of time before they hit here, too.
Dark times, indeed. I fear the worst for Morthal and my people.
Do not be afraid. Faasnu. Let me feel the power of your Thu'um.
Do you think Ancano knew all along what the Eye was capable of?
Do you think that dragon is still flying around here somewhere?
Don't be a silly girl! Running a bar's no job for a young lady.
Don't fret, my fanged acquaintance. I shan't trouble you a bit.
Don't get any ideas. We're here on official business, remember?
Don't take anything for granted in life. Nothing lasts forever.
Don't you ever find it demeaning, working for that Nord family?
Dovahkiin, vosaraan! Use Dragonrend before Alduin consumes you!
Easy there. The numbness will pass. Just don't strain yourself.
Elisif, are you really going to be a party to this foolishness?
Enjoying the hospitalities of the inn. Suggest you do the same.
Even the Greybeards must bend to the winds of change, it seems.
Everyone, please. I'm doing what I can to end these nightmares.
Everything here appears to be in order. You can move along now.
Everything's under control, then? Right. Keep up the good work.
Excellent. Put the fear of the Nine into those motherless dogs.
Follow me. I will show you how to open the path to Paarthurnax.
From the look of it, I'd bet it leads straight into the prison.
Get the job done and get back alive. That's all there is to it.
Getting the shakes, huh? All right. Take it. Old gods keep you.
Go right ahead. He just might be sober enough to listen to you.
Good job. Here, let me give you something for all the leg work.
Good. No killing, though. Don't get arrested. I won't help you.
Good. Then I think it's time we put your expertise to the test.
Got to admit, I find the Night Mother's presence... comforting.
Ha! I knew it! Had your name written all over it, that one did!
Ha! Now that I would like to see. I may go back there some day.
Have you talked to Brelas yet? I'm not a patient man, you know.
He is too strong on the wing! Bring him to gol with Dragonrend!
Here for a room or something to drink? Show me some coin first.
Here, take this. It's all I can offer for what you've given me.
Here, take this. This should cover your end of the work nicely.
Hey, it's our hero! Seen any more of those pirates around here?
Hmm... Yes, the silence suits you. Gives you an air of mystery.
Hmph. I was wrong about you. I see that now. Maybe we all were.
Horses. All day long. Do you have any idea how dull horses are?
How could I forget? That old alpha male almost took off my leg.
How could you forget? It was the sweetest story I'd ever heard.
Hrmph. Breaking a curse is not a simple thing. It is dangerous.
Hurry up and tell Lucan you have the claw. He'll be so excited!
I am charged with protecting the Jarl from any and all threats.
I assure you, the Dreamstride is well known in Vaerminian Lore.
I bet the wedding was amazing... and we missed the whole thing.
I can tell you're new around here, askin' a question like that.
I certainly hope so. I don't know how long we can keep this up.
I don't appreciate loiterers, if that's what you're here to do.
I don't know what he's talking about. He must be seeing things.
I feel the same. I do not think Khajiit were made for the cold.
I fought by your side. To take back the Reach from the savages.
I found out the Thalmor have him. And they don't let anyone go.
I get his messages, and I hand out his orders without question.
I hope he turns up soon... he needs to answer for his betrayal.
I hope we don't run into anything worse than Imperials in here.
I hope you enjoy touring the museum. Just don't touch anything.
I just try to keep out of the way when they start roughhousing.
I like the farm life. It's a huge change from living in a city.
I might be a woman, but I can crack rock with the best of them.
I must petition Malacath for relief. This curse must be lifted.
I should come along. I would very much like to see this dragon.
I should have been an adventurer like you, instead of a farmer.
I suppose I could make an exception. I do like her spiced wine.
I suppose you're here to extort something from me? Is that it? 
I understand you're the one that found this... Orb in Saarthal.
I want to check on Grani, one of our horses. Goodbye, stranger.
I want you to find that miserable little fool and end his life!
I was sent by Nepos the Nose. The old man hands out the orders.
I'd wager old Vignar could see half a dozen of my predecessors.
I'll admit, even I'm having a hard time disagreeing with you...
I'll see if I can't get some work done inside, where it's warm.
I'll start planning how best to spend this. You have my thanks!
I'll stay here and wait for General Tullius. Good luck you two.
I'm afraid my days as the steward of Riften has come to an end.
I'm not getting any younger. Let's get this ceremony done with.
I'm not opening this door, so you might as well leave me alone.
I'm not waiting to be killed by a dragon! We need to fall back!
I'm sorry, Betrid. I thought I had cleaned the tables properly.
I'm sorry. I don't think I can bare to sell anything right now.
I'm sure General Tullius does not expect something for nothing.
I'm sure he's learned his lesson. Let's try to enjoy ourselves.
I'm the innkeeper. It's my business to keep track of strangers.
I've got it right here. Just don't read it, it's not very good.
I've scouted the ruins and I'm certain Karliah is still inside.
If it's important, maybe Tolfdir knows. He seems to know a lot.
If Mercer leaves here with the Eyes, we'll never see him again.
If you have further need of me, you can find me in the College.
If you'll pardon the expression, she's far more bark than bite.
If you're looking for conversation, The Flagon isn't the place.
Irileth, you'd better gather some guardsmen and get down there.
Is it true? Did you really capture a dragon on the Great Porch?
Is there anything more revolting than spiders? Too many legs...
Isn't this something? Elenwen really knows how to host a party!
It was the only way I could make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap.
It's good practice. Most people barely notice what I'm playing.
It's true about the dragons returning. Saw it with my own eyes.
Just stay out of the Black-Briars' affairs. You'll live longer.
Keep back, citizen. I have important business I must attend to.
Keep looking. There's got to be some way to get that gate open.
Laelette was told to burn mommy and me, but she didn't want to.
Leave Idgrod and her family alone. They've been through enough.
Let me show you the operation, then you can ask your questions.
Like most of our band, I found this family after losing my own.
Look, I need to know. What's going on between you and Brynjolf?
Looking for a horse? You'll want to talk to my father, Geimund.
Lucan's got a little bit of everything at the Riverwood Trader.
Mara, I forgot how late it was. We'll need to lock up the shop.
Mercer? This is the one I was talking about... our new recruit.
Mulush, we need a break. The heat from the smelter is too much.
My first and only loyalties are to my nephew, and to this city.
My note? No, that's yours. Must have fallen out of your pocket.
My poor Fralia thinks Thorald's still alive, but I know better.
Never did find out why they came sprawling into town like that.
New brother. May I offer my most sincere welcome to our Family.
No, and after what you've discovered I fear the worst for them.
No, I guess not. Well, get out of here before I change my mind.
No, I'm not Arnleif. Yes, I know it's called Arnleif and Sons. 
No, please! There's no need for that! I'll tell you everything.
Nobody else has come up the south road today, as far as I know.
Nothing to do now but sit back, relax, and enjoy the trip home.
Now he's dead and gone and the Skyforge of Jorrvaskr lies cold.
Now let us turn our conversation away from such unpleasantness.
Now, so we're clear - this is the last time we talk about this.
Now, then. I been gabbin' long enough. Too much cleanin' to do.
Now, what's this nonsense about trapping a dragon in my palace?
Of course. But I can't just hand that over. Privacy, after all.
Oh yeah. Pretty little thing. Been sitting by the fire all day.
Oh, a new pamphlet from Dinya? I'll be glad to read it. Thanks.
Oh, but I will speak. I will speak to you. For you are the one.
Oh, but that's where you're wrong, lass. Wealth is my business.
Oh, Dorthe. You're breaking your mother's heart, you know that?
Oh, very well. I'll send my brother. He'll straighten this out.
Old Hroldan is the stone that the Empire's history is built on.
Once you find the courier's route, kill him and take his place.
Only reason Jarl keeps Anton on is because he cooks up a storm.
Or else what? You'll kill me? I already had to face that today.
Our Guild Master graces me with a visit. What can I do for you?
Our hadrimme, our minds cannot even... comprehend its concepts.
Please help me, I'm going to lose my job at the Riften Fishery.
Please, Listener. Release my soul, and let Sithis be the judge.
Private quarters are strictly off limits. You have been warned.
Put the thought out of your mind, and do not speak of it again.
Ready for some work or you just going to wander around all day?
Revenge is it? Have you learned nothing from your time with us?
Sadly, we never had the opportunity to speak about the details.
Should have known better than to swim all the way to the falls.
Skjor thinks you should find it, and I'm supposed to watch you.
Skyforge Steel is all the Companions will use, for good reason.
Skyrim was once the land of many butterflies. Now, not so much.
So I hear. You've brought honor to the Companions and yourself.
So it will be. Malacath has spoken, Yamarz. Your path is clear.
So that's how it's going to be, huh? Fine. Take your best shot!
So this is where Delphine has been hiding all these years? Hmm.
So. You were at Helgen? You saw this dragon with your own eyes?
Some of these Nords will come up with any excuse to despise us.
Someday all of Skyrim will worship Talos openly, as we do here.
Songs are just old memories that help the mead go down quicker.
Speak with Galmar. You'll be going on a little errand with him.
Spells and incantations for those with the talent to cast them.
Splendid! Please take a seat on the chair behind me, would you?
Stay alert. Never know when those Stormcloak dogs might charge.
Stop right there. The tower is off limits until further notice.
Stop, outlander. You must pay for your crimes in blood or gold.
Tell me, do you believe in mighty Arkay, god of life and death?
Tell you what. You start running so I can stab you in the back.
Thank you! I can promise you that this will be put to good use.
Thank you. Please, take these few coins, for services rendered.
That's right. Home of the Redguards. The land of sand and seas.
The catch is that you can't burn the whole place to the ground.
The Dread Father works through me. And his work has just begun.
The Empire is in shambles. They've banned the worship of Talos.
The ground is practically frozen. We can't dig down far enough.
The Riverwood Trader is everything you need in a general store.
The strong and honorable always carry the blessing of the Nine.
The thought of my wood being used for weapons... Makes me sick.
The war? That is not a reason to leave, it is a reason to stay.
There a reason you're walking around with an unsheathed weapon?
There isn't an inch of this building that I haven't cleaned up.
There may be some way to get through on the level above. Hurry!
There's a cave here. Bears if we're lucky. Trolls if we're not.
There's no need for an apology, and you're right about the war.
These fights are invite only. And you're not invited. Slag off.
These Imperials have potions in here. We're going to need them.
These thralls of yours are slower than Argonians in a blizzard.
Think maybe we should jump the guards when they come down next?
This ceremony is so different from an Orc marriage. Less blood.
This is an ode to Skyrim's staunch protectors... the Imperials.
This is it! Hold at all costs! Don't give them any more ground!
This one's a favorite of mine. A legend we all know and love...
This one's claws are ready for you should you assault me again.
This was their city once. They won't stop until we're all dead.
Ugh. That insufferable pup? Forget it. Request denied. No deal.
Umm... are you in trouble? Is that why you're hiding like that?
Very well, Talen. I'll remove myself from this den of iniquity.
Watch yourself on High Hrothgar, I hear wolves prowl the steps.
We sell bows, arrows and ale. A unique combination, to be sure.
We should get after Vals Veran before he does more damage here.
We welcome you to worship the Eight Divines, freely and openly.
We were stopped in Helgen when we were attacked... by a dragon.
Well, girl, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint.
What are you on about? Let's just get the treasure here and go.
What are you saying? You think I had something to do with that?
What is that stench? Rotting wood, perhaps? That can't be good.
Whatever is going on, whatever you're up to... Be very careful.
Whatever it is those Psijics are up to. They cannot be trusted.
When I go away, I go to war. That's no place for a little girl.
When I'm known throughout Tamriel, you'll regret this decision.
When people ask my real name, know what I tell them? Don't ask.
While there is no direct evidence of this, it does seem likely.
Will do. Don't stray too far away or else we'll come after you.
Will he cast aside the Imperial coin falling into his coffers? 
Winterhold. You want the College there. They teach quite a bit.
Yeah, but she was a Nord. And a noble. Perfect Forsworn target.
Yes, my mistress. Summon me again, and I shall have your stone.
Yes, yes, fine. Just hurry! Mustn't keep the customers thirsty!
Yes. The oldest and most powerful, although he may not seem so.
You are a traitor to the Empire, and deserve a traitor's death.
You blind, girl? I'm a blacksmith. Any half-wit could see that.
You can help us with that, and make sure no one else gets hurt.
You can try, but we've gotten nowhere talking to him ourselves.
You hear all this talk about a war? I hope it never comes here.
You hear any juicy gossip in town, be sure to share it with me!
You just let me know what you need. I am at your beck and call.
You like everyone Jorn. You'll make a good court bard some day.
You mean Ulfric's so-called [QUOTE]Stormcloak rebellion[QUOTE]?
You need advice? Talk to Brynjolf... I got better things to do.
You should head on inside. Eydis or Skuli can take care of you.
You speak truly. Have you heard any interesting rumors of late?
You want in there? Here's my spare key. Take whatever you want.
You would do that? That's great. You should go do it right now.
You, have a request of me, Bulfrek? This should be interesting.
You... You are not Aren, are you? Has he sent you in his place?
You'll die knowing it was the Blades that sent you to Oblivion.
You'll never compare to me, but I can try and teach you anyway.
You're a guest. And father says we have to be polite to guests.
You're right. Ulfric isn't in any position to ask for Markarth.
You've done it! The College is safe again, thanks to your work.
You've done well, to even get the two of them in the same room.
You've returned with my axe. I knew that would be his response.
...hear he's decided to let the Hags turn him into a Briarheart.
[QUOTE]Olaf's vengeance was instant, inspired and wicked.[QUOTE]
100 gold will secure my release. You can afford that, can't you?
A family of thieves. Running their corrupt empire from Markarth.
Ah, my dearest Urag! How are you today, my green-skinned friend?
Ah, so my reputation as a lover precedes me. Care to reconsider?
Ah, well now you can help me directly! Far more useful, I think.
Alduin believes that he will prevail, with good reason. Rok mul.
All the more reason then. The crown would legitimize your claim.
Always such a model for decency in these troubled times, Yngvar.
An Elder Scroll is an instrument of immense knowledge and power.
And here you are. I hope you've found the museum to your liking.
And we'll need to hand the city over to that Free-Winter fellow.
And when the coin dried up, that's when people started to leave.
And you, go sit on that damn chair and start acting like a Jarl.
Are you looking for a gift for a friend, perhaps? Or... a lover?
As a matter of fact, there are. Have you ever heard of Shalidor?
As for honor, well, there are some luxuries even I can't afford.
Aye, I see the look you're giving me. Don't worry, I won't bite.
Aye, the last thing we want to be doing is crossing our clients.
Be careful... we're certain to find more of the awakened within.
Because Tolfdir says so. He says there are things to learn here.
Before I let you into Riften, you need to pay the visitor's tax.
Being an apprentice is great. I get to swing a hammer at things.
Besides, you're the one having all of these visions, aren't you?
Break the law in Markarth, and it's off to Cidhna Mine with you.
Brunwulf. Yes, I've sent men to protect him and bring him here. 
Brynjolf's been looking for you about the Guild Master ceremony.
But willing or no, they will hear it! Fare thee well, Dovahkiin!
But you always say you want more girls in the bar to begin with!
By all I hold holy... Can it be true? Have you actually done it?
Come on. I don't want to hit you until you have your ward ready.
Damn him - the old bear was right! Did you run into any trouble?
Dengeir was a good Jarl in his day.  Even if his day has passed.
Doesn't mean anything to me. Got an unusual shine to it, though.
Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.
Don't worry, the time will come when we can walk away from here.
Don't worry, though. You will find all three Words in Ustengrav.
Don't worry. We'll take good care of your city when you're gone.
Even so, the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price.
Exactly. Together we stand more of a chance of making this work.
Excellent. You've done us a great service. Here is your reward. 
Forsworn attacks are bad enough, but those sellswords are worse.
Go back to Morrowind, Dark Elf maggots! You're not welcome here!
Good luck. Lucan and I will be waiting for you back in the shop.
Good. After I open the gate, please stand on the western circle.
Good. Maybe that will teach them to leave honest citizens alone.
Great.  Here you go. Come back later and I'll have other things.
Guards are free to search your room. Uh, just keep that in mind.
Guardsman! What happened here? Where's this dragon? Quickly now!
Guess we can't afford to miss that much work, can we? Oh well...
Haafingar seems to have trouble keeping their prisoners in line.
Hasn't been seen for a while. She just vanished without a trace.
Have it your way. I'll take the job, but don't expect a miracle.
Have the books, do you? I mean, I'm very glad. That's wonderful.
Have you seen my mother? I'm still waiting for her to come home.
Here. It isn't much, but... I hope it's the thought that counts.
Hey, that's my lint! Ha, Cicero is just joking. You can have it.
Hey, when you make up your mind, just let me know. I'll be here.
Hey! I know. The Jarl's wizard could teach ya. He's lots closer.
Hey! You planning to steal something? Don't even think about it.
Hi! I've never seen you around here before. Are you a miner too?
Hmm... Blades, helmets. Pretty much anything to suit your needs.
Hmm... They know more of our plans than I thought... Not good...
How kind. At my age, I've certainly learned how to spend wisely.
How many Nords died to save the Empire? And what was our reward?
Huh? What are you talking about? I don't even know what that is.
Huh. Lot of old guys around. I don't really know how I can help.
I am an Orc and a warrior, but I have no desire to become chief.
I can. Here. This is fresh. I'll have another one made tomorrow.
I can't, Valindor. It won't let me go. It's taking over my life.
I don't blame you. If I were in your shoes, I'd chicken out too.
I don't fight Lars no more, if that's what you're worried about.
I don't know how you made it this far, but you'll go no farther.
I don't know, my darling wife. I assume you're going to tell me?
I don't suppose you could come back another time? I'm very busy.
I don't want a trail of dead bodies leading here. Keep it clean.
I fight for the men I've held in my arms, dying on foreign soil.
I get the message. Here, take your gold. I hope you choke on it!
I have an old cure for Rockjoint. Common in little Orc children.
I haven't seen him in many years. I wonder what became of him...
I knew we could count on you! Glad to have you back on our side.
I may consider it. But you must first do a service for my glory.
I return from the war to find my home overrun with bandit filth.
I spill just a bit of metal, and Mulush takes it out of my hide.
I still can't hold nothin' down, but it's better than yesterday.
I tell Thonar I can only smelt what Nepos and his miners dig up.
I trust that you'll inform me as soon as the Staff is recovered.
I understand Korir's been complaining about our customers again.
I used to fence for the Thieves Guild in Skyrim a long time ago.
I want to be an adventurer like you, but my father says I can't.
I will serve Gularzob as best I can, even though I am his elder.
I will stay right here and wait for you to bring me what I need.
I... I'm not sure. I think perhaps, but I don't know what it is.
I'd be a lot warmer and a lot happier with a bellyful of mead...
I'll be handling the horses with Cedran gone. Miss that old man.
I'll be happy to assist you if you'd like to purchase something.
I'll come to your council. But I doubt any good will come of it.
I'm afraid your skills haven't improved enough to be considered.
I'm Captain Aldis. I'm here to help you take down these bandits.
I'm disappointed to say I've learned little during my time here.
I'm glad you decided to come with me. We're almost to Riverwood.
I'm here to mine, outlander. So unless you want to dig, get out.
I'm in charge of the smelter. Not you. So why don't you lay off?
I'm not a scholar, Esbern. How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not seeking advice right now, friend. Just send the message.
I'm on my feet all day. Can you please do this one thing for me?
I'm sorry about my housekeeper. She's a little protective of me.
I'm sorry. I just don't feel up to entertaining anyone just now.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Elsweyr.
I've a little of everything for sale, come and see for yourself!
I've already made it very clear that all of my trades are final.
I've had enough troubles recently. What is it that you're after?
I've scraped this collection together by whatever means I could.
If anything pleases the eye, don't hesitate to make me an offer.
If it's bed or board you're after, Candlehearth Hall's got both.
If that's all, there's pressing concerns that need dealing with.
If they do, promise you'll actually purchase something for once.
If you like. But we need to find a way to unlock that trap door.
If you say so. If this were anyone but you I would lock them up.
If you want to help, you'll need something to cut into it first.
If you were getting them from my farm, they'd be twice as fresh.
If you're looking to join up, Kodlak's the one to be talking to.
In fact, there is. I need a soul gem filled, if you're up to it.
It flew over the town and landed on the old dragon burial mound.
It is difficult to admit, but J'zargo could still use some help.
It means when I have troubles, I always have someone on my side.
It takes a while to make a dress, Dagny. You have to be patient.
It was always just before dawn. The whole world was in darkness.
It was you, wasn't it. I should of known better. Now look at me.
It's good that Sorli has finally been given some real authority.
It's only a matter of time before Ahtar's blade finds my neck...
Jonna, do you think the townspeople are warming to my serenades?
Just a reminder, sweetie - the blankets still need to be washed.
Just give me a few more days and I promise I'll come up with it.
Just keep your ears open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine.
Keep droppin' these jobs and I might quit assignin' them to you.
Keeping this place secure is as simple as breaking a few spines.
Know any tales of nobility and courage? I'm keen to record them.
Kynareth gives life, and we need a living tree to be her symbol.
Let us sleep, sweet Arkay, by your side. Let no harm come to us.
Like I said in my note, I've heard that you might be Dragonborn.
Look at these stones. The ancestors knew how to build, no doubt.
Look, if you're in some sort of trouble, I could talk to Haelga.
Lucan's dead. I guess I'm in charge of the Riverwood Trader now.
M'aiq does not remember his childhood. Perhaps he never had one.
Mara's mercy, then he's safe! Come on, we have a lot to discuss.
Maven. How's the criminal underworld treating you this fine day?
Maybe we could spend a little bit more and buy some meat, Endon.
Maybe we'll meet in the field. Just pray we're on the same side.
Mom says the Empire is mean, but I don't think they're that bad.
Mother wants me to work at the mill. But I ain't nobody's slave.
Much snow in Skyrim. Enough snow. M'aiq does not want any more. 
My ancestors are smiling at me, Imperials. Can you say the same?
My children all grew up and left Dawnstar to make their fortune.
My cousin's out fighting dragons, and what do I get? Guard duty.
My little girl. Always strong. Do you know where you have to go?
My nephew has always been handed things, even the title of Jarl.
My people believe it to be cursed now. Who am I to gainsay them?
Need your weapon repaired? Or could I interest you in a new one?
Nice to finally meet someone who can follow simple instructions.
No idea. Maybe he got tired of getting stung by these damn bees.
No offense, but you're not looking so good. Are you feeling ill?
No, the dragons are merely the final portent of the End of Days.
No! Roggi and Kjeld need some more support timbers for the mine.
No. No, I'm quite sure I have no idea what you're talking about.
Not many people care, these days. The world is the worse for it.
Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as elf, but as dovah!
Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as orc, but as dovah!
Now... Well, let's just say the front door doesn't get much use.
Od - Ah - Viing. [QUOTE]Winged Snow Hunter,[QUOTE] as I read it.
Oh if only I could provide more than this coin. I hope it'll do.
Oh, hey there. I killed a bear yesterday. Did you kill anything?
Oh, yes! Quite! So many important people from all across Skyrim.
Oh... yes. Now that you mention it, I think... sorry about that.
Okay, okay. Just trying make this place a little less... boring.
On the plus side, he also refuses to acknowledge Ulfric's claim.
Once again, the Empire takes the blame for the crimes of others.
Our daughter. Our little girl. She hadn't seen her tenth winter.
Our men know how to kill Forsworn and Legionnaires, not dragons.
Our wedding is soon, under Mara's loving eyes. It'll be perfect.
Perhaps before the end you will earn the right to pass this way.
Please be careful, I don't wish to be the reason for your death.
Prisoners smuggle the stuff in. Only currency we have down here.
Really? You're certainly... forthright about your criminal past.
Redbelly Mine gets its name from the red mist filling the place.
Rescue? No one knew where I was, when I was taken. Who sent you?
Return when you've defeated the guardian wolf, crab and skeever.
Say, how are you going to sell all those fish before they spoil?
She finally decided to return it to her father. Bless her heart.
She wouldn't have to be there at all, if it weren't for Roggvir.
Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.
Since you're still alive, I assume you have good news to report?
Sir, they're on the move. They'll be at the gates at any moment!
Skuli owns the inn with his mother gone, but I handle the rooms.
So, did Delvin send you again or you here on your own this time?
So, what's your heart's desire? What kind of deal can we strike?
Some days I marvel that you haven't managed to blow yourself up.
Some say murdered, but it was a lawful challenge in the old way.
Something strange happens to Khajiit when they arrive in Skyrim.
Sorry about the mess. Keeping this place clean is quite a chore.
Sorry, I have everyone I need at the warehouse. Times are tight.
Stonehills' warmth is a welcome change in this cold, bleak land.
Tell me about the Great War. I hear you were in the battle of...
Thanks for the offer, Jouane, but I'm saving up for a new sword.
That was suspiciously nice of her. I thought she hated everyone.
That we have forgotten them, this I fear the gods will remember.
That's good news. I was starting to fear something had happened.
The General's put me in charge of assisting the new governments.
The gods smile on them who show charity. Best you remember that.
The guards don't even dare go up there unless they've no choice.
The mine gives us purpose. Something many of us have wished for.
The sisters are communing with Dibella. They can't be disturbed.
The strong and honorable always carry the blessing of the Eight.
Then come for me, [QUOTE]daughter of Skyrim.[QUOTE] Come for me!
Then this is beyond coincidence. First Aringoth and now Sabjorn.
Then you should know that Louis and I have a certain... history.
There are opportunities everywhere.  Why don't you go find them.
There is one possibility. But... no, the Jarl would never agree.
There's a reason the city guard doesn't come down here you know.
Things have been a lot worse around here since Ulfric took over.
This next song goes out to the Dragonborn. The savior of Skyrim.
This woman has endured, has challenged, and has shown her valor.
Three guards run into a bar, but the fourth one just ducks. Why?
Try and be careful, all right? We don't want to damage anything.
Ugh. I'll need to bathe thoroughly to get this stench off of me.
Unscrupulous daring. It's why you fell in love with me, my dear.
Until that dragon's dealt with, I don't care what Tullius wants.
Very good. I hope this will allow us to maintain our reputation.
Very well, then. If that's the way you want to play it, we will.
Wait... you mean I should just... tell her? Tell her how I feel?
Wandered around as a blade for hire. Was a damned good one, too.
Watch your tongue, stranger. We don't take backtalk in this inn.
We have the utmost confidence in you and Ulfric's guiding hands.
We must be near the entrance for that bear to make its den here.
We must hold. We can't allow the Skull to fall into their hands.
We need to get moving! That dragon is tearing up the whole keep!
We want Hjaalmarch back, and Idgrod Ravencrone restored as Jarl.
We will avenge Kodlak. And they will know terror before the end.
We will do your next test in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.
We're one of the same kind, you and I. I'm glad to have met you.
Welcome to Riften, traveler. I hope the road fared well for you.
Well done! I don't know where I'd be without you, my old friend.
Well now! That's a shamefully absurd way to go around in public.
Well why don't you be quick about finding my book that you lost?
Well, as a jailbreaker, you work alone. No Guild to back you up.
Well, everyone's wrong. Now why don't you just shut up about it.
Well, that and maybe those stuck-up, dung-sniffing Battle-Borns.
Well, the Priesthood of Arkay always accepts generous donations.
What are you playing at? Is this some attempt to stall my work?!
What if Arvel doesn't come back? I want my share from that claw!
What if I told you about a large shipment of silver and weapons?
What? Oh, nothing. It's just... It's an interesting development.
When I tell you to, try and hit all four targets in ten seconds.
Wizard tricks! An Orc faces the enemy. He doesn't hide from him.
Woah, woah. Calm down. Let's just think about this for a moment.
Wonderful. And let's not have this chat again next week. Agreed?
Work hard for the future and leave the past be. That's my motto.
Yes, I know what you mean. Most Nords struggle to accept change.
Yes, she's been grooming herself for this for quite a long time.
Yes, this probably isn't really the place for your little jokes.
Yes, you're innocent. As innocent as anyone can be in this city.
Yes, you're right. I should have, but I didn't know what to say.
You always brighten my day a little. Here. I hope you like this.
You better get that armor on. Give that sword a few swings, too.
You can bring weapons in, but you can't use 'em in here. Got it?
You come right to me if you find an unwashed floor or lumpy bed.
You dare strut around here, wearing that filthy Stormcloak hide?
You do not answer... Must I use this guttural language of yours?
You go ahead and arrange the wedding ceremony when you're ready.
You have made your choice, Dragonborn. You are not welcome here.
You just let old nana know if you need anything, all right dear?
You miss them? I don't know how many times I feared for my life.
You poor thing. You should come by the temple, speak to Maramal.
You should know. You got the map for me from Bleak Falls Barrow.
You should talk to Ainethach. He runs the mines. Used to anyway.
You still need to remove that blood stain. From the... incident.
You there, uh, the finest silver in Markarth is sold right here.
You think I'd abandon an opportunity to lead my Family to glory?
You think living with Grogmar is easy? Did you see how he lives?
You want to try again? Fine, but I'll be watching you carefully.
You! You'll help me! You help people, right? That's what you do?
You'd think an apprentice could forge a few hinges. Not Tacitus.
You're a bad sneak. You're not creeping up on anybody like that.
You're like me, eh? Don't fancy those clunky two-handed weapons.
You've come. The draugr infesting Namira's sanctuary are inside.
You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. Splendid, splendid...
You've got to tell them! We weren't with you! This is a mistake!
Young warriors are smart to listen to older ones. They've lived.
...must oil Mother soon... ...get all the hard to reach places...
Ah, look at the pretty, shiny coins. Now, how best to spend them?
Ah, my son, you'll be a fine innkeeper someday, like your father.
Ah, that. Yes, the group prior to yours has disappeared entirely.
Ah, well, if Hadvar vouches for you I guess it must be all right.
Aha! Here we are. Honored guests, I present to you - the Gourmet!
All right, hand over your valuables, or I'll gut you like a fish.
All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you. Good luck!
All that effort, and you just kill her. You've ruined everything.
Amazing what people leave laying around for us to take, isn't it?
And here I thought you were a master criminal. Guess I was wrong.
And telling her what? That you stole her horse? I don't think so.
Anything to break the boredom of living in this town. I envy you.
Are you attempting to threaten me? After I've been so hospitable?
Are you finished your other business and ready to face the Guild?
Are you going to walk over to father and start hitting him again?
Are you prepared, then, to help bring the light across this land?
Aren't they slow? I can get in and out before you have one swing.
As long as we keep Talos in our heart, his legacy will never die.
As you wish. This moment, we three, will be immortalized in song.
Assorted books, scrolls... I'm sure you'll find something useful.
Assur had to move away because of the Empire. But we get to stay.
Ay, it is.  I suppose it won't hurt the girl to eat it this once.
Bandits are cowards. Don't strain yourself chasing them all down.
Be careful around here. You don't want to anger the wrong person.
Be on your guard. I've no idea what to expect inside the College.
Because that's what traitorous cowards do when they desire power.
Begging your pardon my lady, but I strongly recommend against it.
Being a Jarl could hardly be simpler. You should try it sometime.
Beware of the serpent in your midst! Beware, oh people of Skyrim!
But I can promise the next time we meet, it will be your undoing.
But I'm sure you didn't come here for a lecture on high politics.
Calcelmo is stubborn as a mule. Be careful when you speak to him.
Call it what you want. You don't pay, then you're not getting in.
Captain Aldis can't prove it, but that Argonian is up to no good.
Careful with those flames, unless you plan on torching something.
Cheers, my friend! May your adventures find you fame and fortune!
Come on, come on. The sooner you buy, the sooner I can get drunk.
Come on, I can take anyone. And that ain't just the mead talkin'.
Come, Dovahkiin. Nin Yol. Strike me with the fire of your Thu'um.
Cut me loose, minion of the Hated One. I need to get to Markarth.
Did you see that serving girl? I hear elf women are insatiable...
Didn't you hear the thundering sound as you returned to Whiterun?
Don't forget to speak to Jorn when you're ready for the festival.
Don't go casting spells on a woman without asking her permission.
Don't let the men take advantage of you, always be on your guard.
Don't reckon they can use you. But stranger things have happened.
Don't rush your shot. Crouch down, get comfortable, and take aim.
Don't you dare walk away from me, you slut! Do you know who I am?
Don't you worry about her. I've sent my best men to round her up.
Don't you worry about him. I've sent my best men to round him up.
Draugr are slow and clumsy. Hardly a challenge for a man like me.
Ever see someone killed with their own weapon? Would you like to?
Exactly! Now you're beginning to see how our little system works.
Favor a steel sword, do ya? Good choice for slashing or stabbing.
Get the crown. We will keep an eye out for more of those dustmen.
Go then. Fulfill your destiny. Take the Scroll to the Time-Wound.
Good to see you. At least you know how to treat someone properly.
Good. I'll have a sack of coin waiting for you when you get back.
Good. That's what I want to hear. Now go make it happen, soldier.
Got one all saddled and ready to go. What are you willing to pay?
Hard to believe people actually have to work in places like this.
Have you learned nothing about me? I have dealings with everyone.
Have you managed to track down the Synod, or the Staff of Magnus?
Have you spoken to my parents yet? Please, my love depends on it!
Here for work? Get an axe and bring me all the wood you can chop.
Here, take these as well, they may prove useful for your journey.
Hey, hey. Sorry. I just get jealous when I hear rumors about you.
Hey, if you're in good with Maven you've pretty much got it made.
Hey, Orc. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, you. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, you're not supposed to be down here. Official business only.
How interesting. It appears Gallus's history has repeated itself.
Hroggar's house fire? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
I admit, I've never felt entirely at ease in the Thalmor embassy.
I almost envy you. That first time is always the most... intense.
I am beyond your pathetic attempts at magic. You cannot touch me.
I am Burguk's favored wife. He knows my beauty should be praised.
I asked her the same thing and she wouldn't come out and tell me.
I brought him the coin and walked away with her copy of the deed.
I can take a hint, lad. You want to make some coin, come find me.
I can't believe he emptied the vault. Right from under our noses.
I don't have time to chase shadows, I've got better things to do.
I don't know what we do with it now. Maybe you can figure it out.
I don't know what we're doing here. Ulfric must have his reasons.
I don't like doing business with Azura's faithful. Make it quick.
I don't like talking to someone who holds their honor so cheaply.
I don't miss home one bit. I'm glad to leave that life behind me.
I don't need you to teach me how to play high politics in Skyrim.
I don't see these troubles as business. This is a labor of honor.
I don't think Ulfric knew how much Torygg respected him for that.
I don't want any trouble. Not after what you did to me last time.
I had heard that Gjukar's men were wiped out. I came to find you.
I have potions for disease, love sickness, irritating children...
I have something amazing to show you that demands your attention!
I hear people were spotted using the Black Door. Gods have mercy.
I held in my rage as long as I could. But it boiled inside of me.
I hope I'm wrong. I'm not sure the Empire can afford another war.
I hope so. Skyrim needs people like you to fight for her freedom.
I hope we don't run into anything worse than Stormcloaks in here.
I just want to find a good husband, and start a family of my own.
I must return to the court. They simply can't make do without me.
I need to get back to Solitude and let them know what's happened.
I owe Thorald my life. Helping to save him is the least I can do.
I remember old Arnleif building each shelf in this store himself.
I speak, and others hear. It is my hope that instead they listen.
I suggest you listen to what Mercer has to say... if you want in.
I suppose you'd better hope you can, if you want the information.
I suppose you're used to traveling, being a stranger around here.
I think it's sweet Lu'ah is so worked up over her dead soldier...
I think you play beautifully. It would be a shame if you stopped.
I thought you could help us out. Food, supplies, a place to stay.
I will see that it is dealt with. Thank you for bringing clarity.
I wish I could be an adventurer like you, and go wherever I want.
I wish she would. At least that way she'd have people to talk to.
I work at the mill. Chop trees, carry logs, saw lumber, you know.
I work in the mines. I hunt. Everything else I do is my business.
I would suggest staying on the plates with the Dragonborn symbol.
I... I've been trying to find the time and place to let her know.
I'd hoped we could work something out, that you would see reason.
I'd take it to Calixto. He's got a good eye for pieces like that.
I'll follow you till I'm dust in the breeze. You do realize that?
I'll just be on my way then. Please do be careful, and thank you.
I'll see to it that Sorli is safe now that she's running Morthal.
I'm afraid we have little to offer you in the way of hospitality.
I'm certain you're aware of the loss I sustained a fortnight ago.
I'm feeling better, but Bashnag's curse won't wear off for weeks.
I'm going to be a silversmith one day, like my mother and father.
I'm not here to hold your hand. Figure this one out for yourself.
I'm so sorry. I hope the Eight give you more peace in the future.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Cyrodiil.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Orsinium.
I've got coin and I've got merchandise. Let's see what we can do.
I've had just about all I'm willing to take from you. What is it?
I've never seen Pavo so happy. It's good to be back in Kolskeggr.
I've spoken to Brynjolf and he assures me it'll be taken care of.
If I wanted to get yelled at, I'd be home. Can't you leave me be?
If it's the war you're referring to, I'm on the side of Whiterun.
If the world is meant to end, so be it. Let it end and be reborn.
If you are not here to grant me a good death, then you can leave.
If you need an apothecary, the White Phial has respectable stock.
If you need any help with Destruction spells, please let me know.
If you're planning violence against me or mine, you'll regret it.
If you've got the gold to pay my fee, then my sword-arm is yours.
Illusion really is the least appreciated of the schools of magic.
In a sense, but no more poisoned than a fool after too much wine.
Indeed. And so you have come looking, though you do not know why.
Is it time yet? Time for me to make my sword? Or maybe... an axe?
It was Dengeir who made me a steward, long ago when he was young.
It's a reflection of all possible futures and all possible pasts.
It's a simple ceremony, but it'll do. You're here. That's enough.
It's amazing how much work goes into the little things, isn't it?
It's been... years I think, but perhaps you could still find him.
It's okay, I know what happened at home. With the dragon and all.
It's the only thing I've even heard of that could cut Eldergleam.
Just get out of town as fast as you can. Nothing for anyone here.
Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death.
Let me guess - you have some [QUOTE]business[QUOTE] to discuss...
Let's listen to Enthir's translation before we decide what we do.
Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau.
Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room.
Locked him up someplace to get back at my family. I'm sure of it.
Look around you. The Flagon, the Guild... it's all fallin' apart.
Look here! You see how the ancient Blades revered Reman Cyrodiil.
Look. One of the ancient Nord ruins. Who knows what's down there?
Lots of lawless folk around here. Foreigners, mostly. No offense.
Luck? I think it has more to do with the hard work and good soil.
Make up your mind, will you? You're starting to make us look bad.
Maven wants to see you right away. I suggest you head right over.
May knowledge of your Divinity carry us through our daily trials.
Mining iron takes a lot of strength and special reinforced tools.
Must it be written? Poetry is so dull when it isn't set to music.
My father Kleppr is the one you want to talk to. I just clean up.
My joy knows no bounds. Here. A little payment for your troubles.
My mother and father died years ago. Falion takes care of me now.
Namira spoke to you? I knew this feast was going to be something.
Need a poison for your hunting? My mother, Murbul, knows several.
Need something for a potion? You're certainly in the right place.
Needless to say, these rebels and I have no love for each other. 
Never seen the guy so angry. Better help him out any way you can.
No need to bother with giants right now. Just keep your distance.
No problem, but if you get too far away, we're going to catch up.
No. You can use the North Gate, or you can head to the next city.
Nords' armor has lots of fur. This sometimes makes M'aiq nervous.
Not bad, not bad. The intensity of the hunt is special, isn't it?
Not everyone, but all the Circle are. It's a secret to everybody.
Nothing solid. Yet. But my gut tells me it can't be anybody else.
Now we'll see if there's anything behind your talk of good faith.
Of course. Something that seems to be in short supply these days.
Oh alright.  Well I'll be here for a bit if you change your mind.
Oh my. Been a lot of years since I've seen something like that...
Oh, good. I've been waiting for you. Here you go, it's all ready.
Oh, great, another wanderer. Slumming it on your way to Windhelm?
Oh, I think you dropped this. Some kind of note. Looks important.
Oh, I'm not sure I could ever settle down like you have, friend. 
Oh, very well. Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done.
Oh. Well, you should probably go get it before someone steals it.
Oh... well... I can see you have no appreciation for scholarship.
On the other hand, he also refuses to acknowledge Ulfric's claim.
Only a few things came today. Cedran said he'd drop it off later.
Or at least, I thought I was. I don't really know what I'm doing.
Please. Not now. You'll know when I'm ready to discuss the issue.
Poor Banning. Twice as much work here in the stables without him.
Really? You're who she picked? I hope she knows what she's doing.
Riften, eh? Probably down in the Ratway, then. It's where I'd go.
Right. And what did you say the point of this little venture was?
Roggi tell you about the scorcher we found under the scaffolding?
Secondly, we plan on liberating a settlement from Imperial hands.
Seems to me like it just ended... it's never really ended for me.
Set an ambush along the road between, or camp by one of the inns.
She was a stubborn Dunmer... always had to do everything her way.
Sir, these are missing commands for about half of the commanders.
Slink away now, little Khajiit, with your tail between your legs.
So far, things are going well. Let's just hope the weather holds.
So much for old soldiers settling down to a life of luxury, eh?  
So, now that you're Guild Master, how about drinks for all of us!
Someday, a gallant hero will ride up and take me away. Someday...
Someone should let that cat lose.  That'd shut him up real quick.
Something about placing it back in Yngol's chamber, I don't know.
Sometimes the difference between life an' death is a swift steed.
Sorry. We got nothin' to talk about. Vex will straighten you out.
Stop what? Taking Skyrim back from those who'd leave her to rot? 
Thanks again for the delivery to Markarth. What can I do for you?
Thanks! I thought I was going to rot in here. So what's the plan?
That armor on Gunjar isn't doing him any good. Go ahead. Take it.
That's good armor you've got there, friend. Iron, solid and true.
The Empire didn't think we could take the Reach, but here we are.
The fool's my husband. I'm Fjola - or I was, once. Don't you see?
The Forsworn have taken Kolskeggr Mine. We're the only ones left.
The Gray Quarter's a disgrace. Them dark elves live like animals.
The Greybeards tend not to get out much, if you catch my meaning.
The Justiciars know your face. And we elves have long memories...
The one who stole it has fled to what he thinks is his sanctuary.
The only way to bring it back will be through the Pilgrim's Path.
The Psijic Order? Are you quite sure about that? That's very odd.
The soldiers? From which side, the Stormcloaks, or the Imperials?
The sort of embellishment wizards of ancient times loved to make.
The Thanes have every confidence in General Tullius's leadership.
The Windpeak Inn features the finest bard in all of Dawnstar. Me.
The witches didn't lie, of course. But it's more than our bodies.
Then find one. That dung heap Grisvar's been known to make a few.
Then it is done at last. Perhaps it was all worth it, in the end.
There are no goods to bring to the store. That's what I'm saying.
There may be a matter in which your... skills... could be useful.
There were also two items requiring disciplinary action recently.
There's just one more target before we strike out at the Emperor.
There's one way to find out. Try to Shout... that would prove it.
These people are like cattle. All they do is work, sleep and eat.
These terms blatantly favor the rebels. Everyone here knows that.
They threw me in here because I called Ulfric a liar; a deceiver.
This castle is old. Lots of places nobody's been in a long while.
This is it for you. Any last words before I send you to Oblivion?
This one would try a shop. You might prefer the direct route, hm?
This place is boring. Nothing but the same thing every day. Sigh.
Tough day at the mines. I swear the ore is getting harder to dig.
Ulfric showed up at the gates of Solitude requesting an audience.
Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion.
Unfortunately for you, we don't allow men into the inner sanctum.
Unmid, I wish to travel about the city. Prepare an escort please.
Very well, but when their emissary arrives I want words with him.
Very well. He seems like a fighter to me. I'll give him the oath.
Walkin' never hurt nobody. If you change your mind, I'll be here.
Wasn't long before I saw more of the world than I bargained for. 
Watch yourself, these Nordic ruins are notorious for their traps.
We can't go back. Might as well go forward. We can still do this.
We can't thank you enough for helping us get this office running.
We were just talking about you. My brother needs a word with you.
We'll be back at the College before anyone even knows we're gone.
We're marching on Movarth's Lair whether you come with us or not.
Well come back when you earn some more so I can take it from you!
Well then, let's get started. I've got three available right now.
Well uh, Endon is a silversmith in Markarth, so I just assumed...
Well, at least allow me to reward you for your uncanny foresight.
What are you doing here, outlander? We don't deal with your kind.
What are you doing? You're supposed to be attending the ceremony.
What is it with you and all these questions? Very well, ask away.
What... What was that? Everything seemed to shimmer for a moment.
What's it matter to you? Not like you could do anything about it.
Whatever the case may be, her intentions are far from benevolent.
When I'm done here, I'd be more than happy to sell you an elixir.
Why are you following me? I told you, I don't know anything else!
Why don't they listen to me, Keerava? Why won't they do as I say?
Winterhold might yet thrive if that College had never been built.
With a master of magic at your side, you'll have nothing to fear.
Woman, there's a vein of malachite as thick as my leg back there.
Wuunferth? Bah. It's purely ceremonial, and he has no use for it.
You better have a damn good reason to be here with that murderer.
You can't go to a party at the Thalmor Embassy dressed like that.
You going to try and sell me something? Well, I ain't interested.
You have shown that you are Dragonborn. You have the inborn gift.
You hear that? I swear, there's something out there. In the dark.
You here to see Rulindil, too, eh? None of my business of course.
You know what needs to be done. Is there something more you need?
You learn a new word like a master... you truly do have the gift.
You look suspicious. You better not be one of those damn thieves.
You made it! I'm impressed. It was a gamble, but turned out well.
You must be a Stormcloak through and through to request that one.
You must be one of those wizards. From the College in Winterhold.
You want me to close my eyes? Would that even things up a little?
You want Thonar Silver-Blood. He handles all the family business.
You would care about that, since you're the Arch-Mage's favorite!
You, mage, and you alone, have the potential to prevent disaster.
You'll want some thick armor if you're traveling the Reach alone.
You're making a fatal mistake. Apologize, and you may yet live...
Your path has brought you to the finest fletcher in all the land.
Your sigil stone. Lord Dagon is... less than pleased at its loss.
[QUOTE]your cunning capture of Numinex, a con for the ages.[QUOTE]
A fine day to you, friend. May you die with a sword in your hands.
A mindless vendetta urged on you by a cabal of Akaviri barbarians!
Aela will be joining us shortly. Once she's inside, we can follow.
Ah, fire. A capricious element. Often deadly, but always exciting.
Ah, hello my Nord friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?
Ah! I've heard of this Shouting, but never seen it. Fascinating...
All right, Brand-Shei. Turn out your pockets, we know you have it.
All that remains is to ensure the safe return of the Skeleton Key.
All that remains of the infamous cult, I've gathered in my museum.
Alright, alright... Um... How about [QUOTE]The Guttersnipe[QUOTE]?
Although I suppose a little mead now and then would be harmless...
An array so great, in fact, that it remains a source of curiosity.
And yet they want to heap the fault on my family's good name? Bah.
Another refugee? Gods really have abandoned your people, dark elf.
Are you excited? Oh, you should be. Things are finally looking up!
Are you prepared to join your spirit with the beast world, friend?
Are you ready to enter the Star and purge the soul of Malyn Varen?
As for myself, I've always been content to simply be an alchemist.
Back to the swamp with you, Argonian. Lest I carve you into boots.
Bolund, you're going to die of thirst if you keep calling me that.
Brave man, with the Blackbloods out there. Did you catch anything?
Break our men out and head to the courtyard. We'll meet you there.
But I know about him. And about the war. More than he might think.
But if they've captured you.... Oh gods, where are they taking us?
But look... if you need work, Hod can always use help at the mill.
But war is war. Right? Nobody could blame me for that. Could they?
By Ysmir, this is horrible! I never wanted the girl dead, I swear!
Can't prove it. But I could use your help, being unbiased and all.
Captain, I've been receiving complaints about this Giordano woman.
Come on, Heimvar. My son could stoke the forge better than you do!
Come to think of it, I know of a win-win situation for both of us.
Damn ears... playing tricks on me again. Can't stand this sea air!
Did you bring a torch? These old forts can get pretty dark inside.
Do you remember the Legion? Fighting the Thalmor in the Great War?
Do you think that ghost is coming back? It seems to have vanished.
Don't forget your represntin' the Guild. Don't do anythin' stupid.
Don't mind the yelling. My parents are always going at each other.
Don't start swinging that thing in here. You break it, you buy it.
Don't worry, I'll treat those shipments as if I owned them myself.
Don't you even know what's going on? A dragon is attacking Helgen!
Easy there. I don't want that kind of trouble. Guy ain't worth it.
Eh. I try not to trouble myself with stories of the outside world.
Enough already. Put on some clothes. You're making people nervous.
Every prisoner in the Reach is just another worker for our family.
Father oughtta punch them in the mouth! That'd get people in here!
Few enough reasons to pass through Morthal before the war started.
Few will admit it, but we know the truth about the Great Collapse.
Fine, I won't fire him, but I'm doing this for your sake. Not his.
Finely done. Here, please accept this gift as a sign of my thanks.
For shame! You should be locked up for strutting around like that.
From the moment I arrived here, I've felt myself... well... dying.
Gallus's Oath has been paid. His actions have satisfied the terms.
Good to have a customer! You need food or drink, you say the word.
Good. Concentration is paramount when dealing with magical forces.
Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.
Guard might get nervous, a man approaches with his weapon drawn...
Gulum-Ei is our inside man at the East Empire Company in Solitude.
Ha! Tough talk for someone who's about to have their guts spilled.
Ha. Good luck to you, friend. She's not one who likes to be found.
Hardly worth giving up Markarth for, but not a bad starting point.
He just couldn't accept that. And now he'll have to pay the price.
He knew what he was getting into. I don't... I don't blame anyone.
Hello and welcome, my friend. How may I help you on this fine day?
Here, take this as a bit of a reward for nabbing our little thief.
How are the headaches, dear? You or your mother still having them?
I also hope that this is the last time we'll need to discuss this.
I bet my papa could have beat you up. He was stronger than anyone.
I can take a hint, lass. You want to make some coin, come find me.
I could run the Skeever! You even said I'm almost as smart as you!
I couldn't. It would dishonor the place the chief has made for me.
I couldn't. It would shame my chief and my mother and foremothers.
I do love my wife. Just wish she'd get her head out of the clouds.
I don't have time for your foolishness. Either help me or be gone.
I don't know who you think I am, and I don't care. Leave me alone!
I don't know. It's like a ward, but who's casting it? Ancano? How?
I feel the eyes of angry spirits upon us. We are not welcome here.
I felt the same way when Gallus first revealed these things to me.
I found the bone! I've brought it to you but still I am refused...
I guess it's all over. I expected... I don't know what I expected.
I have a single one left, quite expensive, but also quite elegant.
I have to work twice as hard because you drink up all our profits.
I hope you'll stay for a bit. We could certainly use the business.
I knew you couldn't stay away. Admit it, you were lost without me.
I know I did. But how was I to know the shipment would get robbed?
I know you can't hear me, brother. I don't like what we've become.
I really appreciate what you've done for me. I'll never forget it.
I said a hundred gold! Damn broke elves and damn broke elf-lovers.
I saw you. With the Forsworn. By the old gods, that was something.
I studied with them when I was young. They taught me how to Shout.
I suppose I would, but you're the only one who gets that greeting.
I suppose you think you're better than me because you can do that?
I swear upon Lady Mara that I would never let any harm befall you.
I think I saw it again. That... ghost. It was over by the barrows.
I think you've had plenty, Vulwulf. Maybe you should head on home.
I understand what's best for Solitude... and Jarl Elisif knows it.
I was born and raised in Skyrim, but the Nords treat us like dirt.
I wish to cleanse myself that I might know glory in the afterlife.
I wish you luck, but should leave here while I still have my skin.
I wonder if there's any more Imperials hiding down here somewhere.
I would stand at her back, that the world might never overtake us.
I would stand at his back, that the world might never overtake us.
I'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation.
I'll send word to the strongholds to let you in as one of our own.
I'm Burguk's forge-wife. I shape all the steel for the stronghold.
I'm fairly certain you wandered into the wrong building, friend...
I'm going to Movarth's Lair to kill that monster. Are you with me?
I'm in no position to go searching for her, but perhaps you could.
I'm not going to warn you again. Get out, or I'll call the guards!
I'm not sure if half these potions work. But they should. I think.
I'm not very good for anything more than smithing nails right now.
I'm sorry, but you don't seem to have enough gold to pay for that.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to High Rock.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Morrowind.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Valenwood.
I've always fancied a journey up the 7,000 Steps to the monastery.
I've never been inside a dwarven ruin. They are simply astounding.
I've seen my share of black magic, but that's all in the past now.
If he does, tell him how bad the food is. And how dangerous it is.
If I only knew where he was, I'd sure give him a piece of my mind.
If it's armor you need, we've got all kinds, both light and heavy.
If the Guild isn't willing to listen to reason, you might have to.
If you're looking for a challenge, you've come to the right place.
In fact, the night she disappeared, she was supposed to meet Alva.
In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize her claim.
In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize his claim.
Inside is the heart. The heart of a god! The heart of you. And me.
Interesting, to say the least. What with all that's been going on.
Is that so? Well, I'll make sure that's taken care of immediately.
It is not eyes that reveal another's true nature. It is the heart.
It's fine. Much better than the rickety tools I had in the Legion.
It's too late. There isn't enough of him left to go back in after.
Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again.
Jarl Vignar, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?
Just a pilgrim. I'd prefer to leave it at that, if you don't mind.
Just look at this place. Is this what passes for a fort in Skyrim?
Just take a step back and let me figure this out. Then we'll talk.
Just take my advice and just get out of Riften as soon as you can.
Just watch your back and do what Mercer says... he'll sort it out.
Keep your distance and you shouldn't have anything to worry about.
Keep your weapon out of your hands, and we'll get along just fine.
Khajiit wishes for you to go away. You have done us too much harm.
Lady Mara's messenger returns. What can I help you with, my child?
Let's take our time. I think we can sneak by her if we're careful.
Listen, as far as I'm concerned you've already earned your pardon.
M'aiq once walked to High Hrothgar. So many steps, he lost count. 
Mages need to be reminded to be careful around research materials.
Magic is for the weak. Pick up some steel if you want to fight me.
Make your choice, Dragonborn. You're either with us or against us.
Making that trip to Darkwater Crossing was a huge help. Thank you.
Mara only helps those who can afford her tithes. This is nonsense.
Maven be damned. One day, she'll get hers. I can promise you that.
Mining accident, back when I was in prison for being a pickpocket.
Mining out this old rock is a lot quieter, now. Thank the Divines.
My hatred for the Empire is bested only by love for my countrymen.
My mother taught me. She was a Bard, from the college in Solitude.
My son? Erik? What about him? Did something happen? Is he alright?
My talents are much needed here, in order to keep Morthal... safe.
Name is Stig Salt-Plank, one of the captains of the Blood Horkers.
Need something? Unlike the rest of my family, I've got work to do.
Next time, you might want to get dressed before leaving the house.
Nid. If you wish me to answer your question, you must answer mine.
No, we can only rely on ourselves. You'd do well to remember that.
No? You sure? 'Cause we're reaching the point of no return here...
Not every Nord is obsessed with strength, honor and skill at arms.
Not quite worth handing over Riften, but not a bad starting point.
Now if someone brings me a dragon scale, that's a different story.
Now remove yourself from my presence, while you still draw breath.
Now that everyone is here, please take your seats so we can begin.
Now you, lass... You've got some beautiful trunks yourself... Hmm?
Now... I don't really want to talk about it anymore. So let's not.
Now... I trust we'll never have to speak of this again. To anyone.
Oh my... umm, you won't let Mercer hear about this will you? Ahem.
Oh you're back. Do you still think you could stand as a Companion?
Oh, and here. You're a Stormcloak now, you ought to look the part.
Oh, it's not so terrible. I actually find the work quite relaxing.
Oh, no. I won't tell you anything more until we have an agreement.
Oh, really? So that Dark Elf took my ring. So typical of his kind.
Oh, they'll find some way to send us there. It'll be just my luck.
Oh, we'll make sure it's emptied out by morning. You can trust us!
Oh, wonderful. You don't know how happy I am to hear you say that.
Oh, yes, please, old man. Regale us with your tales of wizardry...
Old man, without me, you would have withered away a long time ago.
Our best hope now is to fall in with the ranks of the Stormcloaks.
Papa says I'm too friendly with strangers, but you seem all right.
Reliable and headstrong? You're turning out to be quite the prize!
Runil has been a true friend to my wife and I in our time of need.
Save your anger for the forge. The steel cannot hear your whining.
She's got friends in high places, and I don't just mean in Skyrim.
Shhh. Listen to Enthir... we can't afford to miss a single detail.
Sissel thinks she's so special. No way she's more special than me.
Snilf, it's me. I don't have a roof over my head either, remember?
So what - Ulfric gets this crown and then suddenly he's High King?
So you think that Alduin's Wall will tell us how to defeat Alduin?
So, does it show how they defeated him? Isn't that why we're here?
So, name your poison! Ha ha ha. Oh, I never get tired of that one!
So, what's the latest exciting news about goings-on in Winterhold?
So, word has it you and Brynjolf know where Mercer's hiding. Good.
So, you're Brynjolf's new protege, eh? Don't look like much to me.
Sorry Mercer, they no longer wish to be involved in our operation.
Still can't wake him up? Perhaps you're barking up the wrong tree?
Still eager to please. This is good. Skjor may be right about you.
Straighten yourself out with the Guild and then maybe we can talk.
Styrr says she's still in spirit form or we'd all be dead already.
Sulla, let's just get out of here. Hasn't there been enough death?
Thalmor in the Ratway? What's next, Spriggans in the Bee and Barb?
Thank you again. I can't believe I was this close to being killed.
Thank you, friend. Don't worry. I'll have that shiv ready for you.
That old place? I could care less about it. Its you I want, Bolli.
That weapon breaks my wares, we're gonna have us a real problem...
That's done it! Alright, boys, let's get moving. We've got more...
That's enough of this unnecessary chatting, we need to keep going.
The Divines reveal things to me at times, yes. I do not hide this.
The Imperials wouldn't have just let you walk away. Remember that.
The lady's already paid the fee. We leave when she gives the word.
The only thing Vald understands is gold. A man after my own heart.
The temple is the one place my wife finds peace these days, Runil.
The trees... they're beautiful here. Reminds me of autumn at home.
Their souls are trapped in Oblivion all the same, and here I stay.
Then get out of my way. I have to get to a town and find a priest.
Then just confront Haelga with them and the rest works itself out.
There are more books to be recovered and secured in the Arcanaeum.
There's a pack of werewolf hunters camped nearby, at Gallows Rock.
There's something... personal... I was hoping you would do for me.
They don't call me the Ember-Master for nothing. What do you need?
They're not my aunts. They're your aunts. And they told me enough.
This had better be the last I hear of you disrespecting my family.
This is gettin' dangerous. Don't let anythin' get the jump on you.
This is what happens to you when you speak your mind in this city.
Those who are ignorant find the Way of the Voice easy to ridicule.
Trust your instincts, Dovahkiin. Your blood will show you the way.
Try not to walk into any spike-filled pits or filthy skeever dens.
Trying to make Mercer look bad in front of Maven, eh? Clever lass.
Very well. I'll give you a chance. But if you can't do it, I will.
Very well. She seems like a fighter to me. I'll give her the oath.
Wait. You win. I'll ease off on the beatings, just leave me alone.
Watch yourself out there or they'll take everything away from you.
We all get used, dear. It's living with it that makes you a woman.
We bring you here to make you stronger, new blood. Now let's move.
We chop trees, we mill the wood. What more would you want to know?
We have nothing to talk about. I can't believe what you did to me.
We're a small village, but we work hard, and take care of our own.
We're getting close now. Be careful. Their leader is a tricky one.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Ice Wolf pelts.
Welcome, welcome! We were just beginning. Please, stay and listen.
Well you can either get better with a bow or try to learn from me.
Well, I grow old. My mind turns towards the horizon. To Sovngarde.
Well, yes. But the Key isn't only restricted to physical barriers.
Well, you'd better go pick it up then, before someone snatches it.
What about you? Are you ready to transact the Oath with Nocturnal?
What brings you to me? Find some strange creature in your travels?
What have you done? You weren't supposed to murder anyone! Gods...
What will Skyrim have become if her children submitted to tyranny?
What'cha doing in Left Hand? Do you dig up rocks too, like my mom?
What's happened? Did you find a way to learn the Dragonrend Shout?
What's this? It thinks it can just throw refuse wherever it likes?
Who is he speaking with? What are they planning? I fear treachery.
Whoa. Wait a second. I was just kidding. We'll leave. We'll leave!
Why would they be looking at me? Are they upset about the service?
Windhelm is absolutely freezing. How can these people tolerate it?
Without us looking out for Winterhold, it's doomed. Simply doomed.
You and everyone else. Word is it may not happen this year though.
You are an Orc, but do not know of Malacath, our master and yours?
You can try, but I'd keep your sword-arm ready if things get ugly.
You give me one more look, and I cut you open. That Skooma's mine.
You have to let me out. They're going to do something awful to me!
You here for lessons like Ingun? Or did you wish to buy something?
You know how farming is here, long days and little to show for it.
You know, I ought to retire and leave you to run the Skeever, son!
You know, since Kodlak's funeral the Skyforge feels more... awake.
You left this back there. Figured you'd be wantin' it. Here ya go.
You look a little sturdier than most of the Popinjays around here.
You must first prove your worth, and then I shall lead you across.
You need to be easier on Asgeir. All he wants to do is please you.
You seem like such a nice person. I'd love to hear more about you.
You should be aware that many apply but we accept very few people.
You should probably put that away before you knock something over.
You stand right there and count to 10. No peaking. Ready? Okay go!
You trying to scare off my customers, son? Lively! Keep it lively!
You want me to hunt with you? I thought you preferred being alone.
You will be called upon to rely solely on your Restoration spells.
You'll be back. If you're really Dragonborn, this is your destiny.
You're a little light on coin there, my friend. No gold, no refit.
You're welcome in Riften as long as you continue to obey our laws.
[QUOTE]When the Snow Tower lies sundered, kingless, bleeding[QUOTE]
A stretch in the Castle Dour Dungeon will straighten you right out.
Ah, a snitch, eh? Can't have you running to any guards now, can I? 
Ah! A fellow Nord! I trust you're bringing the fight to the Empire.
All hail the savior of the Dark Brotherhood! All Hail the Listener!
All my goods are legitimate, which is more than I can say for some.
All right, pipe down. You want the whole blessed place to hear you?
Although our Jarl's humble wizard might be willing to help you too.
An assault. On my watch. By the gods, he'll not get away with this.
And by [QUOTE]supplies[QUOTE] I suppose you mean weapons and armor.
And don't worry about any rioting, Legate. I have it under control.
And if I were you I'd hurry. I've never seen him this angry before.
And keeps herself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...
And keeps himself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...
And now, thanks to you, the city is back under the Empire's banner.
And speaking of spoiling Dorthe, who made her a new doll last week?
And with no strings attached. Not bad. Here, got some coin for you.
Anton sure looks like he's from the Reach, but don't tell him that.
Anything I can pick up for you on my next trip into the city, Erik?
Are you ready for me to show Azura her Star and receive her wisdom?
Are you still working at the Bannered Mare in the evenings, Olfina?
Arniel, stay on your guard. We can't let harm come to these people.
At least you remembered one of the things I asked. Let me see that.
Aye, now that there's a beautiful sword. Like a sliver of midnight.
Balgruuf refuses the Legion's right to garrison troops in his city.
Banners, huh? Trying to pretty up the place? All right, you got it.
Begone from here! Get out of this orphanage! Help!Somebody help me!
Between the two of us, his family is better off thinking he's dead.
Brit grah. I had forgotten what fine sport you mortals can provide!
But if you stray from wisdom then to Sovngarde you will not return.
But it seems their criminals can't either and just want to get out.
But Listener... Are you sure? I just can't bring myself to do it...
But now, because of Ulfric's greed, countless lives have been lost.
But thanks to you, he died knowing his life's work was not in vain.
By bringing down my other Hunters, you turned the chase inside out.
By Sithis, but you are a persistent one. Haven't I told you enough?
By the gods, when I get out of here you're dead! You hear me? Dead!
By the Nine, I'd pay good money for a pint of ale to warm my bones!
Come on in. Just stoked the fire. Take a seat and get the cold out.
Come on. Let's go see if there's a mythical dragon buried up there.
Come to chat with an old woman, hmm? Do your good deed for the day?
Cowards, every one of them. Running at the first sign of trouble...
Crime is one thing, murder is another. Mercer will answer for this.
Dahmaan - remember, Alduin also follows his destiny, as he sees it.
Destruction magic's fine, just don't go burning down any buildings.
Do me a favor and kill that little jester twice. Just to make sure.
Do you think we could persuade one of the dragons to join our side?
Don't mind the dogs, they get anxious when they haven't had dinner.
Don't suppose there is. But you don't have to be so damned prickly.
Dwemer blood can loose the hooks, but none alive remain to bear it.
Else you could go see the Jarl's wizard. Might be able to help you.
Enough. Their services will be more than adequate. Let us continue.
Even if it means her leaving Ivarstead, I want Fastred to be happy.
Fancy the leather armor, huh? Something to be said for going light.
Fancy yourself an alchemist, hmm? Never could get the hang of that.
Farengar, you need to come at once. A dragon's been sighted nearby.
For now, I'll hold onto this axe. But it's a tenuous peace at best.
For your crimes, may Malacath boil your blood and grind your bones.
Give us a coin, Cosnach. You'll just spend it on cheap ale, anyway.
Go. Quickly. Hide in the coffin before Cicero and the traitor meet.
Gods, I've lost count of the days. It feels like an age has passed.
Good job! Ulfric was right about you. I'm glad to have you with us!
Good riddance.  Let's move on, the scroll must be in the next room.
Good to have you by my side, friend. I need reliable people around.
Good to see you, my friend! I knew you'd make a proper Legionnaire.
Good, good. These aren't the most glorious jobs, but they pay well.
Ha! Then I'm right. I knew it. He's trying to have somebody killed!
Halt! City's closed with the dragons about. Official business only.
Having another port would ease our supply situation considerably...
He stayed with us for decades... became an uncle of sorts to Aduri.
Heh, I'm sorry. Of course. It's your most famous recipe, after all.
Help the Dark Elves? Oh, you must have heard me talking to Malthyr.
Here you go. Your continued assistance to the cause is appreciated.
Here, let's have Farkas show you where you'll be resting your head.
Here, take this. You've done a good thing for the Riverwood Trader.
Hermir's become a decent smith. Like to think I had a hand in that.
Hey, Talen... get off your lazy tail and take care of the customer!
I am sorry if I disappointed, Harbinger. Still, the battle was won.
I can't take any more of this. No weapons, please. Let's just talk.
I crave a tale of tall ships and fearless heroes, for heart's ease.
I demand that you have this wench removed from my presence at once!
I didn't expect to see you again. What became of my doting husband?
I didn't want to, but she attacked to try and keep me from leaving.
I envy you travelers. Dreams aren't affecting anyone not from here.
I get you, and the Dark Brotherhood gets to continue its existence.
I hear you have spirit. This is good. You may yet join our numbers.
I help my husband Rustleif run the forge. He's a marvel with steel.
I hope that doesn't mean things are going to get worse around here.
I knew it! I knew my father was a hero and he didn't just run away.
I swear, if I ever get out of here, I'm giving up thieving. Really.
I understand Eirid's been playing [QUOTE]Hunt the Elf[QUOTE] again.
I used to wander the corners of Skyrim like you. I miss those days.
I wish Bothela was still running the store. I'm not ready for this.
I wish Elgrim had spent more time tutoring me then that Ingun girl.
I'll be sure and have everything ready. This is exciting, isn't it?
I'll tell you anything. Anything! Just please stop... hurting me...
I'm not about to take on debts from some milk drinker I don't know.
I'm so glad you succeeded. Here. Please take this for your trouble.
I'm sorry to say I know very little about that... bee farm, was it?
I'm sorry to wake you, my Brother. I have a request from Orchendor.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Hammerfell.
I'm sure Pavo would be grateful, and we'd all rest a little easier.
I'm the Steward of Whiterun. I serve Jarl Balgruuf in Dragonsreach.
I'm... Well, who I am isn't important. Let's leave it at that, hmm?
If I'd known it was so important to him, I'd have charged him more.
If I'm not being clear enough, that means we don't want him killed.
If my cleanin' gets in your way, just say the word an' I'll be off.
If they just snuck out of town together, I could manage my husband.
If this isn't about official city business, you're wasting my time.
If we're not going to get Riften, we need you to give us something.
If you need a bow, there's one on the rack to the left of the door.
If you want to be a master pickpocket like me, I can get you there.
If you want to buy something, go find Sabjorn. Otherwise, piss off.
If you want to try, but I'll keep my dagger sharpened just in case.
If you're hungry, Marise sells fresh fish... caught by yours truly.
Igmund was weak. We'll bring the order that the Empire should have.
In fact, if you'd fetch my blade from him I'd be most appreciative.
In my days as a riverboat captain, I was known to run a tight ship.
Is this punishment for my past? Is it Mara's will to torment me so?
It is making patrons nervous. It needs to put the weapon away, now.
It requires a filled black soul gem. You will need to kill someone.
It's a bad time to be a criminal, what with these murders going on.
It's coming along slowly. I expect there will be some results soon.
It's the rush of good fortune, my friend. It makes you work harder.
It's too cold for my bones, but that never seems to stop you, dear.
Jarl can refuse to see me all he likes. He can't ignore us forever.
Just for once, I'd like to see her squirm... to rub her nose in it.
Just think. We're the first to set foot here in thousands of years.
Just those same ruffians I was bringing in for the Shatter-Shields.
Just... just stop. And I'll tell you where I've hidden my treasure.
Keep your eyes open, they'll try to hit us again... I just know it.
Last I heard he intended to pass through Eastmarch on his way here.
Let's go, Galmar. I should have listened to you in the first place.
Let's just keep an eye on the supply. It's such a chore to restock.
Looks like the door will open if we turn these rings the right way.
Madesi, my friend. How have things been since last week's incident?
Make haste to our camp in Whiterun. I want you on the front lines. 
Make it quick, and there might be a bowl of hot stew in it for you.
Markarth is a city of wealth, but gold doesn't follow you in death.
Meet me there. We will fight our way to Namira's embrace together. 
Mind your manners and pay your bills, and you'll always be welcome.
Mind yourself in front of the Jarl, or we'll have serious problems.
My Alembic. I need it for some research, and can't seem to find it.
My cousin's stationed out at the watchtower. I hope he's all right.
My daughter's driving me crazy, so forgive me if I'm a bit on edge.
My dear boy, what makes you think you're getting out of here alive?
My duties keep me busy in Markarth. I don't know if I can help you.
My job is to serve the Jarl, not waste time talking with travelers.
Narfi's sad now. Still wait for Reyda. No more sleep. No, no... no.
Need a horse? I guess I'm the one to talk to, since my da passed...
Nivenor! How can you say that? He gives you everything you ask for.
No, not yet. But I will. I just haven't... gotten around to it yet.
No! You mustn't listen to them. They speak only lies and deception.
No. But neither is every man able to give that order when he must. 
Not here. Let's speak at my home, where we can be alone, unwatched.
Nothing to do here but drink till you forget you got nothing to do.
Now if you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Get going.
Now it is up to you to decide what to do with your power and skill.
Now you can say you've met the most talented bard in all of Skyrim.
Now, if you'll please follow me, I'll show you the living quarters.
Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as mortal, but as dovah!
Of course, there is always work. My mind is someplace else, though.
Of course. I should've known. Avulstein was behind this, wasn't he?
Of course. I've told you before not to bother me with such trifles.
Oh, I thought you were already on your way to Bleak Falls Barrow...
Oh, you know. Little Kjeld is a handful, and Froa is just so quiet.
Oh... all right. If it's so important to you, I suppose I can help.
Oh... well, I'll leave that to you. I trust you know your business.
Once the new owner finds out I gave in, I'm as good as dead anyway.
Only Dagon can declare if a pawn is worth keeping. I. Have. Spoken.
Onmund is too afraid to deal with me himself, and so he's sent you.
Our actions were shameful. Surely, the Night Mother weeps this day.
Please don't bother the Arch-Mage unless it's absolutely necessary.
Please, help Yamarz. Do whatever you can. Our tribe depends on you.
Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the sons and daughters of Skyrim!
Same as the others. Looks like she was stabbed, and then cut apart.
Seems to me they're a bunch of narrow-minded bigots, just like you.
Shame. But, I'm sure one of the whelps around here will take it up.
Shipment of silver this month is behind. Nepos is to blame, not me.
So he has been punished? And what of us? What fate shall we suffer?
So it's okay if your people rebel against the Empire, but not mine?
So that's what's in there? Coins and weapons? How do you know that?
So, Brand-Shei... business as awful for you as it is for all of us?
So, he thinks he can turn Camilla against me? Two can play at this.
So, perhaps you are not entirely useless... We shall soon find out.
Some say the swamp took her. Part of me wishes it were that simple.
Sometimes I just need to remind everyone why I'm the one in charge.
Stabbed in the back. It's like the Dark Brotherhood all over again.
Talos created the Empire. You'd think they'd show him more respect.
Tell me, outsider. Can you banish spirits? For that is what I need.
Tell me, why have you slain those who profess to follow in my ways?
Thank Shor I have a lot of years before I have to worry about that!
Thank the gods for the end of yet another pointless conversation...
Thank you so much! With this coin, I'll be able to double my stock.
Thank you. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for you when you return.
Thank you. Thank you! Azura's Prophecy always guide you to fortune.
That door up ahead... looks perfect for hiding an ambush. Be ready.
That important client Mercer mentioned would be furious if you did.
That's a brave offer. I'd be happy to throw in my coin behind that.
The best way for us to win the Nords' respect is through hard work.
The Dark Brotherhood is on the rise again, Listener. I can feel it.
The daughters of this land are just as strong and loyal as its men.
The Dragonrend Shout is evil. Would you cure one evil with another?
The Jagged Crown! It heralds back to a time before jarls and moots.
The marsh is treacherous. You would do well to not wander at night.
The meads won't argue your ear off about which one should go first!
The patrols never seem to give us time to be alone, the nosy pests.
The stench in here... this place smells of death. Be on your guard.
Then, as I've said, 1000 gold will be required to set things right.
There are places in the world that aren't wrapped in ice, you know.
There were six of us. Full of ambition, eager to conquer the world.
There's not enough drinking in the world today, wouldn't you agree?
These wizards are mad beyond reason. They understand only violence.
This place has had you shaking in your armor ever since we arrived.
This, this is why people have a problem with your college, Nelacar.
Those bastards will regret raising their weapons against Jorrvaskr.
Those flames get out of control, and you're gonna wish they hadn't.
To return to our glory and traditions, to determine our own future!
Tried making some myself, but I'm no good with the forge and anvil.
Typical outlander weakling. But your gold will strengthen our clan.
Uglarz is a great huntress. Perhaps she can teach me something new.
Ulfric Stormcloak is victorious, and the Jarls have fallen in line.
Unless you're bringin' me another round, you can just keep walking.
Unmid, my sweet. Are we still meeting later for... combat training?
Very good. I'll trust you to get there in one piece. Don't be long.
Very well. I can't stop you. But I can't bear to watch it, either. 
We are Lord Boethiah's faithful. Have you come to test your mettle?
We got rooms and food. Drink, too. I cook. Ain't much else to tell.
We tunneled into an old crypt. We're warning strangers to keep out.
We'd better go see. These can tend to themselves for a few minutes.
We'd better push on. I'm sure the others will find another way out.
We'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation.
We'll stand guard out here and rush in as soon as we hear fighting.
We're the best damned fighters in Skyrim. At least, some of us are.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Cave Bear pelts.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Sabre Cat pelts.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Snow Bear pelts.
We've got strong swords and sturdy armor, if you're looking to buy.
Welcome. There are many things here that cannot be found elsewhere.
Well, aren't you the pretty one. I bet all the men chase after you.
Well, he's been very busy. Perhaps today he'll have some free time.
Well, I suppose we can't just stand here. We'd better do something.
Well, I'd better get back to work. You two make yourselves at home.
Well, look who it is. Been keeping out of trouble much? I hope not!
What do you aim to do with that hammer, friend? Knock down a house?
When you're hungry, you'll look anywhere for food. Can't blame her.
When you're hungry, you'll look anywhere for food. Can't blame him.
Whiterun belongs to the true sons of Skyrim now, just as it should.
Why are you still standing there? Hurry, before the meeting begins.
Winterhold may not look impressive, but it has a very rich history.
Wise is the one who spends a few coins now to make a fortune later.
Wow. Yeah. That sounds great, mother. Only, um... it's just that...
Yamarz refuses help, but I sense that you may be just what we need.
Yes, I'm afraid we're aware of Sarthis's presence in the warehouse.
Yes, Listener. I'll return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary without delay.
Yes, master. I'm sorry, I'll get back to those notes straight away.
You and me, we're the only people around who aren't complete fools.
You deal with powerful forces. Take care they do not overwhelm you.
You don't want to talk to me. I'm just a stand in for a dead Thane.
You gave us even more trouble than Farkas did at his first turning.
You get killed on account of this thing, it's not my fault. Got it?
You have some nerve coming back here after what you did to Keerava.
You have to remember, it's not about strength. It's about leverage.
You have wax in your ears? I said no one dies. We're not assassins.
You might do well to learn a smaller weapon. Vary your style a bit.
You see any other inns around here? Where else would I go to drink?
You should bring this information to the Thieves Guild immediately.
You should see my mother, Sharamph, if you need a cure or a poison.
You the sneaky type? Got some nice daggers around here somewhere...
You think that even if I did have one here, I would let you see it?
You were with us on the carts, weren't you? Not your lucky day, eh?
You wield... Azura's Star? How... how can such a thing be possible?
You wouldn't have a few minutes to run down to the docks would you?
You'll look back on this as one of your best decisions, I swear it.
You'll never see the sun again. No one escapes Cidhna Mine. No one.
You're going to happen by and lend poor old Sabjorn a helping hand.
You're not an Orc, or Blood-Kin, so stay out. We only help our own.
You're right, I saw it. Didn't want to believe my own eyes, is all.
You've been spending a fair bit of time with Sergius lately, I see.
You've come this far, so I see no harm in concealing it any longer.
You've no right to be here. This place is for Orcs. And Orcs alone.
You've not seen the night sky until you've seen it on the open sea.
You've sent an innocent man to jail. I hope your proud of yourself.
[QUOTE]But Solitude stood strong, Skyrim's truest protectors.[QUOTE]
Ah, good, good. Now please, take this. Just my way of saying thanks.
Ah, no mere brute mercenary, but a thinker - perhaps even a scholar?
Alduin escaped us long ago. Today we take our well-tempered revenge.
Another uncounted causality of this war. Here you are, you poor man.
Any further dishonor done to my kin, and I'll put you in the ground.
Anyway, I can smell the smoke. They've already set the place alight.
Anyway, our wares are strong and the prices fair. What else matters?
Are you loyal to Skyrim? Break into Lod's house and get that letter.
Arngeir. Rek los Dovahkiin, Strundu'ul. Rek fen tinvaak Paarthurnax.
Arngeir. Rok los Dovahkiin, Strundu'ul. Rok fen tinvaak Paarthurnax.
As you command, my lord. But, the issue could be solved another way.
Azura's Star! I knew the Lady of Twilight had sent you for a reason.
Back off. You don't want to know what happens to troublemakers here.
Because life was better under the old ways. No Nords and their laws.
Been mining all my life. Quicksilver is as much my home as anywhere.
Before we get down to business, I've got something I need you to do.
Between the dragons and the Stormcloaks, my coffers are running dry.
Beyond these doors is the inner sanctum and the Skull of Corruption.
Big shipment coming in later tonight. I need you three working late.
Bring back this tablet that Farengar wants and I'll be in your debt.
Brynjolf, have you had a chance to speak to our contact in Whiterun?
But more importantly, wards have saved lives. This is a simple fact.
But more will come. Bring him down, for the glories of Lord Hircine.
But three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe.
But you might be able to butter them up enough to lower their guard.
By opening that gate for Ulfric you betrayed the people of Solitude.
By the Eight! It's gone, everything's gone! Get in here, all of you!
By the gods, I feel like I could crush a giant's head like a walnut.
By the gods... you! But it can't be. You're dead. You... Yeaaaahhhh!
Can't say that I have. Imagine the riches hidden within these walls.
Come and browse my fine selection! Everything's fresh and delicious!
Come now, you've got your orders. What else could you possibly need?
Come now. What everyone else is saying. It can't possibly be true...
Constance Michel says we have to be careful of people we don't know.
Control yourself! Do not frighten away our customers with your fits.
Crush, clobber, slash or slice. We've got a weapon for any occasion.
Did you ever have to fight off bandits, Frida? Like in your stories?
Don't worry, citizen. I'm on top of that little matter we discussed.
Dorthe needs to spend more time in the garden. I could use the help.
Enthir... Gallus's friend at the College of Winterhold. Of course...
Falkreath is a hard place and tending a farm here is thankless work.
Farewell, Nightingale. See to it the Key stays this time, won't you?
Fascinating! Original Akaviri bas-reliefs... almost entirely intact!
Forgive me, my lord. It was foolish of me to make such a suggestion.
Get moving. I shudder to think what might happen if you're too late.
Gonna get cold tonight. Might want to at least cover your delicates.
Good luck. Come to Windhelm and talk to Ulfric. You won't regret it.
Good work. Get ready while I have a word with our favorite outsider.
Greetings, sister Elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home.
Grelod is the headmistress of Honorhall Orphanage. But not for long.
Guard might get nervous, a woman approaches with her weapon drawn...
Had I intended to kill you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Have no idea what my birth name really is, and I frankly don't care.
Have your weapon at the ready. I'm certain Karliah knows we're here.
He got some letter from the Legion and has left it alone since then.
He must have returned to Sovngarde to feed on the souls of the dead.
He's the world's master of the nature of Elder Scrolls, but... well.
Healthy and strong. Ysgramor's coat's gotten so thick, he looks fat!
Hey, Breton. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey. That armor. You got rid of it, yeah? I can take it, no problem?
Hmm. I still don't like it, but I guess I'll overlook it. This time.
How can we fight Alduin? Doesn't his return mean it's the end times?
I bet you'll be glad to get to Whiterun and get out of this weather.
I can afford to buy meat now. I prefer working in the mines, anyway.
I can assure you, it's all fresh. I hunt the game myself, every day.
I can't believe Fastred ran off to Riften with that... that bastard.
I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You made the best of a bad situation.
I don't know how Ghorbash has so much spirit. He should act his age.
I don't... I haven't mother's gift, not quite, but I've seen things.
I had to. The farmers are charging me double for the produce I sell.
I hate bandits and thieves. Men like these raid our town every year.
I have already defeated your friends once. Beyn. I do not fear them.
I have no idea, but it's fascinating. Assuming it's true, of course.
I hear they accept most people who apply, if you're ever interested.
I hope one comes running up here so I can stab it right in the face.
I hope you can change my father's mind. He can be a little stubborn.
I hope you'll agree that these dark deeds are best left forgotten...
I know Thieves Guild armor when I see it. You're not fooling anyone.
I know you. Where was it? Hm. Oh! You were getting something for me?
I know you're up there. Go get the treasure. Doesn't it look pretty?
I know, dear. He's a busy man, though, and loyal to the Stormcloaks.
I lost my eye defending the Empire... Spare some grub for a veteran?
I lost my twin sister a while back. Have you ever lost anyone close?
I say we go down there and clear the place out, just like old times.
I spend every waking moment making sure the mine is put to good use.
I suppose you deserve it. Couldn't do any worse than Mercer, anyway.
I was blinded. Blinded by dark treachery masquerading as friendship.
I will hear no more of this, Harrald. Do you understand me? No more!
I will take you down too. I am not splitting this horde with anyone.
I would refuse, but I don't want to jeopardize the peace between us.
I... I'm sorry! Your clothes... of course... I should have realized!
I'll add it to the list of things I need to take care of. Thank you.
I'll be fine. I just need a minute to catch my breath. Find Savos...
I'll bet Bassianus would know what's going on. He understands women.
I'll start translating it. Shouldn't take me more than a day or two.
I'll tell everyone we're ready but we'll start the festival at dusk.
I'm a strict follower of the old traditions. Honor, strength, deeds.
I'm just surprised. But your strength and honor are apparent to all.
I'm not going anywhere.  Now back off before I do something drastic.
I'm not interested, Jaree. It doesn't matter how many times you ask.
I'm really not in the mood. State your business, or take your leave.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Black Marsh.
I'm sworn to protect you, my Jarl, but I'm the last line of defense.
I'm telling you, I don't... wait, what's this ring? This isn't mine!
I'm telling you, I heard it. Howling. Those werewolf tales are true.
I'm very disappointed. I'd advise you to rethink that decision soon.
I'm willing to let the Dragonborn decide the fairness of my request.
I've been cleaning up spills and there is fresh linen for the rooms.
I've got one all saddled up for you! What do you figure she's worth?
I've just never heard of a midwife losing all her mothers like that.
I've tasted your food, Odar. It's better than most songs I've heard.
If I were you, I'd go straight to the steward with this information.
If there's nothing else, I really do have important matters tend to.
If we run into any Imperials, just let me do the talking, all right?
If you ever want to replace those old rags, stop by Radiant Raiment.
If you find Mercer, give no quarter... kill him and be done with it.
If you're looking to purchase any mead, speak to the owner, Sabjorn.
If your allegiance lies with the Empire, we haven't much to discuss.
If, however, you seek something more, I will be happy to assist you.
In charge of what? I'm in charge of me, and you're in charge of you.
In fact, they didn't seem to care much for anyone who wasn't a Nord.
In that case, I'm pretty sure it tried to buy me a drink last night.
Indeed. We lost three soldiers in that attack. A sad day for Riften.
Inside, my friend, inside! Where only the women and drinks are cold.
Is that right? Here's how the Legion deals with rebel scum like you.
Is there anything on the claw that might show how to open this door?
It doesn't matter. Look, it's refilling with your tonic as we speak.
It takes a lot of confidence to walk around naked. Trust me on that.
It was the Falmer, wasn't it? Curse them! They've ruined everything!
It's as if the merchandise and coin are simply falling from the sky.
It's as rewarding as it is dangerous. Let's see what I can show you.
It's good to hear you say that. I wish my wife was as simple as you.
It's good to toughen her up. Not an easy world out here. Keep at it.
It's great to see you again! It's been too quiet without you around.
It's lies. All of it. I don't care what she told you, it's all lies.
It's like an animal got to her, but these are the wounds of a blade.
J'zargo continues to struggle with wards. You have time to practice?
J'zargo had expected to be named Arch-Mage. But there is still time.
Jarl Baalgruf, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?
Keep doing right by us and there's plenty more where that came from.
Lady Haelga, so pleased to see you. Your Marks of Dibella are ready.
Lars, dear, why don't you go outside and play? It's a beautiful day.
Last person who made trouble for Vekel ended up with a smashed head.
Let me know. We shouldn't stay here all day. My men want their mead.
Let's not waste too much time talking when there is glory to be had.
Like they knew exactly where we'd be. That was... two days ago, now.
Listen up, spy! You're trapped in here, and we have your accomplice.
Living as beasts draws our souls closer to the Daedric Lord Hircine.
Look at you. Come crawling back, after everything you've done to me?
Look, I don't really know you. I don't even really know anyone here.
Make your way to our camp in Falkreath. We're going to take it back.
Mathies. I wanted to say I'm sorry about what happened to your girl.
Maybe we should just admit that this is a horrible place for a mill.
Meat Pies. Try one for free, come back for more. Get your meat pies.
Mining is hard work, but we pay a fair price for any ore you dig up.
My boy Lars has been getting beat senseless, and by a girl, no less!
My dear girl, what makes you think you're getting out of here alive?
My loyalty lies with Solitude. So where Jarl Elisif leads, I follow.
My sweet Leanora, I will never let anything happen to us. I promise.
No funerals, just some pain. If you get caught, it's not my problem.
No more than that. I don't want to hear about a killing, understand?
No, not really. Couriers don't seem to like delivering letters here.
No, that won't be necessary. You'll have compensation for your loss.
Nocturnal calls me to the Evergloam. My contract has been fulfilled.
Not like this. Feels colder than usual. Bet it's those damned Mages.
Not long, but you can't start casting with a fireball coming at you.
Not this Empire. The world's better without it. Certainly Skyrim is.
Now get going... I don't want to see your face until the job's done.
Now get out of here and don't come back until your pockets are full.
Now that I think of it, she would have made a fine Imperial general.
Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as khajiit, but as dovah!
Now, thanks to my mother's generosity, this city is making its mark.
Oh come now, this is mead... not some wine to be sipped and savored.
Oh my, I very nearly got us both into a nasty predicament, didn't I?
Oh what am I going do? I can barely afford to stay at the Bunkhouse.
Oh yes. After all, what's the point in being miserable all the time?
Oh, you wanted the attic room? Why didn't you say so the first time?
One night Ranmir was in here like always, drinking himself to death.
One of these days, we'll have to find you a good woman like my Olda.
Only when you're around. The rest of these fools I could do without.
Perfect. This is just what I needed. Here's some gold for your time.
Perhaps you should let a father decide what is best for his own son.
Please, I don't have anything to pay you with! Don't destroy my urn!
Please, let's hurry to the Temple before the Forsworn find me again.
Please, please... hold all your questions until after I've finished!
Really? What did you go and do that for? You... you need to go away.
Remember, Sabjorn will be needing a helping hand. Make it look good.
Remind me why we even bother to allow him to be a part of the Guild.
Restore to me my beacon, that I might guide you toward your destiny.
See the inn on the other side? Jump through the roof and keep going!
See, he's living with Alva now. That started the day after the fire.
Skyrim needs that king. You will be that king, Ulfric. You must be. 
So you have the Voice, then? I would be quite impressed to see that.
So you're off to find some staff now? I don't see the point of that.
So, have you gotten Nettlebane back from those filthy Hagravens yet?
Some rich folk had a trinket stolen and they want us to get it back.
Someday, I'll be a gallant heroine. You make it look so.. appealing.
Stormblade. I want you to have my sword, a token of my appreciation.
Such blasphemies are the calling of mages, not followers of the Way.
Sulla look, the passage is open, wait... there's someone down there!
Take it. Take the coat, have your fun. I'll see you at the festival.
Take the mark if you want it. It's not worth all this hassle anyway.
Thank you! Thank you! I'll never speak of this to anyone, I promise!
That it was black and gross and nobody wanted to live there anymore.
That was a simple misunderstanding, but this item is the real thing.
That's no business of yours, son. Mind you keep your nose out of it.
That's Vokun, the guardian of the scroll.  It must be just past him.
That's your best offer? I suppose so. She's the one with the saddle.
The Dragon from the dawn of time, who devours the souls of the dead!
The pain's a little less than before, but it still hurts bad enough.
The three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe.
Then the hunger set in. Curiosity. What's the harm in just one bite?
There is a copse of elms to the east. We could really use that wood.
There'd better be. I didn't come all this way to leave empty handed.
There's a nip in the air. Cold won't be good for my crops. Never is.
There's fine steel at the Scorched Hammer, if you fancy a new blade.
There's got to be something in that house of theirs. I just know it.
There's two things to do at the Flagon: spend coin and then get out.
These sands are cold, but Khajiit feels warmness from your presence.
They have a dark elf who oversees their operations. Suvaris Atheron.
They represent the reason I'm here. I can't just ignore them, Aerin.
They say that eating the fruit it bears will add years to your life.
They should have drawn it out some more. He deserved a slower death.
Think hard about your loyalties, sister. I expected better from you.
This better not be another waste of the Guild's resources, Brynjolf.
This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors. Now go away.
This is the prayer heard by the goddess and relayed to her servants.
This war is such nonsense. All this fuss over their false human god.
Thongvor's made me his housecarl. Remember, me killing you is legal.
Though I admit, I find her Keeper a bit too exuberant for my liking.
Thus we must take certain precautions in order to secure our safety.
To kill a pirate captain, on her own ship no less? Simply masterful!
To me as well. I think we don't see the same tradition at play here.
Uh oh. A fellow bard. I best not miss my notes or forget any lyrics.
Ulfric once tried to get me to fight for him, but marching bores me.
Um... I was thinking you might like this. Here. It's nothing really.
Unless it's gold for another round of drinks, I don't wanna hear it.
Used to have run-ins with the guards, now they have run-ins with me.
Very well, just let me know when you're ready to purchase the house.
Walking around like that is why magic gets a bad name. Shame on you.
We can't afford to lose our heads... we need to calm down and focus.
We can't hold them back! Go! Get to the Barrier! Release the Miasma!
We do this for the good of Skyrim and her people. Never forget that.
We may be small, but what we lack in size we make up for in quality.
We should go over our strategy again in case the Stormcloaks attack.
We supply Falkreath to the south. Until recently we supplied Helgen.
We're united, but where should we live? My home is yours, of course.
We've got troubles enough without the Thalmor and their witch-hunts.
We've talked about speed and composure. Now we'll go over precision.
Welcome to Bits and Pieces. I'm sure you'll find what you need here.
Well then, what are you waiting for? Get in there and earn your pay.
Well what did you go dropping it for? Got my hopes up for nothin'...
What happened is between you, me, and Azura. Let's keep it that way.
What kind of filthy barbarian just throws their trash on the ground?
What's the matter? You can't stand the sight of a strong Nord woman?
Whatever you want to know, I don't care. I run a smelter. That's it.
Whatever you're about to say, don't bother. I don't want to hear it.
When will I learn how to forge weapons and armor? Isn't that my job?
When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid, we'll embrace once again.
Winterhold was once the capital of Skyrim, you know. Quite an honor.
Winterhold's glory days may lie behind it, but the College lives on.
With Irileth, you either come back covered with glory or not at all.
With this terrible war, I'm a bit overwhelmed. As are the catacombs.
Without the coin to pack up and leave, I decided to take to trading.
Worst thing is, nobody wants them in the cities. Nobody trusts them.
Yeah, yeah. Goodbye, kill lots of people, Hail Sithis, and all that.
Yes, I'm a powerful wizard. No, I won't put on a magic show for you.
Yes, master, I know. I just want to keep up my own projects as well.
Yes. An axe. How long have you been in Skyrim. Give the man my axe. 
Yes. My collection of artifacts from a group that toppled an Empire.
Yes. Now that you're a Nightingale, you may consider this your home.
You already got what you wanted, you damn hound. This is your fault.
You already have someone to do your fighting for you. Don't need me.
You are a good friend to have done this. J'zargo will not forget it.
You attacked one of my family. What do you have to say for yourself?
You buy my way out of here, and I'll tell you what you want to know.
You didn't know? That was Ulfric Stormcloak and his top lieutenants.
You don't see many people crafting with that these days. Impressive.
You had best tell the Jarl in Whiterun. He needs to know about this.
You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Sister.
You have completed your training, Dragonborn. We would Speak to you.
You have it! The blessed Wabbajack! You must use it on me. You must.
You know, I like it here. We should have moved to Dawnstar ages ago.
You must go to a fortress, endangered by water, yet untouched by it.
You must speak with Astrid. Here, in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary.
You need anything, come see me. I'm as resourceful as I am discreet.
You see, you're not well! Have a seat and I'll fetch you some tonic.
You should just serve your time. Find an ore vein and start digging.
You should talk to Anton if you need anything. He's the master chef.
You want anything in this life, you gotta take it. Just not from me.
You will not stop me from killing those who wage this pointless war!
You won't be intimidating me into lower prices. Put that thing away.
You would? Well then, I would insist on rewarding you for your time.
You'd better come in and tell me how you found me and what you want.
You're either the bravest person I've ever met, or the biggest fool.
You're in the wrong place to be asking those kind of questions, pal.
...need me some skooma... the imported stuff... just one last time...

A few dark elves getting shoved around doesn't really amount to much.
A marriage of both love and political advantage. A rare thing indeed.
Ah yes, the extract, good. Poisonous, of course, but it has its uses.
Ah, Borkul muscle one out of you on your way in? Fine. Take this one.
Ah, hello my Khajiit friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?
Ah, hello there, traveler. Come to the Nightgate for food or lodging?
Ah, smell that fresh air? Truly, this is a good place to play a song.
Ah, welcome to Angela's Aromatics. Can I help with some herbal needs?
All from inside Cidhna Mine. A Nord prison. The irony is quite thick.
All right, all right! No need to get violent. We're on the same side.
All right, snowback. Who are you, and what are you doing in my tower?
All the apiaries... it will take years to get those bees happy again.
All them women, keeping to themselves. Won't let poor Degaine in, no.
Always glad to talk to the bard who returned part of the Poetic Edda.
And what? You couldn't read it yourself? Fine, give it here a moment.
Another member of the Family! Hello, hello. So very good to meet you.
Another second out there with the dragon, and they'd both be dead....
Apparently some Nord women were murdered. Not sure why I should care.
Arkay. One of the Eight Divines. God of the Cycle of Birth and Death.
As a Nightingale, I've been sworn to secrecy regarding the Sepulcher.
As I get closer to the Ebonmere I begin to feel myself slipping away.
Bah. You're always working. Why else would I spend so much time here?
Be careful with Sapphire. She's mixes with all sorts of nasty people.
Be wary for traps. If you spy one, try to get an enemy to trigger it.
Because that's... crazy. You do realize who you're dealing with here?
Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas.
Both my daughters. Now my wife? How much is one man supposed to take?
But at the same time, I don't dare refuse an invitation from Elenwen.
But I'm sure you've got plenty to keep you busy right about now, hmm?
But it's not for everyone to hear. Meet me in the Underforge tonight.
But no one else has brought you such valuable information, have they?
But what I ask of you... it must be done. There is too much at stake.
But why did they take her? What could they want with our little girl?
But you should know that we have a more pressing matter to deal with.
Calixto, do you know if there's any truth to these rumors of dragons?
Can you believe one person came in here and took out this whole camp?
Careful, huh? Thanks, Skulvar. I'll remember that. Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Changed your mind? Well, I can't give up so easily. I'm heading back.
Come on! You know you want what's in that chest. Just walk toward it!
Darling! I've been waiting for you to return, to consummate our love!
Don't need to pay me no mind. I'm the least important person in here.
Don't talk about my father like that, Jon. And the answer's still no.
Edda, you know well I barely have any coin to call my own. I'm sorry.
Elenwen puts a great deal of effort into these parties, and it shows.
Enough posturing, Tullius. If you came to talk, let's get on with it.
Everyone in town knows about the Black Door, and to never go near it.
Exactly. With Sabjorn in prison, his meadery will be forced to close.
Excuse me, I'm trying to watch a traitor to the Empire lose his head.
Faida's teaching me the innkeeper's trade. She runs the Four Shields.
Feast your eyes on my strange and wondrous collection of curiosities.
Finally, we can reopen the mine and put Shor's Stone back on the map!
Fine. Whatever you want. Can't you just kill me and get it over with?
For what it's worth, I'm sorry to see you go. You fought well for us.
Forgive me. You're just the one in charge, and it's what I'm used to.
Forgive Ugor's harsh words. She is merely doing as she has been told.
General Tullius expects much of me, and thus I expect much of my men.
Give me a minute to examine the Star. I'll see what we'll need to do.
Gladly. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Sister to the Orcs.
Good. I hope it hurt a lot, after all the pain I've been put through.
Got some good pieces out here, if you're looking to buy. More inside.
Gotta keep my eyes open. Damned dragons could swoop down at any time.
Grant us this power so that in your name we may vanquish our enemies.
Greetings, brother Elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home.
Greetings, honored friend. Could I interest you in some fine jewelry?
Guess the headsman's been busy with all your friends. Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha! No matter! Honestly, I don't want to know. Why ruin the surprise?
Hail, sister! I saw you walking there and thought you could use this.
Have you given Malborn the gear you want to smuggle into the embassy?
He needs to die. He deserves to die. And it falls to you to kill him.
He'll do no such thing! A dagger in the back is all you could expect!
Hey, Khajiit. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, kinsman. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, Razelan, remember when you told me I'd never amount to anything?
Hey, you approached me. You want to play coward, that's your problem.
Hmph. I had you figured for a mage. I think you'll appreciate this...
Hold, comrades - let us counsel take before battle is blindly joined.
Home again, home again! I'll return to the Night Mother straightaway!
How can Elda hate the dark elves when she knows so little about them?
How do we know he's not spying for the Battle-Born? This was foolish!
How do you think we should spend the remainder of our classroom time?
I already knew Delvin, I asked if I could join up, and that was that.
I appreciate the delivery, here... I want you to have this. I insist.
I can promise you when he's ready, he'll find the cell door unlocked.
I can take the pieces back to my museum. Seal them in a display case.
I can't believe Fastred's gone. I... I should have been nicer to her.
I couldn't be more pleased. Take this small token of my appreciation.
I damn well hope so. If it helps you twist them up, I'm glad to help.
I don't suppose I could convince you to take care of it now, could I?
I expected no less of you. And once again, you have not disappointed.
I forgive your not knowing my name. Few can hear my whispers anymore.
I have Gallus's journal. I think you'll find its contents disturbing.
I hope Falk made it clear that Solitude owes you a debt of gratitude.
I hope Vignar doesn't find them. He'll ask a king's ransom, I'm sure.
I hoped to avoid involving them in this, but we have no other choice.
I keep hearing stories about Morrowind. Sounds like a wretched place.
I killed scores of the Empire's men before I was forced to surrender.
I knew it... Mercer sent you to kill me! Guards, there's an intruder!
I know full well that you have. Please do not insult my intelligence.
I know what you said, but I only wanted to speak to him for a moment.
I love the man, bless his heart, but he doesn't know the whole story.
I must have broken five or six pickaxes in the last few months alone.
I must now show them the path that will lead us back to our strength.
I need to return to the source of the problem, to Nightcaller Temple.
I still do. I just like to have food waiting for me when I come home.
I suppose you intend to carry off every item of value in these ruins.
I thought I was caught, but she started telling me even more secrets.
I took that prancing fool into my home, and this is how he repays me?
I trust you found your journey to Winterhold not entirely unpleasant.
I wish everyone could just get past that and get on with their lives.
I wouldn't do that again unless you know for sure it's going to open.
I... I'm sorry. I just, well, the forge gets so hot and I thought....
I'd like nothing more than to see Winterhold regain its former glory.
I'll always have fruit to buy. Until it goes rotten. Then... I won't.
I'll be sure to put in a good word if I get to Windhelm ahead of you.
I'll just wait here and make sure nothing foul escapes the catacombs.
I'll look over this later. Why don't you take this, for your trouble?
I'll speak with Aela about how you handled yourself. Come back later.
I'm a writer by trade. Not that the people of Skyrim do much reading.
I'm afraid he's asked to not be disturbed. He has important business.
I'm going to tell father you said that. He'll tan your hide for sure!
I'm in charge of Left Hand Mine. You cause trouble, you answer to me.
I'm in the middle of something. But don't go far. I'll need you soon.
I'm just a poor old woman, dear. No need to trouble yourself with me.
I'm not going to sugar-coat it for you. We're in a bad way down here.
I'm quite aware of what's going on here, and I will not stand for it!
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do something like that. Even for you.
I'm truly grateful. Please accept this as a token of my appreciation.
I've been here 50 years, and nothing is going to move me off my land.
I've been sent by Silver-Bloods to keep this mine [QUOTE]safe.[QUOTE]
I've figured out how we're going to get you into the Thalmor Embassy.
I've got another special request and they specifically asked for you.
I've heard stories about the wonders of the great Temple in Markarth.
If anyone will know what the coming of the dragon means, it's Ulfric.
If I see Frey, I'll pluck his eyes from his skull with my bare hands!
If it's work you need, how about chopping up some wood for the fires?
If that's not enough, I suppose... I have this amulet you could take.
If we spend less on new arms and armor for the guards, for example...
If we're not going to get Markarth, we need you to give us something.
If you can see your destiny clearly, your sight is clearer than mine.
If you wanna be a damn fool, go to the College in Winterhold instead.
If you're looking for a handout, you're not going to get one from me.
If you're thinking of setting up to farm, you picked the right place.
If you're working on any experiments, please clean up after yourself.
If you've business with the Jarl, I'd ask that you speak to me first.
If you've got the coin, you're welcome here. Otherwise, hit the road.
In fact, I'm glad you're here. There's something I'd like to ask you.
Is this about the stables? My husband, Geimund, handles the business.
It doesn't happen again, or else I'll have you thrown in jail. Clear?
It isn't just your blood that a vampire wants, it's your mortal soul.
It would be best if we spoke little until you've completed your task.
It's a hard way to make a living, but we find ways to make ends meet.
It's just a flute. A really old and valuable flute, but just a flute.
It's no secret that the College's reputation in Skyrim is... tainted.
It's the least I can do for your help in putting this matter to rest.
It's those damned Blackblood Marauders. They're scaring off shipping.
Jarl Maven Black-Briar. Has a pleasant sound to it, wouldn't you say?
Just in time. This is Adelaisa, one of my superiors from the Company.
Just talk to him; see if you can convince him to give my amulet back.
Just... Do whatever it takes to get him to stop lording this over me.
Let's also pretend that he traded some valuable items for said staff.
Let's improve the fit. Take this leather to the workbench over there.
Look at them. The legendary sharpness of a deadric weapon. Marvelous.
Lost it? Well, at least you showed signs of initiative by telling me.
Lost the last one I gave you? Very well, here you are. Mara keep you.
May you carry the warmth of Mara to all corners of the frozen wastes.
Might want to put it away that weapon... unless you plan on using it.
Moons protect us! I hope we do not encounter one of them on the road.
Morthal will be mine to govern someday. I have a great deal to learn.
Most women would rather die than dig, but I have a daughter to raise.
My boy fancies that Camilla Valerius. She'll come around soon enough.
My daughter Adara is going to be a fine silversmith when she's older.
My orders are to tell the riff-raff to use the North Gate, that's it.
My sources tell me you can find that book in a study in his quarters.
My title is just a formality. I've always been in charge around here.
New to Riverwood? If you're looking for work, go see Hod at the mill.
No Empire is going to take the Jarlship away from this Son of Skyrim.
No Nord could have said it better! I'll stand beside you, Dragonborn.
No use thinkin' of things I can't change. Too much work to be done...
No! I'm not about to let you ruin everything I've worked so hard for!
No. I'm sorry, I've worked too damn hard to let his life go to waste.
None of what he collected tasted as good as your Spiced Wine, Evette.
Not much. I came here a few years ago from Hammerfell when I married.
Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as Argonian, but as dovah!
Of course, I have everything you need for sale, if you have the coin.
Of course... otherwise it wouldn't be much of a reward, now would it?
Oh dear, whatever is a girl to do with such fearful brutes about her?
Oh, look. It's the entrance to a dwarven city. I've heard stories....
Okay, now can you let me out? Please? I won't tell anyone it was you.
One of the terms of the treaty was the outlawing of worship to Talos.
One time, I almost cut a finger off sharpening a blade. I hate blood.
Only burglars and vampires creep around after dark. So which are you?
Only the foolish or the courageous approach a Jarl without summons...
Please place your hands on the altar. Azura wishes to speak with you.
Posh. I'm not paying for it. Put it on Bolli's account if you please.
Reburrus, I need you to draft a letter to Ulfric requesting more men.
Runs the Blood Horkers, and makes sure the battles end right-side up.
See? He agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?
Sir, you must tell her! You don't know what they'll do to me! Please!
Slow's the only way to do it! Work too hard and you'll warp the wood.
So far, if only because no one is telling me how great I ought to be.
So... a Dragonborn appears, at this moment in the turning of the age.
Stand fast! The fell worm's death is ours at last, the light returns!
Stendarr's Mercy! This isn't an ordinary Daedra. We have to get help.
Still alive, prisoner? Keep close to me if you want to stay that way.
Such is our way! Such is the ancient custom of Skyrim, and all Nords!
Surprised to see you working. Mulush almost broke your arm yesterday.
Take the giant's hammer to Atub, and tell her what has happened here.
Thank Talos you came along... I thought I was going to die down here.
Thank you, Laila. I wanted to discuss the protection of my shipments.
Thank you. Here. You honored my mother's task and should be rewarded.
Thank you. Here's your gold. I'll make a run for it back to Dawnstar.
That may be, but what of the war? That is not so easy to escape from.
That was the voice of the Greybeards, summoning you to High Hrothgar!
That's the spirit. Find her and I promise you'll be well compensated.
The arrangement called for a trade. I hope you'll find this suitable.
The Black-Briars have been instrumental in keeping Riften on the map.
The College of Winterhold is truly an asset to our city... err, town.
The Dark Mistress? She sent you? Wait. Molag Bal's altar. Of course. 
The first thing we need to do is figure out who's behind the dragons.
The Forsworn know every stone in the Reach. We have to wait them out.
The gold is flowing nicely. Here's your half of the profits, my dear.
The imperial butchers are on their way. Get home and lock your doors!
The Imperials are good for business, and business is good for Skyrim.
The ivory from this tusk will be perfect for the inlay on my amulets.
The Jarl is, as you can imagine, very busy. Perhaps I can assist you?
The Jarl's court wizard was taught there. That one's full of secrets.
The Key! You have the Skeleton Key! I never thought I'd see it again.
The path to Paarthurnax is perilous, not to be embarked upon lightly.
The people here are still plagued with nightmares. It's... unnatural.
The Ratway is somewhere under Riften, shouldn't be too tough to find.
The road takes us past many cold rivers. We can fill our skins there.
The war has changed Falkreath, even our neighbors can be our enemies.
There's enough real troubles in the world without making new ones up.
There's no time. We've got to get you out of here! Come on, let's go!
These dreams are manifestations created by the Daedric Lord Vaermina.
They call the path to the monastery the 7,000 Steps. Can you imagine?
They should be back shortly. You're welcome to wait here if you like.
They think he did it to get rid of his wife so he could be with Alva.
They'll continue to strike out at us, whenever and wherever they can.
Think hard about your loyalties, brother. I expected better from you.
This godsforsaken war is dividing our people and destroying our land.
This is life, sister. The struggle is what reminds us to draw breath.
This is most inappropriate! We are involved in serious research here!
This one has something sweet for the fellow traveler, if it entices. 
Those Dark Elf refugees will take over the city if we aren't careful.
To me, it means not having to answer foolish questions a second time.
To receive the blessing of Talos, you have only to pray at the altar.
To return to its past glory, it must first drink the blood of deceit.
Unless you're here to solve this nightmare problem, I don't need you.
Unless, of course, that was your goal all along. Here's your payment.
Very well, I trust that you wouldn't be here were it not significant.
Wanderer like you needs a little fire in the veins. Some spiced wine?
We are bonded now, you and I. Joined, through the powers of the Void.
We can head back whenever you're set. There's celebrating to be done!
We could always use help picking crops if you need a few extra coins.
We have Shield-Siblings to keep our backs as dangerous as our fronts.
We know full well about your investment in shipping ventures, Erikur.
We must be near the entrance for that bear to have made its den here.
Well, look at us, getting married. Life in Skyrim ain't all bad, huh?
Well... fine. I wasn't really gonna do anything with it anyway. Hmph.
Well...that's disappointing. This one didn't survive the fall either.
Wh- no... I.... Oh, by the Eight, fine. But only to the edge of town!
What do you think you're doing? Knock it off with the flames already.
What? The Listener? What are you going on about? What is this lunacy?
What? You, alone, reasoning with the Thalmor? That's madness, friend.
When you've completed all those, we'll see if I might have some more.
Where oh where did you get this? Don't answer - I don't want to know.
Will we be dining together this evening after my work at the fishery?
With this the world could have a better understanding of the Dwemer! 
Wonderful. I was afraid I'd have to give up, and when I'm so close...
Wonderful. This will be a splendid addition to my private collection.
Yes, my Brother. Forgive me. May the blessing of Peryite be with you.
Yes. Were I to simply lay down and die, it would not please Malacath.
You and I have work to do. The Silver Hand will tremble at our sight.
You can catch me at the Blue Palace later, if you want to talk again.
You can easily break a blade on the metal skin of a Dwemer construct.
You dare approach me here? Are you mad? You cannot hope to defeat me!
You did this city a great service by catching that killer. Well done.
You ever have to farm land while there was a battle going on? I have.
You got what you came for, didn't you? Go then, back to your college.
You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Brother.
You have the honor of addressing a member of the Thalmor. Bask in it.
You just trust in Astrid, follow her orders, and you'll do fine here.
You mean... you don't mean to say you haven't heard of Alduin's Wall?
You should look into joining. They could use every hand they can get.
You should talk to the Jarl up in Dragonsreach, lend any aid you can.
You should think about staying the night. Corpulus keeps a clean inn.
You shouldn't leave Solitude without trying our fish. Best in Skyrim.
You think you're finished? I've got plenty more where that came from.
You want to stay here, fine. But the rest of us aren't giving up now.
You wouldn't do that, would you? You wouldn't leave me here with her!
You'll need a little more coin than what you're floatin' around with.
You'll want to talk to Legate Rikke. She deals with the new recruits.
You're a good man, Maramal. We're lucky to have you watching over us.
You're here to blacken the Empire's name, and I won't be party to it.
You're losing a lot of blood. Maybe you should sit down for a moment.
You're really going to the Blue Palace? That presents an opportunity.
You're right, I forget myself. I've lived without hope for so long...
You're right. This is all my fault. Should we turn around, head back?
You've come far, mortal. No doubt you seek to enter Potema's Sanctum.
You've earned the right. Your strength and honor are apparent to all.
You've proven your strength, warrior. Let's avoid any more bloodshed.
Your actions here were a disgrace. You betrayed Skyrim at every turn.
Zu'u Odahviing. Call me when you have need, and I will come if I can.
...oh if I chance to see a cat, I'll feed its corpse to my pet rat... 
A group of werewolf hunters who have gotten wise to our little secret.
A lofty goal, to be sure. And what brings your search to our doorstep?
After Whiterun is retaken, Ulfric will pay in blood for his insolence.
Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Good to see you made it up here.
Ah, hello my Argonian friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?
Ah, now here is an item out of legend. This is Ysgramor's Soup Spoon. 
Ain't got one. But I'd fancy a chance at that Jaree-Ra's scrawny neck.
Alduin... we heard the Dragonrend Shout from here... you defeated him?
All right, but if you change your mind. Not like we're going anywhere.
All right. Fists only. And none of that magic stuff, either. Let's go!
And so ends the Dark Brotherhood, once and for all. About bloody time.
Another job well done. Your payment is secure, and you have my thanks.
Anyone seen entering or leaving? Any strange lights or unusual noises?
Are you going to help me with my mission? I need someone very capable.
Astrid did the right thing, and now it's your turn. End her suffering.
Azura is watching over you. She has seen this before it ever happened.
Be careful on the way to Solitude. Damn Stormcloaks could be anywhere.
Be careful. I miss my amulet, but a life cannot be replaced as easily.
Been on the river since I could walk. Wouldn't trade it for the world.
Best put your other tasks aside. The real challenge is about to begin.
Bold words, but true. Fine, you win. I'll pay the Argonians more coin.
Brynjolf's looking for you. Something about becoming the Guild Master.
But I can't leave here! I'm supposed to watch his house. What do I do?
But it must be something you're doing. There's no other explanation...
But, you took care of him and the giants. Two problems solved at once.
But... J'zargo is pleased to see that you are here, and not in pieces!
By the gods, let this mine be small so we can be done with it quickly.
By the gods. You... you're alive! But I had heard... your Sanctuary...
Careful. You spill one drop of silver, I'm taking it out of your hide.
Come on, Irileth, tell us, do you believe in this Dragonborn business?
Damn right. You don't have to be a Nord to fight for Skyrim's freedom.
Did we have an appointment? No... it was a delivery? I can't remember.
Don't let my uncle go on about his theories. You'll be here all night.
Don't you see? I prayed to the Night Mother! I am the Black Sacrament.
Enough of your dire predictions! We will talk about this another time.
Even Tullius may be forced to talk sense in the face of such a threat.
Everything's for sale, my friend! You need visit no other shops today!
Excuse me. You misplaced this, I believe? There you go. Take care now.
First it was 6 months, then a year, then 2 years. Now I'm in for life.
Food, experience and a roof over my head in the finest city in Skyrim.
For a dragon to attack Kynesgrove... Why? Why there? Is no place safe?
Found this among the dead. Something tells me I should give it to you.
Gah! This staff is useless... I'm useless. The whole world is useless!
Gladly. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Brother to the Orcs.
Good luck in Solitude. Keep Gulum-Ei alive, but remind him who we are.
Good, good. Just point me in the right direction and I'll do the rest.
Have you ever heard of a Shout that can knock a dragon out of the sky?
Have you met Lucky? He's my pet goat, and he helps me patrol the town.
Haven't you seen how my aunts act with my father? It's beyond strange.
He grows more powerful with every soldier slain in your pointless war!
Hear my Thu'um! Feel it in your bones. Match it, if you are Dovahkiin!
Help take this down, will you? We're throwing everything we can at it.
Hey, Argonian. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, could you deliver this bottle of Nightshade Extract to Wuunferth?
Hey, dark elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, high elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, I told you not to ask any questions. Now, here. For your trouble.
Hey, Redguard. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, wood elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hind siiv Alduin, hmm? No doubt you want to know where to find Alduin?
Hjorunn, the last time you tried anything, your fist broke on my head!
Horik and I have lived here ever since I retired. He's a good soldier.
How do we know she's not spying for the Battle-Born? This was foolish!
How rude! Can't be bothered to host an old friend for a decade or two.
However, I must insist that my laboratory remains strictly off limits.
Hroggar's house fire? Aye. He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
I appreciate the gesture, but I'd rather not be in debt to a stranger.
I believe I'll stay here and bask in Eldergleam's warmth a bit longer.
I came here from the Imperial Province, to work with my brother Lucan.
I can't do this all on my own. Are you... are you offering to help me?
I can't stand this city. It's impossible to make a decent living here.
I didn't lose a lover, Viola, I lost my wife. It's not the same thing.
I didn't mean nothing by it! Just... leave me alone! What do you want?
I don't even want to know, do I? But for you... all right. I'll do it.
I don't know, father... There's a whole world out there I want to see.
I don't recognize you, but I sense that you're one of us. Who are you?
I dunno, Drahff. They'd skin us alive if they knew we were doin' this.
I go where my brother goes. I think he wants to look around some more.
I grow tired of counting coin all day. Put steel in my hand, not gold.
I had a bad fall in the mine when I was bringing some food to the men.
I had once heard Skjor and Kodlak talking about the Totems of Hircine.
I have enough to keep me busy. View it as a chance to hone your craft.
I hope you're Dragonborn, I really do. But we'll find out soon enough.
I hope your parents are proud of you. They have a lot of reason to be.
I just wanted to get a better look at you. I like what I see, my dear.
I know you... everyone's been talking about it. What are you here for?
I left Winterhold for some time, and returned to stay here at the inn.
I may be new around here, but at least I know how to follow the rules.
I see that you have already begun to learn the Whirlwind Sprint Shout.
I shouldn't be. Everyone wants to ask me about mama and uncle Roggvir.
I still say you should take them all out like you did Deadking Torygg.
I suggest you put away your weapon. Wouldn't want to cause a... scene.
I suppose if we do, we will find out just how fast each of us can run.
I suppose the Jarl won't mind if I'm gone for a little while. Lead on.
I suppose the warmth in this place comes from all the hot steam vents.
I tried to fence some goods to Tonilia, and you know what she told me?
I would hate to think what would happen if this fell into enemy hands.
I'd go down there myself, but that would leave Jarl Laila unprotected.
I'll bend Kleppr's ear if there's anything wrong with a room you rent.
I'll stay here and guard the shipment. You get back to camp with news.
I'm a little busy at the moment. I've got all sorts of errands to run.
I'm afraid so. There's a problem with one of the Jarls here in Skyrim.
I'm certain Maven wishes you to be in Whiterun, not wasting time here.
I'm grateful, Skaggi. I'm sorry my daughter gives you so much trouble.
I'm here to ensure that General Tullius does not exceed his authority.
I'm not that foolish. The last thing I want is a war with your people.
I'm sorry. I don't know anymore. I'm just visiting here from Cyrodiil.
I'm telling you, Vulwulf, it's the investment you've been waiting for.
I'm too busy tending to the dead to spend my time making more of them.
I've never met someone like him that revels so much in other's misery.
If my friends find out you've been bothering me, you'll be very sorry!
If not... Then call me Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. Charmed.
If only more people would read this, things might be better in Riften.
If that weapon breaks anything of mine, I'll break something of yours.
If that's true, then we have much more to fear than the Thieves Guild.
If we do not please you, give us a sign so that we may understand why.
If you are here to purchase, I have many spells available. Do come in.
If you have a moment, I've come up with a few ideas I wanted to share.
If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift.
If you want to get into Riften, use the North Gate. This one's closed.
If you're getting involved in this, that'd be where you start looking.
If you're looking for a handout, you'll want to speak with my husband.
Ildene has been working in the Treasury House since before I was born.
Is that so? You ought to join the Stormcloaks, if you haven't already.
Isn't my son Hreinn such a good worker? Not like his father at all....
It has languished too long outside the winds of alliance and betrayal.
It wasn't long before we lost what we depend on to survive... respect.
It wasn't my fault! I told them over and over that it was an accident!
It's difficult sometimes... To know whether what I see is real or not.
It's Falion. He... He did it. I don't know what it was, but he did it.
It's most unfortunate that we need to have this discussion once again.
It's not as bad as before, but I still can't get a good night's sleep.
It's strange holding a hilt that isn't connected to a dagger. Oh well.
Just got here from the Summerset Isles. Lots of opportunity in Skyrim.
Keep a sharp eye about you and maybe I'll teach you to fight some day.
Keep moving, stay focused on your goal, and you will reach the summit.
Keep my men in your prayers. They'll need them if they don't shape up.
Keep on your guard. This city can be a little rough for those such us.
Last few years have been pretty bad. I've almost closed this place up.
Let's not jump to conclusions, soldier. The Legion always finds a way.
Like I said, the guard is down by the road. You really can't miss him.
Look, Ambarys, I just came here for a drink. I don't need any trouble.
Look, I already said Shadr doesn't owe me a thing, so get off my back.
Mara be praised! There is a way past the barrier to the inner sanctum.
Maven! So good to see you again. Hoist a flagon and celebrate with me!
Maybe I'm just getting soft in my old age, but I actually believe you.
My lord Jarl, if we do not take steps soon, our coffers will be empty.
My sister Deeja and I are treasure hunters. We like to collect things.
My wife trusts you, and I trust her judgment. So you can't be all bad.
Never. This is the best the Guild's done since I've been a part of it.
No offense intended, but I don't think we have anything to talk about.
No offense, I mean I'm sure you aren't into any of that kind of stuff.
No, don't bother. You're useless, as always. I'll get Ildene to do it.
No, how did you find me? Just give me more time, I can pay Maven back!
Not many Nords would work for a Reachman, but Ainethach is a good man.
Now you see why I've warned you against them! Bloodthirsty barbarians!
Now, Sergius knows what I want. I'm hoping he can get it done quickly.
Of course not. Purely a formality. Now, I need to see your invitation.
Of course, Jarl Balgruuf. You seem to have found me an able assistant.
Oh come now, what's a dragon or two compared to a day full of fishing!
Oh my. Elgrim, it's on the shelf to the right of the table, as always.
Oh, it's you. I was wondering why I was smelling something unpleasant.
Oh, this was back in the days of Olaf One-Eye, thousands of years ago.
Oh, very well. I can see there's no changing your stubborn Nord minds.
Old habits don't die easily, and we Nords can be as stubborn as stone.
One day, the Forsworn will paint the walls of Markarth in their blood.
One of those icebrains who wanders the land getting people's hopes up.
Our fires are visible for miles. We're in a low valley. Sitting ducks.
Panic we can handle, Balgruuf. It's the dragons I'm not so sure about.
Papa used to say I was greg-gare-ree-yus, just like him. I miss him...
Peace and prosperity are all the good folk of Rorikstead want in life.
People won't say it, but they're afraid of me, so they leave me alone.
Remember to tell that bastard I never want to see his ugly face again!
Sadly, no. My work affords me few opportunities for such an adventure.
See? She agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?
Seeing a good tavern brawl might be just the thing to lift my spirits.
Served me a drink just a few nights ago... but I can't say I knew her.
She hasn't had a chance to look at it yet. Just be careful over there.
Shor's high seat stands empty; his mien is too bright for mortal eyes.
Should I be holding the blade further away than I would a smaller one?
Should our paths cross again, I will remember your kindness. Farewell.
Since you put it that way, I think we can overlook your crime for now.
Skyrim being sold to the Thalmor so the Emperor could keep his throne!
So don't concern yourself with it. Markarth is safe. You have my word.
So why did he sell this place? I mean look at it. This is how to live.
Sometimes I hear Yngvar singing in his room. He's actually quite good.
Sometimes I miss the Legion, back when the Empire stood up for Skyrim.
Sometimes I'm not certain that the people of Riften want to be helped.
Speak if you must, but mind your tongue. I do not suffer fools gladly.
Surely you wouldn't miss a few scales... or a small amount of blood...
Take extra care you don't hit your head on a low-hanging bit of stone.
Taking it was the only way I could be sure this wasn't a Thalmor trap.
Thank you, Vex. You've always been the most reliable one in the Guild.
Thanks for the help. The Reach has been crawling with Forsworn lately.
That I am. Train the recruits. Turn boys into men. That sort of thing.
That pitiful ceremony behind the hall does not befit warriors like us.
That's a dwarven city. I hear they built armor that walks like people.
That's right. College of Winterhold, just north of town. Hard to miss.
The Aldmeri Dominion is the only thing keeping the Empire on its feet.
The Battle-Borns. The Emperor's biggest boot-lickers here in Whiterun.
The Blades knew, once upon a time. Alduin's Wall is the key. Yes, yes!
The dead should be made to serve the living, not the other way around!
The sooner this war ends, the sooner we can all get on with our lives.
The summoning of undead is even less advisable outside of the College.
The warehouse is off-limits. I suggest you head back the way you came.
The word is that Mercer Frey is a dead man. The Guild wants his blood.
Then I would be glad to help you with your mad dragon-trapping scheme.
There are always good reasons to fight. I just wish this war had them.
There's a small skeever den just east of the city, at Reachwater Rock.
There's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit in troubled times.
These walking devices are strange yet amazing. What magic powers them?
They are good women. They love me. You will speak no more ill of them.
They don't have to be perfect. Just send them over when they're ready.
They're good company if you want to study necromancy in peace, though.
Things are easier now that I don't have to worry about Ranmir anymore.
Think you can go blade to blade with me? You'd be dead in six seconds.
This is life, brother. The struggle is what reminds us to draw breath.
This is not where Teeba-Ei was meant to live out the rest of his days.
This is the first time I've set foot in Windhelm. What a dreary place.
This is your initiation into the coven. Go ahead. Have the first bite.
This isn't the time or place for magic, or whatever it is Falion does.
This kind of work suits you... and is going to end up makin' you rich.
To bring Ulfric his rightful glory, I would hammer a thousand shields.
Too few remember to honor the god of the dead. Do not be one of those.
Ungrien! I just found another spoiled keg! What's the matter with you?
Unless it's about the mill, I don't have time to talk. Too much to do.
Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds.
Use both Fus and Ro. Together, they will make the Shout more powerful.
Use your Unrelenting Force shout to strike the targets as they appear.
Vampires... an unclean lot. It will be a pleasure to clear this place.
Very good. Be sure to bring any more Sleeping Tree Sap you find to me.
Very true! Hmm. I wonder... do you know the Jarl's palace in Whiterun?
Very well, you may approach the Mournful Throne, but watch your words.
Very well. I suppose there's nothing wrong with a bit of harmless fun.
Want me to prove it? I bet a hundred gold I can take you, bare-handed.
We are creatures of the desert. The north wind chills us to the bones.
We can't trust anyone! Who knows what they'll do if they find me here.
We found a cave under the lake. With luck, it'll lead into the prison.
We have been on our own for some time now. I fear we will not survive.
We must go, quickly now. Take me to Delphine. We have much to discuss.
We should be honoring Kodlak, no matter our own thoughts on the blood.
We used to think the pirates had an army of battlemages at their side.
We want control of Markarth. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.
We will perform your next trial in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.
We've got our hands full dealing with the Stormcloaks. What about you?
Well now that's an odd question. Why in the world would you be asking?
Well then, I think  a pinch of frost salts should do the trick, right?
Well, I see that my time is up. Come back tomorrow if you wish to buy.
Well... By rights, she had a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim.
Were you certain in your purpose, you would have no need to apologize.
What am I supposed to do? Never leave the house? You want that, Endon?
What kind of question is that? Look at me! Is this a young man's face?
What kind of weapon do you prefer? I like the smaller, quicker blades.
What? No. Thonar Silver-Blood owns it. He owns everything in Markarth.
What...! Do you know who I am? I should have you taken up and flogged!
What's a milk drinker like you doing out here? Go home to your mother.
What's more, he's got no armor. I'll have to save up the money for it.
When I was young, our leaders became obsessed with the Thalmor threat.
Where else would I go? Dawnstar is my home and working here is my job.
Who are you to say what I should do? I'll pay her back when I'm ready.
Who? You mean that woman who was attacked in the market the other day?
Why are you still standing around here? Go get me the Phial, you fool.
Wouldn't surprise me if they were in league with the pirates, somehow.
Wuuthrad was the blade held by Ysgramor when he came back from Atmora.
Yes, I was hired to protect the others as we walk the roads of Skyrim.
Yes, of course. This war is causing your woes, it's hardly your fault.
Yes, yes, go. Leave me to my ceaseless responsibilities and burdens...
You better have coin to pay for your drinks. There's no handouts here.
You even think of taking something from my house... and I'll kill you.
You have no choice. You must complete your contract. You must kill me.
You keep talking like you're sure we'll find something useful in here.
You make an example of that gang, I'll give you a year's worth of pay.
You should probably be in bed. You're looking a bit under the weather.
You should see my forge-wife, Shuftharz, if you need weapons or armor.
You show promise. Remain focused, and you will fulfill your potential.
You stop that! I will not be violated by some... half-Septim magician!
You'll do all right some day. Today you need to keep training, though.
You're a long way from the Imperial City. What're you doing in Skyrim?
You're being paranoid. We're in control of Markarth. Not the Forsworn.
You're joking, right? Those bone-walkers will tear you limb from limb.
You're looking a little rough around the edges. You feeling all right?
You're not planning on hurting anyone with that weapon there, are you?
You're wearing Mara's amulet? You? I'd marry you. I'd marry you twice.
You've been working hard lately. You'll make a fine innkeeper someday.
You've found the vessels. I worried that I had sent you to your death.
Your hearts are full of grief, and my own weeps at the loss of Skjor. 
Your skin's as pale as the snow. You scared of sunlight, or something?
...and if I spy a singing bird, I'll snap its neck before it's heard...
'Course not. Dogs I could train. But a half-starved wolf? Not a chance.
[QUOTE]...for it bears aloft next summer's seeds.[QUOTE] That's my boy.
[QUOTE]An elf that studies stars[QUOTE]? Where did you hear about that?
A few months ago it was troll fat salve and now he's got something new.
A good bunch of men and women, who make too much a mess, if you ask me.
A man opens a gate and they cut his head off? Doesn't seem right to me.
After all you've put that man through. You should be more loyal to him.
All you ever do is complain about what you want. You're a spoiled baby.
And I've got better things to do than listen to more of your fantasies.
And in the future, I'd suggest you refrain from disappointing me again.
And so we meet again. But this time I know who and what you really are.
And they call me a savage. Least I don't leave my trash lying around...
Are my men now giving free reign to anyone who wanders into the castle?
Are you kidding? I've wanted to be with them since I was a little girl.
Are you kidding? Those damn things will drive me right out of business!
As you wish. Whatever you can afford will certainly be put to good use.
Bah! Save your magic. A warrior should face her foe, not hide from him.
Bandits know nothing of pity or mercy. No need to show them any either.
Be a lot safer just to have the Jarl's wizard teach you a thing or two.
Be careful, Mjoll. The Thieves Guild has Maven Black-Briar at her back.
Because the so-called Emperor is a coward! That's right, I said coward!
Before the Great War, the Blades helped the Empire against the Thalmor.
Before the Nords came, we worshipped the old gods, had our own kingdom.
Braith. I.... I've come to tell you that I'm not afraid of you anymore.
Brother! Mara's mercy, you're safe! Your friend told me about Helgen...
But he hasn't reported in yet, so he can't exactly confirm your story. 
But that battle isn't expected until tomorrow... Ruki, what's going on?
But the Empire will accept them, until the dragon menace is dealt with.
Clearly you have no idea who I am you or you wouldn't dare approach me.
Come talk to me after dark, we'll get the festival started when you do.
Cunning warriors and skilled workers. It's good to have you here, Lash.
Dawnstar's got its problems, but as long as the ore is good, I'll stay.
Did you ever want to return to your stronghold? Go back to your family?
Did you know Viola Giordano wanted to put one of them on my front door?
Didn't know her. Guards dragged her body away. Last we'll hear of that.
Divines preserve you, you're a hero. We'll re-open the Hall right away.
Do you think you might, err, have a moment to look at something for me?
Don't come any closer. I don't want Kynareth to think I'm on your side.
Dragons were never gone. They were just invisible and very, very quiet.
Elenwen always throws quite a party. I never miss one if I can help it.
Felldir speaks wisdom - the World-Eater, coward, fears you, Dragonborn.
Fine. Next time, save me the trouble and pass on it from the beginning.
Go on. See what she says. Now you've gone and gotten my hopes up again.
Gods willing, we'll find a chest full of gold in one of these chambers.
Going straight through or did you want to stop somewhere along the way?
Good luck out there. It seems like a tough time to be wandering Skyrim.
Good, Illdi. Soak in the lore. Jorn, what happened during the Red Year?
Good. But know that further dishonor to my family will mean your death.
Good. If Riften should fall, it's only right that its leader be spared.
Got a mark taxed with carryin' a heavy item. Care to lighten' the load?
Grew up here. Colder as Atmora, but that just grows the beards thicker!
Grew up in a stronghold. Every Orc girl tended the forge at some point.
Ha, nothing like fine spirits to help raise your... well, your spirits!
Hagraven up ahead. Pull the lever when you're ready and we'll take her.
Hah! And what would a witless oaf like you know about raising children?
Hail, brother! I saw you walking there and thought you might need this.
Have you seen those Briarheart men? That's some evil magic right there.
Have you tried the wine?  It's better than anything in the Blue Palace.
He has shown us that our suffering is not a punishment, but a blessing.
He introduced me to Gallus, and that was it. I've been here ever since.
He killed six Imperial Guards before they dragged him into the prisons.
He was here, but he left. If you leave now, you can probably catch him.
He's taking the Empire to task and making them answer for their crimes.
Heh, a Nord skull makes the best axe blade. 'bout all they're good for.
Her blessings are many. To love is to know the true nature of the gods.
Here is your reward for solving the murder, but I have another request.
Here's the deal. I can smuggle some equipment into the Embassy for you.
Hofgrir is a great teacher. I've learned so much about horses from him.
Hopefully Skaggi will send word to the Jarl and something will be done.
How dare you take that kind of tone. You're in service to me, remember?
I always preferred the liver myself. My brother had such a juicy liver.
I appreciate everything you've done for us, but I really am quite busy.
I don't know how ya' talked Maven into letting me go, and I don't care.
I don't think anyone here truly understands how useful my work will be.
I don't think he likes either Ulfric or Elisif much. Who can blame him?
I feel like any moment, a draugr is going to come and chop my head off.
I figure the guards could always use some help, so I keep my eyes open.
I guess you know what you're doing. I've got to find a way out of here.
I had retained Enthir's services in, uhh, acquiring something specific.
I hate it here. Grelod the Kind is the meanest person in all of Skyrim.
I have all sorts of interesting items for sale. Have you looked around?
I have some preparations of my own to make. I'll meet you at the stone.
I just wonder what her real motivations are. That woman is inscrutable.
I knew when you walked into the Hall of the Dead that you were special.
I know your family's honor is important to you, but we can't afford it!
I look forward to having it back soon. The sooner, the better, in fact.
I never would have believed it, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes...
I suppose someone else will need to look after the Apprentices for now.
I tell you? Saw that wild mare again yesterday, just outside the walls.
I trust you're not planning any trouble. What can I do for you, friend?
I understand, you're an important person. I'll catch up with you later.
I undertstand. Now, let me take a good look at this. Over here, please.
I used to be an adventurer in my day, then I settled down. Got married.
I want to help you, Dragonborn. And I will. But I need your help first.
I want you to know I don't trust you, Madena. And I'll be watching you.
I wonder how many of us think we'll be the lucky ones and survive this?
I... see. And is this something I'll need to worry about in the future?
I'll already told that buffoon I'm not paying you people a single coin!
I'll bet my last septim that there's a mechanism around here somewhere.
I'll die before elves dictate the fates of men. Are we not one in this?
I'll fight the entire Legion myself if they dare show their faces here.
I'll have to make a point of re-reading it. I don't recall the details.
I'll provide you wood and timber to make whatever riggings you'll need.
I'll speak with Farkas about how you handled yourself. Come back later.
I'm good at what I do, maybe even one of the best. But it's all I know.
I'm not paying you or Brynjolf a single coin! Now get out of my tavern!
I'm not really sure. Styrr thinks you have some sort of link to Potema.
I'm not so sure the few guards they've assigned to the farm are enough.
I'm not sure. None of them were working on anything terribly dangerous.
I'm not too proud to admit that I need a bit of help from time to time.
I'm sorry. My mind was just somewhere else. Did you need a room? Drink?
I'm still trying to figure out why Skjor let you in in the first place.
I've heard stanger things, are eaten over at the Temple of the Divines.
If I see him, I'll make sure he doesn't do anything brash. Don't worry.
If the damn Blades are no match for the Thalmor, what chance do I have?
If the forest wasn't so dangerous, I'd spend every spare moment riding.
If those rebels think they can best us, they have another think coming.
If we want to stay on top in Skyrim, the Guild needs that paragon back.
If you can bring me these materials, the Phial can again be made whole.
If you don't mind me saying, Leigelf. You're working too hard. Go home.
If you ever settle down to have children, think twice before you do it.
If you want answers, ask at the inn. She told me she was staying there.
If you're not doing something you enjoy, then you're wasting your life.
If you've got the coin, you've come to the right place. Pull up a seat.
Impressive. Your Thu'um is precise. You show great promise, Dragonborn.
In the manner of dreams, I cannot escape. I'm forced to wait and watch.
Is it true that you refused to sell one of your... trinkets to Hemming?
It can't be lost. It just can't! It's irreplaceable, do you understand?
It's been a while now. I miss him, but it's clear he's not coming back.
It's not that you're intruding. I'd wager they've actually expected us.
J'zargo regrets that there was no chance to speak with the Psijic Monk.
Just a servant of Skald the Elder. Not worthy of time or consideration.
Just glad all that business with Malyn is over with. What did you need?
Just head north - you can't miss it. It's the capital of Whiterun Hold.
Kematu always says we're supposed to be the best of the best. I wasn't.
Kill him. Take your rightful place as my champion, or I will crush you.
Let's go. I'd rather not stay out here alone any longer than I have to.
Lob will one day take my place, and bring honor to our tribe as I have.
Look, that's all I know. I never promised you I'd have all the answers.
Look, we all have our flaws; mine is that women can't get enough of me.
Lucky then they left behind their own way of reading the Elder Scrolls.
Make it quick, then. I don't want your stink driving my customers away.
Make your choice. Make your kill. I just want to observe... and admire.
Maybe they're afraid of you. Maybe it's your breath. How should I know?
Mine? Oh no, the stone is yours. I simply need to borrow it a moment...
Morthal doesn't need any trouble. You keep your nose clean, understand?
Morthal is a troubled place, and it is my duty to see it rest in peace.
Most of my customers are locals, come to relax after a hard day's toil.
Mother, what's the meaning of this? Who have you brought into our home?
My duty is to keep the Jarl safe. Not play nursemaid to you sycophants.
My men are fearless. It's the Imperial milk drinkers I'm worried about.
My mother, Sharamph, knows many remedies you may wish to take with you.
Need some sort of toxin for a special occasion? That's where I come in.
No need to get hasty. I... I was just testing you. You can go on ahead.
No one has seen or heard from them in over a hundred years now, though.
No! I'm saving myself for someone special. Someone who loves me dearly.
Not really. Varnius Junius is a fool. I'm sure nothing will come of it.
Nothing, nothing at all! Arniel already overpaid for... whatever it is.
Now we need to prepare a grand feast to welcome you to Namira's coven. 
Now you're coming with us. It's a life sentence in Cidhna Mine for you.
Now, are you ready to try again? I am confident it will work this time.
Now, come with me, child. We'll prepare you for the goddess's presence.
Now, I believe you have some business to conclude with my court wizard?
Now, I need your assistance with a matter of a more... personal nature.
Of course! I'd be more than happy to add a donation to our charity box.
Of course... I could fly you there. But not while imprisoned like this.
Oh dear, I didn't mean to say it like that. That wasn't a joke, really.
Oh, I... I'm sorry. I just can't... you'll have to speak to my husband.
Oh, what a kind and wise wizard you are. Sure to earn our Lady's favor.
Once again, your suspension is lifted. Please try and control yourself.
Once I have the sigil stone, I shall inscribe the spells that you seek.
Only way this guilds going to continue to grow is by takin' extra work.
Please. Remove your naked obscenity from the company of civilized folk.
Pruzah wundunne wah Wuth Gein. I wish the old one luck in his... quest.
sharp intake of breath -- surprise and amazement -- [QUOTE]wha??[QUOTE]
She hides inside with her 'visions'. We need a leader, not some mystic!
Shor's power protects this hall; but beyond is fear, brought by Alduin.
Since Adrianne's death, I've had to buy them from the Khajiit caravans.
Since then, they've been working to weaken the Empire any way they can.
Skuli's father is off fighting for the Empire. I'm sure he's just fine.
So Alva did it to get Hroggar for herself? I should have suspected her.
So the Stormcloaks took the Reach? Maybe Talos really is on their side.
So you bought Vlindrel Hall, eh? Wish I could afford a house that nice.
So, you're finally back. Look, I've been patient, but you still owe me.
Sorry, I'm not buying any goods until you straighten this out with Vex.
Speak with Legate Rikke. She will determine if you are Legion material.
Speak. Khajiit will listen until all the sugars in the world turn sour.
Still here? What's the matter, can't handle what I'm throwing your way?
Succeed at this, and you'll be rewarded. Whiterun will be in your debt.
Suleyki mulaag, Paarthurnax. My power has waxed, while yours has waned.
Talk to Vex. She used to know him very well... if you catch my meaning.
Thank you. I don't know what's going on, but I think I owe you my life.
That armor... it's like nothing I've ever seen. Like forged midnight...
That's certainly an understatement. I've never seen anything like this!
That's right! My grandfather used to tell stories about the Dragonborn.
That's the first bit of good news I've had since I set sail a year ago.
That's what I thought. Now get out of my way, baby. I got things to do.
The artifacts I've discovered in Nchuand-Zel will make history one day.
The endless wait gives way to battle! Alduin's doom, his death or ours!
The Eyes would go a long way in helping get the Guild back on its feet.
The faster we take them out, the faster we can claim this city as ours!
The Forsworn have been spotted to the north, near Bruca's Leap Redoubt.
The General has sent me to obtain a powerful weapon for the war effort.
The roads of Skyrim can be treacherous. If you must walk them, be wary.
The Silver Hand. They finally found enough courage to attack Jorrvaskr.
The toes are my favorite part. I hope I get to take a few home with me.
The way this war is going there might not be anyone left to drink soon.
There are more books to be recovered and secured here in the Arcanaeum.
There the souls of the Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel.
There's been word of some trouble nearby. I'm on my way to investigate.
There's nothing for you in the warehouse, so why don't you take a walk?
They have always sought to turn the Dragonborn from the path of wisdom.
They may be able to tell you something about the Elder Scroll you seek.
They see me as master. Wuth. Onik. Old and wise. It is true I am old...
They're half-naked. That ain't right. Somebody's gotta say somethin'...
This Karliah must have spent a lot of time and resources planning this.
This warning is passed to you because the Psijic Order believes in you.
This world is not ready for it. If it remains here, it will be misused.
Those born with the Dragon Blood in 'em. Like old Tiber Septim himself.
Those were the days. I'd never seen my husband fight so bravely before.
Three weeks? You're mad! You can't keep the stand closed for that long!
True... But qostiid - prophecy - tells what may be, not what should be.
Tsk. You've uncovered my master plan. Now I suppose you'll never leave.
Wait. You're that new bard, the one who saved the Festival. Aren't you?
Wait... you mean you killed every last one of them? I can't believe it!
Walk in Gaius Maro's shadow, and deliver to him the judgment of Sithis.
War always comes down to this, doesn't it? A single truth-laden moment.
We all come into Arkay's light in the end, but there's no need to rush.
We can't afford to lose any men if we wish to keep Falkreath protected.
We face the world together now. Where should we live? My home is yours.
We need to find that burial mound before its dragon comes back to life.
We need to pass through the kitchen. Your gear is hidden in the larder.
We serve only the best here... Black-Briar Mead. May I get one for you?
We'll all meet Arkay sooner or later. Best to enjoy the time we've got.
We've got trouble right here in Whiterun Hold. Nothing we can't handle.
Welcome, child of Malacath. Your kin bid you welcome to our stronghold.
Well if my layabout manservant fed me more, that wouldn't be a problem.
Well, I'm [QUOTE]not a scholar[QUOTE] of architecture. And that's that.
Well, that's where I started. But it turned into something of a ballad.
What a foul and unnatural weapon you wield. Never have I seen its like.
What fragments we have are displayed in honor, but we always seek more.
What! What are you doing?! You fools! You cannot bind me to your wills!
What? Do you want to be that thing's next meal? Into the keep, already!
What'd you pick up there? Oh, I wish I saw that first. You're so lucky!
Whatever you need. By Ysmir, if it's simple and strong, I can forge it.
When the house is yours, return to me and I will present you the title.
While you were in the Star, Azura gave me a vision. Her last, she said.
Who comes, Malborn? You know I don't like strange smells in my kitchen.
Why do you care anyway? It's not like we're family. This is a business.
Why would you even come to Jorrvaskr without knowing what we stand for?
Will he acknowledge that we Nords deserve to determine our own future? 
With the Empire's help, Winterhold will be back on its feet in no time.
Work? I demand tribute before you can be considered for any real tasks.
Yes, you're very fond of saying that. You know I like hammers and axes.
You are new to Morthal. We have not spoken before. This is interesting.
You better be careful with that magic, if you know what's good for you.
You can see it from here, though. The mountain just over the buildings.
You come talking to me wearing Imperial armor? You got stew for brains?
You could challenge Burguk, my brother. Yours is the stronger swordarm.
You got Aldis to tell you something? I knew you would. What did he say?
You looking for a shield? Best thing between you and the enemy, friend.
You win. On my honor, Carlotta won't have to worry about me ever again.
You'll be all right on your own? Then I'll see you back at the College.
You'll get the rest of your money when we confirm his story. As agreed.
You're not from around here. I'll bet you're here to help with the war!
Your outfit is something of an open wound... where attire is concerned.
Your shield... Dwarf-make, is it not? But yet it seems so much... more.
Your words are cheap. Why should I speak to you after what you've done?
...might pay off my bounty this time... walk into the city a free man...
[QUOTE]Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor...[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]You are Ysmir now, the Dragon of the North, hearken to it.[QUOTE]
Ah, a visitor. Old Hroldan Inn has hundreds of years of history, friend.
Ah, but we can discuss that later, yeah? What does the Brotherhood need?
All right, so here you are. Looks like the others are eager to meet you.
An old storeroom. See if you can find some potions. Might come in handy.
Ancano is doing something with that thing... the Eye. We can't stop him!
And let's not forget her crew - loyal and bloodthirsty, the lot of them.
And when he stands in Namira's presence, she will take care of the rest.
Anyway, you know the drill. You want to buy back in, and it'll cost you.
Are the Arch-Mage's robes as comfortable as J'zargo believes them to be?
Are you kidding? I came all the way from Cyrodiil just to work with him.
As our voices summon you the blood of the innocent binds you Wolf Queen!
Ask Esbern. If he doesn't know himself, he'll know where to find it out.
Been so long since I killed a Stormcloak, my sword arm's getting flabby.
Bits and baubles for sale, all crafted by the best blacksmith in Skyrim.
Brynjolf told me he was looking for you about the Guild Master ceremony.
Burguk is a fine chief. He brings strength and wealth to the stronghold.
But I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis. It cannot be known to me.
But until that dragon's dealt with, Ulfric's just going to have to wait.
By Ysmir, I will. Gods know it's been too long since I tasted real meat.
Calm down there, friend. I'll pay! Tell Haran that she'll have her gold.
Can't say I'm surprised with the way things have been going around here.
Changed your mind? Decided you want to soldier for the Empire after all?
Come on, you outsiders always have plenty of gold on you. Spare a piece!
Come to purchase ebony? Our Gloombound Mine runs thick with black veins.
Come with me. It is time for us to recognize you formally as Dragonborn.
Cookware, knives and other goods for the home, all at reasonable prices!
Cross the river and then head north. You'll see it, just past the falls.
Disrupt my Arcanaeum, and I will have you torn apart by angry Atronachs.
Do colors seem brighter to you? Everything seems bigger, too. Strange...
Do not interrupt the ritual. Go empty the vessels and sit on the throne.
Do this task for me and you'll be well on your way to a title in Riften.
Dock work is not good work. Better than Black Marsh though. Much better.
Don't be so sure. Now, have you finished grinding the dried snowberries?
Don't make trouble or else I'll ask Dirge to [QUOTE]walk[QUOTE] you out.
Either this is some kind of a joke, or you're keeping something from me.
Elewen's parties are always so elegant. She really has impeccable taste.
Especially for a new whelp, you should choose your words more carefully.
Everything was going great in Redbelly. Then the damn spiders showed up.
Fight well, don't be a lout, and you'll be fine. You don't need my help.
Fighting draugr is as much about controlling your fear as anything else.
Fine then.  The blood of my family is on your hands as well as Brurid's.
For your sake, I hope your took that armor from a dead Imperial scout...
Frabbi, my dear loving wife, could you please clean out our guest rooms?
Fresh food. No wood rot on the furniture. Someone's been here. Recently.
Get the damn Key and let's get out of here before we end up like Mercer!
Get there in one piece and we'll see if you've really got what it takes.
Give me your sword, Hjalti. That we may become brothers as you promised.
Glad to see you finally came to to your senses. Ready to make some coin?
Goldenglow Estate is critically important to one of our largest clients.
Good to see Skyrim still has such fine people. You give an old man hope.
Good. The two of us then. All of Skyrim should get ready to stand aside.
Got all your gold ready, boss. You can count every coin, it's all there.
Got to thinking, maybe I'm the Dragonborn, and I just don't know it yet.
Grelka, have you had anyone come by and try to sell you an iron war axe?
Ha ha ha ha! Yeah, I sure did. It was one of my best pranks yet, father.
Ha! I knew it, you rascal! By Sithis, the old man was worth the trouble.
He will not resist the challenge of your Voice, Dovahkiin. He will come.
Head up the steps from the market an' look to your right. Can't miss it.
Hear my prayer, son of Akatosh, and grant peace to these departed souls.
Here, take this gift as a sign of the Empire's appreciation, and my own.
Here, use my sword to do it. I made sure to sharpen it for the occasion.
Hmm, yes. I have been pondering on exactly that question. Lingrah morah.
How can you say that? This mine was filled with draugr not too long ago.
How old is my daughter now, I wonder? In prison, you lose track of time.
Husband, you worry far too much. We are within an hour's walk of Riften.
I assure you that I shall be watching you -- all of you -- very closely.
I believe she's trying to look as ravishing as possible for you, milord.
I can hear water rushing through these pipes. We must be beneath a lake.
I can't imagine where he found the gold to take it to market so quickly.
I can't lose all my research. There has to be a way to save the College.
I can't stop you if that's what you want to do. Hircine is too powerful.
I couldn't let her run off to that pretender Eorlund Gray-Mane, could I?
I did. Strange days when the monks will do that. I wonder what it means.
I don't know who you've been talking to, but they were clearly mistaken.
I don't, I'm afraid. Ranmir didn't talk much about her after she'd left.
I expect to be informed if they make any future attempts to contact you.
I expected too much. I'll seek someone else to salvage the family honor.
I grant you this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
I have a very close relationship with Savos Aren, the current Arch-Mage.
I have one. A nephew. He's in prison for being a member of the Forsworn.
I have so very many ways to deal with people. Very few of them pleasant.
I hope you're looking at me like that because you want to buy something?
I just can't believe that Ulfric is gone. Skyrim will never be free now.
I just want to learn, I don't want to think about what's expected of me.
I just wanted to give you a proper thank you for everything you've done.
I knew I could count on Irileth. But there must be more to it than that.
I long to be out there, with my brothers, waging war against the Empire.
I long to fight that foul worm, but by Shor's command we curb our wrath.
I own Hollyfrost Farm outside the city. It's honest work, if a bit dull.
I should have known better than to expect you to give us a fair hearing.
I think we can all profit from the situation in which we find ourselves.
I think you'll be a superb addition to the College. Welcome, Apprentice.
I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee...
I want to be clean, like he was, and go to Sovngarde when I finally die.
I was wondering if you had ordered the shipment of that frostwheat, sir.
I wish the Nords, Argonians and dark elves in Windhelm got along better.
I'd travel more, but who wants to deal with all the soldiers these days?
I'll be needing you to mop the place down extra tonight. Lots of spills!
I'll talk with Jala, dear. I'm sure she'll accept a potato as repayment.
I'll try and hold them off as best I can. You get back to the Sanctuary!
I'm a sailor on the Northwind. We're laying over in Windhelm for awhile.
I'm betting bodies. Lots and lots of bodies. And maybe some valuables...
I'm bored. What do you say we go smash a few heads in? This one's on me.
I'm no fool, Mercer. Crossing blades with you would be a death sentence.
I'm relieved Brynjolf has an open mind or that could have gotten bloody.
I'm so sorry Miss Temba. Perhaps if you would have been more specific...
I've been a lot of things in my life. Pit fighter's the one I'm best at.
I've been fighting in the Pit for years. That should tell you something.
I've eaten more in the last two hours than I have in the last two weeks.
I've got my hands full with something. Don't go far. I'll need you soon.
I've made progress, but then hit a snag. I think perhaps you could help.
I've smoothed things over with her for now, but you can forget your cut.
I've told you everything I can. I don't know what else you could want...
If I find Mercer first, I'm going to crush his skull with my bare hands!
If it's horses you want, you'll want to speak to Hofgrir at the stables.
If she's to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must be struck.
If you lose, well, you'll know the freedom of Sovngarde if you're lucky.
If you love history, you're in the right place. Skyrim is steeped in it.
If you require assistance with summoning techniques, please let me know.
If you want to awaken from your next slumber, I suggest you leave me be.
If you want to fight your way out of here, you have to do it in the Pit.
If you're looking to purchase any mead, speak to the brewmaster, Mallus.
In exchange for Markarth, the source of most of Skyrim's silver? Hardly.
It 'may be' in danger? Take a look. I don't think there's much question.
It doesn't matter. I'm here. We're together now. And we will be forever.
It is done. The defiler is defeated. Take Dawnbreaker from its pedestal.
It is not the place of the College to become involved in local politics.
It'll take time to rebuild, but the Nords are no strangers to hard work.
It's a real pity about his wife and kid. The screams woke half the town.
It's a shame you got booted from the Guild... things were going so well.
It's damn near impossible to find anymore. You want to buy it off of me?
It's easy - stay inside the boundaries and only use the practice arrows.
It's in the Solitude Inlet - that's the channel just north of the docks.
It's late outlander. Come back in the morning if you need to spend coin.
It's not any of your bother, so I don't see what you're apologizing for.
It's not the most exciting answer but the most likely. I'll write it in.
Ivarstead? So close to Riften? She's an even bigger fool than I thought.
J'zargo is working hard, but cannot do it alone. Can you help with this?
Just as long as you don't breathe on me, Hjorunn. I'll be out for hours.
Keep a sharp eye out. There's no telling what we might run into in here.
Keep talking, little man, and we'll see who gets [QUOTE]punished.[QUOTE]
Keep your wits about you. The Jarl of Whiterun is known for his temper. 
Last I'd heard, he was crossing the border from Morrowind into The Rift.
Leifnarr said they'd pay double what you can usually get at the markets.
Let's go. We need to get to the Western Watchtower before it's too late.
Look at you. Wearing an Amulet of Mara. Are you saying you're available?
Look, I'm merely suggesting a few things that could expand our business.
Look, if you want arrows we have them, but don't insult my intelligence.
Lucky for you, I possess a forgiving nature and I'm not easily insulted.
Mama doesn't think I'm girlish enough. But that's just stupid girl talk.
Markarth lives because my family makes sure it's fed on gold and silver.
Maven! Always a pleasure to receive you. What can I help you with today?
May I just say, it's a pleasure to have you leading the College. Really.
More importantly, I'd like to know why he's asking for you specifically.
Most of our business comes from folks traveling to and from the College.
Most of the guards in Dawnstar carry swords forged from his very smithy.
My bones ache for the moonsugar. It has been too long since I tasted it.
My only concern is for the children. The poor darlings have no one else.
My shipmates scoff at my love of finery, but I know envy when I hear it.
My wife is a good woman, but every man needs a little variety, you know?
Need a room? Don't worry. Nightmares don't seem to happen for travelers.
Need you to deliver some false orders to the Imperial Legate in Morthal.
New in town, huh? Whiterun's got two clans, both old and both respected.
No higher fate than fall in battle at Sovngarde's gates, a glorious end!
No matter. Go to High Hrothgar. Learn what the Greybeards can teach you.
No signs of any dragon right now, but it sure looks like he's been here.
No time to talk. Snitch or double-cross me and I'll kill you. I mean it!
No, mother. It's no wonder our enemies fear the sight of an Orc warrior.
No. As if trade wasn't poor enough. Now there's violence in the streets.
Nobody allowed in. Ulfric Stormcloak's orders. Consider yourself warned.
Not really sure what to do with myself anymore. I just miss her so much.
Not sure I understand the question. The Legion's always been in Skyrim. 
Now, don't tell my husband, but I don't have any problem with Bassianus.
Now, I've been reading about the best ways to grow corn in permafrost...
Now, if I'm not mistaken. Legate Rikke has a special assignment for you.
Now, if were done being sentimental, it's time for you to take the Oath.
Oh, I have the utmost faith in your success, believe me. So let's begin.
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I bothering you? Am I making your life more difficult?
Oh, what is this? A visitor? To our farm? Oh, do stay for a while, dear.
Oh, yes. It's all been foretold. The end has begun. Alduin has returned.
Oh... hello there. Didn't notice you come up. I was focusing my magicka.
Once again Brynjolf sends me someone with no backbone, no determination.
Onmund made a deal. He made that choice, and now he has to live with it.
Orchendor promised a place where we would be accepted and taken care of.
Our tribe has survived this long without you interfering. We'll be fine.
Papa says I won't see Roggvir any more, but he wouldn't tell me why not.
Perhaps this is a matter best discussed with with the general in person.
Please! Don't take the statue! It's the only thing of value I have left!
Properly controlled, it has knowledge enough to turn paupers into kings.
Quickly now, or would you prefer I let Whiterun fall to the Stormcloaks?
Really? How did we afford that? Besides, I like the gown I already have.
Really? I'd be happy to show you a bit about herbs if you find the book.
Really? J'zargo was having such fun. Ah, well. Back to the College then.
REC - no subtitles displayed; noise of physical exertion while attacking
Revel in your victory here today, even as the gods revel in your honor! 
Said he found some old Dwemer artifact, but... well, that was years ago.
Sauranach mine is open again. How am I supposed to handle all this work?
Sides quickly formed behind these men and the Ratway became a bloodbath.
Skyrim will not bow to a false king any longer. Ulfric is the true king.
So is it true, bandits get... you know, real friendly with the wildlife?
So, Sapphire. Can I do anything for you, or more to the point... to you?
So... you spoke to Paarthurnax. The dragonblood burns bright within you.
Sometimes I wonder if Ulfric understands what I'm dealing with out here.
Sorry, but you'll have to find someone else to help you with your prank.
Sorry, lad... I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time.
Stay under cover. This is what we came for. We need to see what happens.
Steady, legionnaires! We've been through worse. Just keep your guard up!
Still? If I have to wait much longer, you may need to just bury me here.
Sure I might have some dirt in my past, but that's just ancient history.
Sure, fine. Thanks for nothing. You already got what you needed from me.
Surprised? I guess I'm getting pretty good at my harmless innkeeper act.
Thank you, traveler. Be safe and don't forget to keep an eye on the sky.
That Heimskr's crazy. Him and his talk o' Talos. Wish he'd just shut up.
That was good work. Deeja's in the hold of the ship. Go down two levels.
That's why I wanted the ring... it was said to give men like me control.
The Arcanaeum is always accepting new volumes. I'll take what I can get.
The finest skooma, the sweetest moon sugar. At a fair price, of course. 
The Gray Quarter's not much to look at now, but it wasn't always so bad.
The Hall of Valor, where heroes wait to follow Shor to the final battle.
The house I mentioned earlier is still available, if you want to buy it.
The Imperials think us all lawless beasts. I'm proof of their ignorance.
The men here like my attention, and I like theirs. Best know your place.
The only reason to do that would be to block pursuit. It must be Mercer.
The outside world means little to us, and we'd like it to stay that way.
The people saw fit to name me Jarl, and I don't intend to let them down.
The rest of you, prepare to journey to the Tomb of Ysgramor. For Kodlak.
The Silver Hand has been scouring the world for more pieces of Wuuthrad.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of the Pale. Congratulations.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. Congratulations.
Then I want you to head out there immediately and eliminate all of them.
There must be something about that amulet. Have you tried putting it on?
There's no time to stand on ceremony, my friend. I need your help again.
There's no time! You have to get back to the College as fast as you can!
There's so much to learn about the shop. I'll never get it all straight.
There's yet hope that our relationship with the College can be repaired.
They are counted upon every bit as much as Candlelight, or Invisibility.
They practically own the city of Markarth. And we're here on their coin.
Think you can intimidate me? In my own orphanage? Ha! Not bloody likely.
This bears closer inspection. I'd like to stay a while and examine this.
This is an ode to Skyrim's truest sons and daughters... the Stormcloaks.
This is better than sitting around talking about magic, don't you think?
This place, it's like a maze. How did the dwarves find their way around?
Those Forsworn were fierce fighters. Fiercer than I could have imagined.
To see through Magnus' Eye without being blinded, you require his staff.
Travelers have been coming to Whiterun. They tell stories about dragons.
Vahrukt unslaad... perhaps none but me now remember how he was defeated.
We also must make an effort to avoid worsening what Skyrim thinks of us.
We also perform wedding ceremonies for all the loving couples in Skyrim.
We aren't a big city like Solitude or Markarth, but we like it this way.
We could have turned back. It could have ended there. But we kept going.
We had the best of everything down here... the Ratway was a damn palace.
We mustn't tarry... the Skull needs to be destroyed as soon as possible.
We need to go upstairs, that's where she is! That's where the books are!
We won't kill you, outlander, but we don't want you here. Remember that.
We'd better push on. The rest of them will have to find another way out.
We've got some traders coming in, and are short on Snow Sabre Cat pelts.
We've got them pinned in! It's only a matter of time now. Keep fighting!
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle out in the Pale.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle up in Haafingar.
What a marvel of engineering. The ancient Nords were ingenious builders.
What are you waiting for? I know you want to kill me. Now's your chance!
What does this mean, to combine magic? Magic plus magic is still magic. 
What good is a sword or an axe against an enemy made of brass and steel?
What macabre mysteries would these tools reveal if they could but speak?
What makes you think I know anything? Everyone knows he's dead and gone!
When the Empire surrendered to the Aldmeri Dominion, they shamed us all!
Which is utterly useless at the moment. You need to fill it with a soul.
Why are you always acting like such a big baby? I've gotten us this far.
Why don't you grab yourself a drink at the Windpeak before heading back?
Will you be a hero whose name is remembered in song throughout the ages?
Wolves, trolls, mammoths and giants would all like to make a meal of us.
Women murdered time and again, and all the guards care about is the war.
Yeah? What do you want? If this is about the meadery, we can talk later.
Yes, that's right.  Look around you. Most of the lands you see are mine.
Yes, the World-Eater is gone... may the spirits have mercy on our souls.
You appear hesitant to don your Nightingale Armor. What's troubling you?
You aren't the first one to have gotten this far. You won't be the last.
You demand payment for protection and you can't even protect yourselves.
You don't have enough gold to pay it off, and I'm not cutting any deals.
You fighter types are always underfoot. You want me to clean? Then scat!
You have been a worthy tool. Fill the world with destruction in my name.
You have not answered my question. Why do you need to learn this Thu'um?
You have to let Fastred follow her heart. You can't tell her what to do.
You haven't been able to take it back yet. Why should we give it up now?
You keep on like you are, you'll end up with two daughters who hate you.
You know, a good Purification might be just what this Sanctuary needs...
You look like you could use a drink. What do you say to some cheap mead?
You mean the official sort of business? Hmm, well... no. No, not really.
You must find it! It cannot end this way! Not after I've worked so hard!
You should speak to my daughter, Evette. She's the brains of the family.
You should try that bit on the barkeep. Maybe get yourself a free drink.
You stand in High Hrothgar, on the slopes of Kynareth's sacred mountain.
You surprise me, Karliah. This offer is definitely weighted in my favor.
You think I don't know what you're up to? You think I can't destroy you?
You wear the armor of a brigand. Best not cause any trouble on my watch.
You? You are nothing. An empty vapor, dispersed by the slightest breeze.
You'll find my brother Solaf and I are the only true Nords in Falkreath.
You'll never see the sun again, you hear me? No one escapes Cidhna Mine.
You're asking for trouble walking around with dangerous magic like that.
You're not at all what I expected. I imagined you'd be fatter, honestly.
You're pretty, I'll give ya that. Just stay away from my husband, Alvor.
You're testing my patience, but very well. I'll give you another chance.
You've been a worthy patron. Shall I join you once more, free of charge?
You've been here long enough to know that Nords aren't always sensible. 
You've honored my father's memory in more ways than I have words to say.
...gonna start keepin' a knife in my boot... tired of gettin' disarmed...
...need to sharpen my blade... make it shiny, gleamy, and oh so deadly...
30th of Frostfall, 171. Thirty years ago. The Great War started that day.
A bit longer, yet. We need more money if we want to be chiefs of our own.
A method to your madness and your madness is the method and the melody...
A strange kind of ritual, but I won't mind killing those wretched things.
Absurd that you can't get good sweet rolls in this skeeverhole of a city.
After Brynjolf has installed you as Guild Master, we can speak at length.
Again? Are you sure? He still hasn't answered your last several requests.
Ah, but you look tired. Come, share a bottle of Honningbrew Mead with me!
Ah, Falion. Always looking where he shouldn't for things he doesn't need.
Ah, I can't reveal all my secrets to you. But rest assured, I would know.
Ah, sweet freedom. Now that's more like it. You have my thanks, stranger.
All right, Delvin. What gives with that case of Shadowbanish you sold me?
All right, I understand. I'll do it tomorrow, okay? Just get off my back.
All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical...
All right. I wrote down the last place I'd heard about. Don't get killed.
Allow me to present you with this compensation for your selfless efforts.
And the Underforge taps an ancient magic that is older than men or elves.
And when you are, we can try this again and I'll be sure to get it right.
And you know what? Despite what I left behind, I don't regret it one bit.
Another new student... I'm surprised at how many of you there are lately.
Are you all right, dear? I thought I saw a tear in your eye a moment ago.
Are you sure you can find your way? It would be easy to get lost in here.
As steward, I serve as an intermediary between the Jarl and her subjects.
As you may have learned, this object... The Eye... is immensely powerful.
At least, if you're gonna cause trouble, go somewhere else, okay? Please?
Be warned that once you've chosen, you can't reselect for at least a day.
Being in exile is the most humiliating thing I've experienced in my life.
Besides, you're not scared of a few sleeping metal men. Are you, Drennen?
Brigands I can handle, but this talk of dragons? World's gone mad, I say.
But enough talk. Come! Won't you share a drink with me and my companions?
But I forgive you for not knowing who I am. Few hear my whispers anymore.
But I see that spark in your eye and I know better than to warn you away.
But if you insist, I suppose I'll be on my way. Thank you, and good luck.
But none have yet stood against Alduin himself. Galthor, Sorri, Birkir...
But our work is just beginning. Approach me, Listener, and hear my words.
But the difficulty remains - how to lure a dragon to Dragonsreach at all?
But you're able to see the whole in the parts, and for that I'm grateful.
But, I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis. It cannot be known to me.
Can't believe anyone was dumb enough to mistake you for a Forsworn agent.
Careful of the molten metal. That gets on you, kiss your fingers goodbye.
Careful. They might put you away if you don't at least put on some pants.
cheerful laughter with a friend as you walk off to drink and swap stories
Comes the end of the day, Imperials and Stormcloaks ain't much different.
Congratulations. You've altered the fate of a Daedric artifact and lived.
Daar sul thur se Alduin vokrii. Today Alduin's lordship will be restored.
Dangerous post, Dawnstar. If the bandits don't get you, the animals will.
Dead. Something grabbed her from behind. Gone before I could do anything.
Derkeethus used to take me diving way down deep in the river. I miss him.
Did you happen to discover where the fetcher was getting his skooma from?
Did you think we'd accept a heartfelt apology and let bygones be bygones?
Do you think I could be a member of the Circle? Some day? If I work hard?
Don't want to know what you did and I don't care. Just keep away from me.
Don't worry, Orthus. I'm doing my best to get you reassigned to Solitude.
Dragons? Well, that's fascinating. We should have someone look into that.
Elgrim, honey. I'm concerned about your new pupil. She seems very... odd.
Eorlund, dearest, are you hungry? Would you like me to fix you something?
Evenaar bahlok. There are many hungers it is better to deny than to feed.
Every Orc learns the heavy labor of mining. All spend years in the caves.
Everyone is this city is so on edge. I could use some good news, Skulvar.
Everything you see here was made with skill and care by my wife Adrianne.
Faralda can teach Destruction spells, and offers training in that school.
From maid to Steward, I can hardly believe it. I hope I'm up to the task.
Gerdur's family first settled here as wood cutters a few generations ago.
Go to each focal point and remove whatever impurities you may find there.
Good. If you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Now get going.
Hail, friend! It's good to see another merry soul enjoying this fine day.
Have anything you wish to sell? I pay fair prices for all sorts of goods.
Have our scouts come up with any information on these reports of dragons?
He has joined the honored dead. This will be a difficult time for us all.
He is? I'm not sure how to feel about that.  Perhaps it's for the better.
He moved in with her the day after the fire. Even I find that suspicious.
Heard about that, did you? Yes, I went out for a pint or two. What of it?
Hello there, friend. How lucky for you to chance upon a bard on the road.
Hello, dear husband. Have you brought more silver jewelry for me to sell?
Here are the Akaviri - the Blades - you see their distinctive longswords.
Here you are. Always good to see a fellow bard. Tell Giraud I said hello.
Here, let me give you this. It's the least I can do for all your trouble.
Here's everythin' you need. You get caught, and we've never heard of you.
Hmm? What? Project? You think you could help me? I really don't think so.
Hmm. I don't want to get involved in anything beneath my dignity as Jarl.
Hmm... All right, yes, I see your point. Make the necessary arrangements.
Hope this war lasts long enough that I get to fight in it. Battle! Glory!
How do you think? He's a pig. All I am to him is a warm body to lay with.
I could have left it behind. I could have put it back where it came from.
I could not raise him, but I will raise an army to avenge his defilement!
I do. There is a freedom the roads give you that the stronghold does not.
I don't care if Vex was chosen as a Guild Third over me, she deserved it.
I don't get much time time off from the tavern, but I enjoy it when I do.
I don't know what the fight is about, and that's not our business anyway.
I don't want to see you treating any of these books poorly. Are we clear?
I got mine off of a merchant ship in Solitude. Worst mistake I ever made.
I grant you this weapon from the armory to serve as your badge of office.
I hope Fjotra is happy in the temple. We're so honored to have given her.
I hope it was important, because it means you weren't here to defend him.
I just care about my husband so much and I hate to see him in this state.
I knew you had it in you. After all, finding the Stones was no easy feat.
I left something there for you. If you're inclined to take that approach.
I may have roots in Cyrodiil, but Skyrim's as much my home as any Nord's.
I need to ask you to stop. That... shouting... is making people nervous. 
I need to get into my traveling gear. Give me a minute and I'll be ready.
I need you to collect some dragon scales. And not just any dragon scales.
I need you to go speak to Jorn. He was preparing the Effigy of King Olaf.
I never returned to that pig farm you know. There's nothing for me there.
I never saw this coming, I thought we were just having a run of bad luck.
I prefer working in silver. More skill needed than forging iron or steel.
I see you've been minding your own business. So how is the mind business?
I see. The dragon will lead you to Alduin, but without the Jarl's help...
I still can't believe Isabella's gone. She was such a helpful young lass.
I still can't believe you were able to help Ranmir pull himself together.
I still have my key to the library. Whenever you're ready, let's move on.
I suppose it would be better than sitting around thinking about all this.
I suppose. But Svari, we don't steal. We're better than that. Understand?
I swear, those scheming elves charge us twice what anyone else would pay.
I thought the the Gray Quarter would be a haven for my kind. I was wrong.
I trust you've come to see the error handing the hold over to the rebels?
I try not to think about how my uncle got all the Dwemer Centurion parts.
I visited the meaderies of Riften once, as a lad. Wish I had their skill.
I was named after the sound a lion makes. You know: rrroooaaaarr! Really.
I wish I was a soldier! They get to travel and stay up late and have fun!
I won't repeat them, and I won't allow them to be spread under this roof.
I wonder how many poor souls have lost their lives working these tunnels.
I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in her stories.
I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in his stories.
I'll be damned if I'm going to lose her to... well, to whatever they are.
I'll deal with my uncle. Just... go! Scour this place from top to bottom!
I'll never surrender Skyrim into the hands of a corrupt and dying Empire.
I'm glad you agree. I was starting to wonder whose side you were on here.
I'm going to rest up here a while before heading to Windhelm. Be careful.
I'm innocent. The Nords framed me. I was nowhere near that murder weapon.
I'm not paying any of you a single septim... ever! Now get out of my inn!
I'm not really sure. I think it's just a minor miscalculation on my part.
I'm sending you to clear out Fort Hraagstad. If you survive, you'll pass.
I'm still finding your Spiced Wine to be the best drink I've ever tasted.
I've been thinking of hunting out beyond the boundaries of Whiterun hold.
I've brought a friend. Someone who can help. A bodyguard. To protect you.
I've read the dragon language, but to hear it spoken is most interesting.
I've seen enough to know their fabric. The warp of air, the weft of time.
If anyone saw anything, step forward. Otherwise, step away from the body!
If the gods are merciful, they've found a safe place to hide in the city.
If Torygg couldn't defend his throne, he had no business being High King.
If you get me the logbook, I'll have proof of Shatter-Shield's treachery.
If you have any news of the western holds, take it to Ulfric immediately.
If you have need of hunting supplies then you've come to the right place.
If you want to ask her about them, good luck. But I'm not going near her.
If you wouldn't mind bringing this back to her for us, I'd appreciate it.
If you'll stand back, I'll perform the ritual granted to me by Lady Mara.
Is that so? Well, perhaps a night in jail might loosen your tongue. Hmmm?
It has done a good thing. It will take this gift as a token of gratitude.
It is a strange sight, the white flakes that sometimes fall from the sky.
It may take you a couple of tries, but that's what practice is all about.
It means so much to us to have the claw back where it belongs. Thank you!
It would seem you're not the accomplished pickpocket you think you are...
It's not exactly forbidden, but even so... it's not true. So that's that.
It's true. For as long as I can remember our crops have always done well.
Jarl gets booted from Dawnstar, and I'm still stuck cleaning up the dirt.
Judging by your armor, I'd say you're an Imperial scout. If so, well met.
Keep an eye out for wolves if you're headed up the path to High Hrothgar.
Kind of fun to push people around sometimes, isn't it. Good work, sister.
Leave me alone. I just want to find my way out of this accursed province.
Let's just say my mother knows which pockets to line and keep it at that.
Little fool's going to experience the hard reality of Skyrim justice, eh?
Look, I didn't ask for this job, I got stuck with it thanks to my father.
Loyal Nords are always welcome here. Anyone else better watch their step.
M'aiq knows much, and tells some. M'aiq knows many things others do not. 
Make yourself at home, please. Let me know if I can be of any assistance.
Mara will always accept into her arms should you seek return to her fold.
Mara's mercy! A dragon... in Helgen? Why, it could be here at any moment!
Master Borri will teach you the first Word of a new Shout. Attend to him.
Master Wulfgar will now gift you with his knowledge of [QUOTE]Dah.[QUOTE]
May Arkay bless you with a long life, a proud death, and a restful grave.
Maybe when this is all over, you could sign one of your cookbooks for me?
Might be worth riding out to Solitude, see if a messenger ship's come in.
Morthal used to be a quiet place. But then, the world used to make sense.
Most here are up to something, of course, but in his case, it's not good.
My contact, she says Hammerfell steel is much desired by certain parties.
My days at the College are long behind me, but I prefer to stay close by.
My master can be a bit short-tempered, but I've learned so much from him.
Name's Garthar. Remember it, because you're going to hear a lot about me.
Necromancy? I am a member of the College of Winterhold, in good standing!
Next time, come see my at my shop. I've got some things you'll just love.
Next time, keep your plans quieter and nothing would have happened to it.
Niluva, you promised me you'd pay me back yesterday. So what's the story?
No one does. I've even taken the damn thing to the College of Winterhold.
No risk, no reward. That's the way it goes, so you better get used to it.
No, no, no. I need this job! This is the last place in town to have work.
No. Indeed not. But beware that your skill does not outstrip your wisdom.
No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart man steers clear of Stentor.
Now I know you've come by for more than just a visit. What did you bring?
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a mine that needs new workers to fill it.
Now the whole thing's over and done with. So let's stop talking about it.
Numinex was the dragon's name. That's his skull decorating the main hall.
Oh my. Probably something about the men. We all wish we had her problems.
Oh no! No, no, no. Narfi never got to say goodbye! Now Narfi's all alone.
Oh yeah. Pretty little thing. Had a room here I think. Ask the innkeeper.
Oh! That's right! Pelagius! Yes, yes, now I recall. Well done, well done.
On top of the Throat of the World is a patch of snow that's never melted.
One snap of her fingers, and you could end up in Riften Jail... or worse.
Ours is the only family left that truly cares what happens to Winterhold.
Prove worthy by warrior's test, and cross the bridge to the blessed hall.
Radiant Raiment has the finest attire in all of Skyrim. That is how we...
She's been dispatched to... eh... see to it that we get back on schedule.
Skjor was looking for you before. Talk to him before doing anything else.
Sky Haven Temple it is, then. I knew you'd have something for us, Esbern.
Skyrim's history of war is well documented here in Falkreath's graveyard.
So Cicero wasn't talking to anyone else. Just... the Night Mother's body?
So I ran. Joined the Forsworn. Started killing. Got caught. Now I'm here.
So many shadowy corners to strike from! I could learn to like this place.
So, what are your needs? Perhaps a pinch of this, and a bit of that? Hmm?
So, you're the one who barged into my home and laid waste to my projects.
So... carrying that weapon around like that makes you feel safe, does it?
Someone new, perhaps someone looking for me to mix something up for them?
Sorry, lass... I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time.
Stendarr's mercy - you aren't one of them. Please, you've got to help me!
Sure, sure. I'm a dirty beggar... why would you want to even speak to me.
Surely even down in Cyrodiil people have heard news of the war in Skyrim?
Take my advice. Never gamble. Damn Irnskar has me in debt up to the eyes.
Thank you, Lisbet. It's been such a joy to dine with you all these years.
Thank you! Thank you! I won't tell anyone what happened here, I swear it!
Thank you. Here, let an old alchemist pass on some of her secrets to you.
Thank you. Thank you, Dragonborn. You've done a great service for us all.
Thanks for the help. Not many willing to take on the Forsworn these days.
That is an old tale, but well known to those of us who serve in the keep.
That which is unknown can create unease, even fear. It is to be expected.
The Braidwood Inn's up that way. I know the innkeeper - Iddra. Nice lady.
The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes.
The copy is incomplete, it's aged to the point that parts are unreadable.
The first line is the walls around this city and the men who patrol them.
The Greybeards seem to think you're the Dragonborn. I hope they're right.
The harshness of Skyrim has a way of carving a man down to his true self.
The longer we travel the roads of Skyrim, the more empty this land seems.
The mages are up in the College. You can ask them, if they'll let you in.
The mines are hard, but Malacath rewards those who rise to the challenge.
The only grownups who talk to me are the kind I don't want talking to me.
The Stonefist's no fool. He's found the Crown. But we'll get to it first.
The Stormcloaks can keep this city safe better than those Legion lapdogs.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Eastmarch. Congratulations.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Falkreath. Congratulations.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Haafingar. Congratulations.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of the Reach. Congratulations.
Then the leader of our clan... Garthek... he ordered us to kill the rest.
Then you finally know what it means to be a true hunter, in the Nord way.
There's a... ghost. Just wandering around my inn like it owned the place.
There's no need to thank me. What you did was for the people of Dawnstar.
There's nothing like fishing on Lake Honrich, you should try it sometime.
There's only the shards of the blade left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?
They got used to Idgrod just fine, didn't they? So what's the difference?
They'll have barricades set, destroy them quickly. Keep pressing forward.
Thief, eh? It's never too late to take charge of your own fate, you know.
This is what you wanted? Shield brothers and sisters killing each other? 
This place is amazing! It's hard to believe that mortal hands built them.
Too bad, looks like I need to find someone else to take care of business.
Until the Key is returned, I will never set foot inside that place again.
Valmir, you rat. You're not a soldier at all! Must be one of the Thalmor!
We don't anticipate any real violence, but it never hurts to be prepared.
We don't know that. We don't even know what it is. Where is Aren, anyway?
We have sworn loyalty to Yamarz. He will see us through these dark times.
We'll need trained, disciplined and creative warriors ready for all that.
We're backing Elisif. When the Moot meets, they'll do the sensible thing.
We're backing Erikur. When the Moot meets, they'll do the sensible thing.
We're making our money back, bit by bit. Every extra bit of work helps...
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle over in the Rift.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle up in Hjaalmarch.
Welcome to the Winking Skeever. Take a load off and enjoy the atmosphere.
Well dear, you know where to find me if it ever becomes too much for you.
Well it's about time! I had to stall the captain until you were finished.
Well, at least this post is safe enough. Come on, let's get back to work.
Well, I see your wounds have healed but your pride still needs some time.
Well, it shows. Your skill rivals some of the greatest miners I've known.
Well, looks like you and I are going to have to get very well acquainted.
Well, until they do, I don't have any business to discuss with outsiders.
Were I able to provide it, I'd shower you in wealth for what you've done.
What do you do when a customer can't afford to pay for a meal or a drink?
What? Who are you? Oh, never mind. Cut me down before that thing gets us!
What's that you said? Dragonborn? Then... there really is hope after all?
Whatever it is you're up to at the College, you need to fix this at once!
Whatever it is, I'm sure I can't be of help. I'm just here on... holiday.
When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it. Otherwise, mind your business.
When my wife died, I wasn't sure I could let her go. Now I don't have to.
When Ulfric unleashed such fury, my husband he... he simply ceased to be.
Who in Dagon's name are you? Speak, or I'll cut you down where you stand.
Why don't you have yourself a drink at the Moorside before you head back?
Why talk? Cicero has nothing to say to you. Call it a matter of... trust.
Wonderful. I hadn't really hoped to run in to someone who had been there.
Work continues on the Eye of Magnus, as it has been commonly referred to.
Wow. Nice weapon! Can I hold it? I promise not to break anything. Honest!
Yamarz was a fool. Always trying to scheme his way out of responsibility.
Yeah! It'll teach them to steal from us! One of them took my good helmet.
Yes, yes. Which is why I allowed this... violation of all our traditions.
You and the Jarl will answer for any desecration of my ancestors' bodies.
You are a disgrace to the Altmer. I should kill you on general principle.
You assaulted one of my family members. I've come to accept your apology.
You come all this way just to hurt me a second time? Get out of my sight!
You did it. You killed it. Now cut me down before anything else shows up.
You don't have to, because it's utter nonsense. It's never going to work.
You don't know what freedom really means until you've lived on the river.
You going to buy something or just here for training? Otherwise, move on.
You look like an adventurous one. I bet we're kindred spirits, you and I.
You mistake me. I'm not saying no - just wondering about your intentions.
You need to find and kill Safia, the captain of the pirate ship Red Wave.
You were at Helgen when it was attacked? You saw this with your own eyes?
You'll be able to run circles around the big, slow brutes in Heavy Armor.
You're putting your hand... in my pocket? Have you gone complete cracked?
You're right. Malacath teaches us to meet our fate. Perhaps this is mine.
You've heard too? They say the town was completely destroyed by a dragon.
... for in my current condition, I'll never be able to lay my hands on it.
A heathen. Lovely. Oh, don't put on that angry look. I'm just teasing you.
A little Wheat and Blisterwort makes a healing potion, if you didn't know.
A truce? With the Imperials? They'll murder us all, first chance they get.
According to legend. Although I never thought to put the tale to the test.
Aerin, you never cease to amaze me. You always see the good in everything.
After what happened to those other women, I'm worried about my own safety.
Ah ha ha! You mortals and your frail, limp, pathetic bodies. Try it again.
Ah, excellent. Well, it's good to know that won't be a problem any longer.
Ah, it's not been more than a few days since they came down the last time.
Ah, my disciples have sent me a fresh soul. Good. I was getting... hungry.
Ah, there's nothing like fresh air and honest labor to bolster the spirit.
An excellent elixir. Your technique shows a command of the alchemical art.
And speak to Eorlund if you want a better weapon than... whatever that is.
Another time, or not at all. It's really none of your business, after all.
Are you kidding me? I fought off all those bandits. I'm not afraid of you.
As you may be aware Elisif's husband High King Torygg was recently killed.
At the Bards College in Solitude. They train bards and skalds like myself.
Aye. Aringoth sent the city guard packing and fortified the entire island.
Be careful looking for those teeth... those little bastards are dangerous.
Be mindful.  My maid Tekla has been known to pass information to Siddgeir.
Be sure to watch your finger positions. Especially during the transitions.
Being a priest of Vaermina put me very close to dark sorcery at its worst.
Beitild thinks I drink on the job. Well, what does it matter if I do? Huh?
Best we all forget about her. Bad luck to talk about the dead in Markarth.
Bring all four to me, and I shall use them to inscribe the spells for you.
But is it safe for you to be here? Won't the Imperials be looking for you?
By Imperial Law banning Talos, we have the right to do whatever we want.  
By the gods! The Gourmet and the chef have poisoned the Emperor! Get them!
Calm down there, whelp. Don't feel like you need to show off for our sake.
Can you believe those pathetic Gray-Manes still show their face in public?
Come now, where's your sense of propriety? Extorting an old man like this.
Come on now, you're a sharp one. You must have heard of werewolves before.
Come to think of it, I haven't seen Svidi in a while. Wait... he didn't...
Damn it, Talen. We still don't have enough this year to get out of Riften.
Dengeir deserves more respect than his nephew, Jarl Siddgeir, affords him.
Destroy Vighar, my long dead vampire ancestor. Have you changed your mind?
Did you hear that? A metal on stone sound... hmmm, perhaps it was nothing.
Did you know Vittoria is the Emperor's cousin? Best stay on her good side.
Did you? So Ulag didn't make it passed those giants then? More's the pity.
Do not forsake your heart, child, for it may one day come to surprise you.
Do you hate the dark elves? Are you here to bully us and tell us to leave?
Don't you know? What drew you here? Surely your dreams showed you the way?
Elenwen is a formidable woman. She lacks for neither cunning nor ambition.
Even rags would be preferable to your current wardrobe. Or lack thereof...
Ever since Dustman's Cairn, the big crawly ones have been too much for me.
Far back in the Mythic Era, the dragons were worshipped as gods in Skyrim.
Fine, tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
Fine. I'll wait until someone else with a little more courage comes along.
First, let us see if you truly are Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice.
Folks at court won't admit it, but Sybille Stentor scares us all to death.
Forsworn have troubled the Reach for too long. I intend to deal with them.
Forsworn rampaging through the streets. As if business wasn't slow enough.
From Riverwood? The road south through Falkreath is the most direct route.
Get yourself kitted out with what you need. Welcome to the fight, brother!
Girduin died first. It happened so fast, none of us had a chance to react.
Glad to see you're making new friends. I know Jon's death was hard on you.
Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage too, I see, so that's done.
Got some fresh-baked bread an' good cheese, if you're after a bite to eat.
Greta is taking it hardest. She won't go to the Temple of Divines anymore.
Ha, I knew you'd join up! Great news. We'll take back Skyrim together, eh?
Hagraven or horker, it matters not. We've got the arrows to fell any game.
Have them send some men - with a new wagon. This one isn't going anywhere.
Have you heard? There's been another dragon attack. Kynesgrove, this time.
He fought on the wrong side, and he paid for it. That's all I have to say.
He is the King in Rags. A man who once held all the Reach within his grip.
He requests more barrels of ichor to be delivered to the Arcanex tomorrow.
He's been complaining of a member of the College running amok in his hold.
Head on in. Keep your nose clean, and you won't have any problems with us.
Hello. I'm Gisli. But you can just call me Erikur's sister. Everyone does.
Hey friend, you wouldn't happen to be looking for unusual items would you?
Hmm. It feels like a mistake to me, but I'll bow to your judgment on this.
Hmm... what is that? Some kind of stone claw? I wonder what it's used for.
Hope Pavo will be able to go back to his mine soon. Everyone needs a home.
How about a septim? Wait, make that two septims, I feel like living it up.
How appropriate they should live in the Ratway with the rest of the trash.
How kind of you. And I've brought an army to give you a going away parade.
Hrmph. You're no fun at all. Guess I'll have to make my own fun elsewhere.
Huh? That sounds ominous. Are you getting yourself into even more trouble?
I can see it in your eyes - you've seen the land of the gods and returned.
I can't afford to send anyone else. And we don't know where the dragon is.
I don't know. If you see any big strong men around, let us know, will you?
I don't need to know the details. Blessings of Arkay to you for your help.
I guess I should be getting back to work. It was more fun talking, though.
I guess there's nothing for it. We'll have to ask the Greybeards for help.
I have many important things on my mind. Your concerns are not among them.
I have. I think we may have to turn this one over to the Dark Brotherhood.
I hope my son has found some nice, well-mannered girl to settle down with.
I hope you're not here to start some trouble. I'll fight you if I have to.
I knew that stupid kid would try and find a way to weasel out of his debt.
I overheard Bolli say that only the Jarl carries the key to the warehouse.
I pay a good wage for any iron ore you dig up, if you're looking for work.
I plan to spend all the days I got left on the water. It's where I belong.
I play the lute. If you'd like to hear something, it only costs five gold.
I still can't believe it. You, the Arch-Mage? Never would have guessed it.
I suppose in wartime, people aren't looking to part with their old junk...
I think I may wait until the Burning of King Olaf to have and Spiced Wine.
I think our flutist here has gotten better since the Burning of King Olaf.
I think you better listen to Mercer and Brynjolf first. We can talk later.
I warned them it might be dangerous. It's not my fault they didn't listen.
I was just getting used to that ghost being here, and poof, now he's gone.
I will not surrender Markarth without raising my own sword in her defense.
I work at the lumber mill, but I escape into the forest whenever possible.
I'd appreciate if you don't bother my wife, Tova. She's still in mourning.
I'd rather take a moment and look around than walk blindly into an ambush.
I'd request that when speaking to Jarl Laila, you show the proper respect.
I'll do anything if it means saving my brother. You'll join us, won't you?
I'll fight you again, but not until you have the gold to back up your bet.
I'll need to lock up the store. Thank you so much for agreeing to help us.
I'll teach you how to use it effectively, and keep you quick on your feet.
I'm a Dark Elf and I live in Windhelm, so yes, I live in the Gray Quarter.
I'm afraid she's right. I'm deeply sorry that this has to come between us.
I'm afraid the Winterhold you see before you is somewhat... underwhelming.
I'm just worried about raising a child in the middle of this war of yours.
I'm kind of busy, but if you need any potions or ingredients, let me know.
I'm not exactly built for manual labor. Now come on, you've almost got it.
I'm not looking for special treatment, Aval. All I did was talk to Ulfric.
I'm not proud of Hrefna's father. If she knew him, she wouldn't be either.
I'm sorry, that's just not possible. It would cause far too many problems.
I'm stuck fighting a giant now, thanks to you. So you're going to help me.
I'm sure he'll behave himself for the rest of the evening, won't you dear?
I'm sure someone of your disposition will probably even find it enjoyable.
I'm sure we'll get our gold at some point. Not like he has anywhere to go.
I'm trying to do as little as possible. You're getting in the way of that.
I've been watching the way you mine and I have to say, I'm very impressed.
I've got a bit of an errand to perform, but I need an extra pair of hands.
I've heard. Bolli and Keerava were speaking of it just a little while ago.
If it was easy, I would have hired a local thug instead of a professional.
If it wasn't for all the dangers in here, this place could almost be cozy.
If the news from Helgen is true... well, there's no telling what it means.
If these ruins frighten you, take comfort in the knowledge that I am here.
If they want my city, they're going to have to take it from me personally.
If this plan works, not only is my debt gone, but I'll be set up for life.
If we killed a dragon once, we can do it again. With your help, of course.
If you don't have a good reason to be partnered with Karliah, you're dead.
If you don't trust me, you were a fool to walk in here in the first place.
If you don't watch it, I may actually start to respect you. Job well done.
If you meet anyone in your travels who needs good steel, send them my way.
If you think you can hold Riften, you're as deluded as you've always been.
Ignore the talk of spirits and creatures and such. It's just superstition.
Ill luck. I'm a busy man and I don't have time for this sort of frivolity.
Important? Far more than even she realizes! If you are Dragonborn, then...
In return, Maven allowed us to extort Aringoth and bring in a huge payout.
Iron or steel is what you need. Leave that fancy Elven stuff to the Elves.
Is any man ever ready to give the order that will mean the deaths of many.
Is everything all right? I've not heard from Sorli or Pactur in some time.
It means resting your haunches in Whiterun more than I'd care to, for one.
It was nice to spend time with someone who enjoys archery as much as I do.
It's a blessing given to some of us. We can be like wild beasts. Fearsome.
It's about time someone arrived. Here, make sure this is handled properly.
It's an honor, champion. Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven.
It's an old city, I can tell you that. The Palace of the Kings is ancient.
It's Riften's name for the sewers beneath our feet. Absolutely disgusting!
It's somewhere around here, Agna said to look to the Bear to find the way.
Just make certain you keep your eyes open. Karliah is as sharp as a blade.
Keep your eyes open for ambushes. These forts have too many blind corners.
Kharag, take a break and drink with me! Those trees aren't going anywhere!
Killed my first creature in a cave just like this... I'll never forget it.
Kind of fun to push people around sometimes, isn't it. Good work, brother.
Know that you have set in motion a chain of events that cannot be stopped.
Last I'd heard, he'd been carted off to Northwatch Keep. Ever heard of it?
Let's just call it a [QUOTE]difference of opinion[QUOTE] with the College.
Let's see if you can make a hide helmet. Here's the rest of what you need.
Like others before you, you blindly follow a path to your own destruction.
Little blood to clear the air. Hope you have the stomach for it, outsider.
Look, a cave. An exciting place to venture, if you know what you're doing.
Markarth remains allied to the Empire, under the authority of Jarl Igmund.
Matter of fact, I do. They've been fair enough with me, far as I can tell.
May the strength and truth of your Voice serve you well. Breath and focus.
Me, I've got my axe, my wife Gerdur and my boy Frodnar. That's all I need.
My appetite for Mercer's demise exceeds my craving for wealth, Your Grace.
My father is Alvor, the blacksmith. I'm his assistant. I mean, apprentice.
My father says we need to just get on with our lives. Like it's that easy.
My parents keep a close eye on the miners. They can't be trusted too much.
Never. They've shut us down forever, Enmon. The Divines have abandoned us.
No. We'll stay. Out of respect for the Dragonborn and our Greybeard hosts.
Not a day passes that I don't wonder if life would be better in Morrowind.
Not much. One moment I was buying a necklace, and the rest is just a blur.
Not that I'd ever get involved in any of those kinds of things, of course.
Now shouldn't you be off arranging our wedding day? Don't keep me waiting.
Now. Enough. We will speak no more of this. I am the only friend you need.
Oh, be certain to purchase my Falmer translation tome when it's completed!
Oh, certainly I hope not! That would be quite unfortunate for my research.
Oh, they care all right. Just none of them thinks to do anything about it.
On rumor and gossip? No. But you, a stranger, might find the truth for us.
One day, I must fight my brother Nagrub for chiefdom. It will not be easy.
One taste will lead to nearly instant death, so don't even think about it.
Only rumors. He used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down.
Only thing I hate worse than those scale-backs are them filthy gray-skins!
Only your death or an apology will restore my family's honor. Last chance.
Orgnar, this is it. The inn is yours. I'm probably never coming back here.
Our contract is complete. Here's a token of my gratitude for your efforts.
Pay no attention to him. A ponderous windbag, like most Imperial generals.
Please make sure this arrives in a timely manner. And don't scratch it up.
Please make sure your hands are clean before touching anything, all right?
Please, tell me more about yourself. What brings you to this... to Skyrim?
Real men prove their love. Words are as empty as the air they run through.
Ri'saad is the head of a small syndicate of independent merchant families.
Savos Aren is wise beyond his years. He knows real talent when he sees it.
She thinks she's in love with Bassianus and wants to leave town. With him.
Shor's Crown, that woman never gives up. I guess that's why I married her.
Since we're short on soldiers you'll be coming with us, too. No arguments.
Smart thing you did, buying Honeyside. Nice place, and why pay for an inn?
So you can tell that heartless Daedra bitch I'm done doing her dirty work.
So you say. We'll see if that's true when the Stormcloaks make their move.
So you think you can make it on your own, then? We'll just see about that.
So, you made it out of there alive. Ancano was right... you are dangerous.
So. The King of Corruption sends his messenger to challenge me. Very well.
Speak to Beirand, he's normally out by the forge. He'll get you outfitted.
Ssshhh.... Please. There is much... I have to say. And... not much time...
Svari, Jala said you stole an apple from her cart yesterday. Is this true?
Sven has the voice of a snow lark. Only good thing he got from his father.
Thank the gods. Now let's deal with these other hunters. We hunt together!
Thanks for the compliment, Delvin. I may just take you up on that one day.
That's fine. I have a special occasion coming up, and I'd like to have it.
That's the way I like it. Short and bloody. They never knew what hit them.
The blade is a weapon. A tool. Tools are meant to be broken. And repaired.
The Companions are my family. We fight so that other people don't have to.
The Guild is back on its feet again and on its way to a prosperous future.
The Mortar and Pestle has cures for every illness, from Ataxia to Witbane.
The selection seems small, but we can provide whatever you need. Just ask.
The sooner you find the claw, the sooner our lives can get back to normal.
The townsfolk call me [QUOTE]captain[QUOTE] because I used to be a sailor.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Hjaalmarch. Congratulations.
Then I need your help and there isn't anyone I can trust here in the city.
There ain't much more to tell... they're haunted and you should stay away.
There's a dragon. Here. In Dragonsreach. And I thought it was just a name.
They say there's nothing a Nord woman can't do if she puts her mind to it.
They used to be something. Nowadays they just squabble amongst themselves.
They've been told to stay out of the city, but keep trying to get back in.
This is my realm now. I've sacrificed too much to let you take it from me!
Those milk drinkers? Might as well be elves. Think they're better than us.
To hold any hope of defeating Mercer, we must have Nocturnal at our backs.
To tell you the truth, Sabjorn isn't much of an owner. Slave driver, sure.
Too bad we can't read these carvings. Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?
We are the only group left in Skyrim dedicated to the study of the arcane.
We don't get many people like you visiting Winterhold. Usually it's elves.
We have to find another way out of here before the place fills with water!
We intend to prove the superiority of Mer over Man, one century at a time.
We left Sirgar in charge back at Stonehills. I hope that wasn't a mistake.
We now fight our way to Castle Dour to cut the head off the legion itself!
We'll stay here and see if we can find anything else that could be of use.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle down in Falkreath.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle over in Eastmarch.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle over in the Reach.
Well, here as in this plane. Mundus. Tamriel. Nearby, relatively speaking.
Well, I don't think you should stay things like that about the Ambassador!
Well, make sure we keep the patrols out night and day, just to be certain.
Well... maybe not. Dragons haven't been seen in Skyrim for an age or more.
What you learn here will last you a lifetime. Several, if you're talented.
What? Are you telling me you robbed it? Why? Why are you doing this to me?
What? You dare challenge Ma'randru-jo? You will suffer for your insolence!
What's the matter, I thought you people were used to indentured servitude.
When I return to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready to help trap this dragon.
When I was a child, I dreamed about having a fort like this all to myself.
When you come to your senses, find me there and we'll discuss your future.
When you're in your grave and I'm standing over it. Now get out of my way!
Where they operate within the shadows, we operated on the side of justice.
Whether this was intentional or not, it suggests some interesting results.
While you're in there, help yourself to anything in Frey's manor. I would.
Whiterun is the crown jewel of Skyrim, and you would leave us defenseless?
Yes, my youngest son. He's a dark child. I don't know what to do with him.
Yes, when we buried my husband I wasn't able to make an offering to Talos.
Yes, yes, that's quite enough celebration. Let's send you ahead, shall we?
You are bold, wunduniik. You dare enter a Dovah's home without permission.
You could see that if you had any faith left in that black heart of yours.
You don't prepare the meat with any of those strange Elven spices, do you?
You know, Hulda, there's this lovely Argonian ballad I've been studying...
You made it out alive, at least. Your gear's safe in my room, as promised.
You must be mad to think I'd allow anyone to see it before it's completed.
You own Proudspire Manor, hmm? Beautiful house. At least from the outside.
You reek. A little friendly advice - take a bath and get some new clothes.
You saved my life. I won't forget it. Look me up if you're ever in Riften.
You see only me because your heart knows only me as the Companions leader.
You smell like dead cat. Can I assume Ma'randru-jo has been taken care of?
You there! You look like a sympathetic soldier. I require your assistance!
You think so, huh? Maybe you'd like to put some septims behind that boast.
You want to pay me to do my job? Fine. I'll mark the location on your map.
You watch yourself on that island. Those mercenaries don't take prisoners.
You would give your own coin to help my son? I'm moved by your compassion.
You? An outsider? I'd sooner slit my own throat than accept help from you.
You. You a Dark Elf lover? Get out of our city, you filthy piece of trash.
You'll be provided all of the power and knowledge befitting a Nightingale.
You'll see! It was a dragon! It'll kill us all and then you'll believe me!
You're just going to walk away from your betrothal? Get out of the temple.
You've dealt with us fairly so far. You've heard our demand. What say you?
You've done your duty and we're all very grateful. Now... I'd like to eat.
Your payment awaits. And don't worry, I'm not stupid enough to betray you.
Ysgramor was the hero who started the Companions. Wuuthrad was his weapon.
Ysmir's beard! You're one after my own heart. I would love another bottle.
...dear Cicero will keep you from harm, sweet Mother. Forever and always...
[QUOTE]Holding him[QUOTE]? Why I've got him in my cellar. He's my prisoner.
A hearty welcome to Falkreath!  All of Skyrim's true sons are welcome here!
A man like me makes a lot of enemies. People are always trying to cheat me.
A traveler? I'll be you've seen some sights. We should swap tales sometime.
Actually just a bottle for me today. I'm thinking of giving it to Vivienne.
Aela said you were hers, and I wasn't supposed to interfere. She scares me.
Ah, there we have it. This will be all I need to have Ogmund taken care of.
All right, all right. Just bring it to me tomorrow and I'll fix it for you.
All right. It's time to deliver the final blow to the Stormcloak rebellion.
All that matters is that I have what you need. And it's worth every septim.
Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. No telling what we'll find down here.
An astute question, for we are far from home and this is a cold, hard land.
As we walk these stone passages, we delve into the very bones of the earth.
As you venture, Mara fills my mind ever more with visions of love in peril.
Astrid is dead. It is as it should be. May she find redemption in the Void.
Aye, and the sons of Skyrim will greet that dawn teeth and swords flashing.
Aye. She's helping me in the house, and even helps her father at the forge.
Being masters of the Thu'um, they could kill you by uttering a single word.
Besides, you look like your pockets are a little light on coin, am I right?
Brandishing your weapon is not going to help you negotiate a better sale...
But I don't want to be patient! I want my dress right now! Father promised!
But you will know him when you see him. He's the one who made me like this!
Careful at Mercer's place, I don't want to lose anyone else to that madman.
Careful. No telling what will happen the next time you mess with that door.
Civilized people don't brandish their weapons unless they plan to use them.
Confound it all. I was quite sure I was invisible, or at least transparent.
Constance tries to stop her, and is real good to us, but it's never enough.
Dealing with a mob wouldn't be good for my coin purse. Fine. We're leaving.
Delvin Mallory and the Dark Brotherhood have... history. He can be trusted.
Destroy them quickly, and take out the archers in the towers along the way.
Do this right, and I can promise you a permanent place in our organization.
Do you have any idea what that little stunt you pulled is going to cost me?
Doing nothing will not grant our tribe relief from this curse. We must try.
Don't get too comfortable here, mortal. You may actually earn your way out.
Don't suppose you'd enchant my sword? Dull old blade can barely cut butter.
Dragonborn, Dragonborn, by his honor is sworn, To keep evil forever at bay!
Endon, we talked about this... Are you still disappointed in Cade's choice?
Fat Toad 190 is always a crowd-pleaser. Father could probably charge extra.
Feel free to return to me with questions. The Blue Palace is an open forum.
Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven, if you have the strength.
For a generous fellow traveler? But of course. What would you like to hear?
Get nervous around dwarven stonework. Legends say these cities are haunted.
Go fiddling with any locks around here, we're going to have a real problem.
Gods.... You two head inside and get some rest. I'll send word to the Jarl.
Got a lot of nerve coming down here. People tend to get hurt in the Ratway.
Great! I'll unlock the door and meet you inside, then you can lead the way.
Ha! That ain't nothing. Wait till you see what I got planned for next week.
Ha! There's nothing like a few cuts and bruises to drive home a point, huh?
Have you, by chance, seen my research notes? I seem to have misplaced them.
He brought me back here, and I realized... that I was actually coming home.
He did the honorable thing, even when he knew it would cost him everything.
He is the God of Mercy. The patron of order and justice for all of Tamriel.
Heard about what you did. Killing those foul witches. Well done, Companion.
Here, this is all can afford to give you as compensation. Hope it's enough.
Hey, greenskin... close your mouth. Some of us are trying to eat over here.
Hmmm... A question I am all to familiar with. One my very Thanes ask often.
Hmph. No, friend, that I'm not. But I get along with your kind well enough.
Hush, Veezara. You were very brave. Astrid may well be dead if not for you.
I bumped into them when I was coming back to my farm after buying supplies.
I came to Skyrim looking for a better life. So what did I get? Another war.
I don't blame you for being angry about it. I would be, too, in your shoes.
I don't know what to believe. If it's true, then dark times may be upon us.
I don't know what you did, but Braith won't even look at me now! So thanks!
I don't want some snotty elf telling me what gods I can and can't worship. 
I get lost sometimes. I'm not sure where I go, but I'm not... I'm not here.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised with the way things are going around here.
I hate this place. I hate the trees. I hate the rocks. And I hate the snow.
I have two more bushels for you, Marise. That should keep you well-stocked.
I hope one day to find out what happened to me... how I ended up like that.
I know of your deeds, and am honored to address a member of the Companions.
I learn much from Garakh every day. I must learn if I am to take her place.
I married Rustleif when he was in Hammerfell, apprenticing under my father.
I miss Reyda. She was so nice to Narfi. Narfi's sad he can't be with Reyda.
I only counsel caution. We cannot afford to act rashly in times like these.
I really must get back to my duties. This fort isn't going to clean itself.
I see why the Nords like Skyrim. This crisp air is wonderful for the lungs!
I still can't believe he knew what he was doing when he opened that gate...
I think that maybe Kodlak was right. As a werewolf, I can't be a good Nord.
I think you overestimate Ulfric's chances. He's stretched himself too thin.
I try not to think of her, but sometimes the simplest thing will remind me.
I understand what potions do, but I don't always understand how they do it.
I used to be. There isn't much time for that in my life anymore I'm afraid.
I want her notes. You think you could get them for me, without her knowing?
I wonder if the College's reptuation will ever recover from our adventures.
I wonder what we could've done with the Eye, had it been put to better use?
I would simply ask that you trust me and help me end Dawnstar's nightmares.
I... see. I trust that Tolfdir will provide a more... specific explanation.
I'd simply snap my fingers, and everyone in Skyrim would die. War resolved.
I'll be sure to put in a good word for you if I get back to Solitude first.
I'll go with you, but when things are back to normal I want an explanation.
I'm assuming you're here for more than a social call. Down to business, eh?
I'm ever so grateful. Please, give my regard to the rest of the Companions.
I'm here to buy food, Nazeem. I suppose you don't need to worry about that.
I'm just the Housecarl. If you need something, you should speak to Kraldar.
I'm off work at the Black-Briar Meadery. I'll be back there in the morning.
I'm sorry to hear that. I thought you'd finally seen through Ulfric's lies.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap. Just... these hunters. We're all on edge.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to the Summerset Isle.
I'm still looking for someone to deliver my message to Sibbi Black-Briar...
I'm sure the guards have the matter well in hand. Now, if you'll excuse me.
I'm surprised you're even showing your face around here after what you did.
I've been a bit out of sorts since... since our daughter was taken from us.
I've been a part of this Guild for as long as Mercer has been Guild Master.
I've got a top man on the job right now. He should be returning any moment.
I've worked with metal long enough that I almost never burn myself anymore.
If a man can't feel at home in a freezing cave, then he isn't truly a Nord.
If he keeps it, I will bide my time. If he returns it to you, it means war.
If it weren't for Michel, I'd probably be dead in a Markarth gutter by now.
If the guards would listen to Viola, they'd have caught the Butcher by now.
If there's anything I can ever do for you, do not hesitate to call upon me!
If you leave that kinslayer Hroggar, I would be happy to keep your company.
If you're looking for potions you should talk to my aunt, Angeline Morrard.
If you're not going use that armor you dropped... do you mind if I take it?
If you're the best the Guild's got, they're in worse shape than I imagined.
In case Falk doesn't make it clear - Solitude owes you a debt of gratitude.
Is that an Amulet of Mara? I'm surprised someone like you isn't spoken for.
It got bad back in Cyrodiil. The war with the Thalmor ruined... everything.
It is said that an Orc first learns to wield a hammer in her mother's womb.
It probably took some Dwemer craftsman a year to build one of those things.
It was my home. But I left. The woods felt more alive, at least for a time.
It's a guild of Altmer thieves, they call themselves the Summerset Shadows.
It's always encouraging to see the younger generations embracing education.
It's been quite a boon, looking like a child. No one ever suspects a thing.
It's the part with the severed head I find most impressive. My compliments.
It's unfortunate that we live in such violent times, but there you have it.
J'zargo will go wherever he can to learn more. Oblivion itself, if need be.
Just round up the rest of the magical artifacts so that I can catalog them.
Justice can be harsh. But it is still justice. Paarthurnax deserves to die.
Keep looking, Unblooded. There's got to be some way to get that thing open.
Keep your eyes open. I'm not sure what to expect when we enter the cistern.
Kesh could tell you more. I just want out of Skyrim as quickly as possible.
Laelette? I thought she left to join the Stormcloaks. Ah! My poor Laelette!
Last time someone cheated me, I cut off their hand. Still have it actually.
Let the Forsworn ravage the Reach. Talos favors us. Our victory is assured.
Let's see where this goes. Better than going back outside with that dragon.
Likewise. Now, I have a lot to do, so I'm afraid you'll just have to leave!
Look around you. Winterhold is in this state because of those damned mages.
Look, in case you hadn't noticed, these aren't the glory days of the Guild.
Looking for work? I need someone to deliver a message to Sibbi Black-Briar.
Looking to do some hunting? Avoid Brittleshin Pass. It's southeast of here.
Mauhulakh's aunts. You know... the way they're all around him all the time.
Maybe you're not so soft, after all. Now you're ready for a real challenge.
Millwork sure is boring, but at least I don't have to work in a nasty mine.
My ears hear the truth in your words, and yet my body shakes with the need.
My husband Thonar handles all our family's business. He's an important man.
My wife's going to kill me when I tell her we'll need to bring another cow.
Nightcaller Temple is only a short walk from Dawnstar. Come, we must hurry.
No handouts today, Brenuin. Now scat. You'll scare off my paying customers.
No harm done. Tell this Endon fellow I hope he finds what he's looking for.
No, I don't think so. Respond to their request, and we'll leave it at that.
No! You can't be here! You're all dead! I already killed you over and over!
No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart woman steers clear of Stentor.
No... No, as tempting as it is, it won't do to have both sides angry at us.
Not a day goes by that I don't regret letting Sabjorn get as far as he did.
Not for me to say. You'll have to talk to Kodlak Whitemane up in Jorrvaskr.
Nothing but a bunch of lowly bandits. Cowards, who will take little effort.
Now that's a smart weapon. Light, strong, useful. Crack some skulls for me.
Now we can't cut them, and can't afford to buy another mill somewhere else.
Oh ho! What's with the weapon? Looks like it's about to get rough in here. 
Oh no! I couldn't. Mother says they are a burden we must bear for our gift.
Oh no. I hope not. But even I haven't seen him in years, and we were close.
Oh yes, quite fine. My accommodations here continue to be just what I need.
Oh, I am well. I will be well. Well to be within the will inside the walls.
Oh, I thought that matter was handled. I think Falk is taking care of that.
Oh, like the sleepy rebel supporters in this town are going to tell anyone.
Oh, wow. I knew it. I knew they were real! I have to remember to tell papa.
Okay. All right. Wonderful. You're welcome! I'll just be on my way, then...
Old lady Maiden-Loom owns the stables. But my father and me, we run things.
One day I will shape a weapon fit for a chief. Maybe that chief will be me.
One thing's certain. I intend to find out before she draws her last breath.
Only criminals get sent to Cidhna Mine. They're not going to send us there.
Orc town nearby. Between you and me, we should have had them out years ago.
Other prisoners get suspicious when we talk to each other, so keep it down.
Our access to those bits of luck are what separates us from common bandits.
Over there, please. Just opposite me. Wouldn't want anyone else in the way.
Paarthurnax is the only one who can answer your questions about Dragonrend.
Pigsticker like that's not going to get you far. Best visit the blacksmith.
Please forgive my mood. I'm still coming to terms with my daughter's death.
Please, please. I need but a septim. A septim is all I ask. Is that so bad?
Pretty quiet out here on the farm. My wife and I kind of like the solitude.
Pride of the what? This isn't the Legion, boss. We're miners, not soldiers.
Really should talk to Mulush if you have a problem with one of the workers.
Really, the nerve of some people, leaving their trash wherever they please.
Relax, Marise... I have no quarrel with you. I just wish to speak a moment.
Releasing a captured dragon. I don't think I'll ever understand that one...
Say as little as possible so as to avoid compromising our neutral position.
She's been complaining of a member of the College running amok in her hold.
She's not from Markarth. The air about her screamed [QUOTE]outsider.[QUOTE]
Siddgeir can sometimes act too quickly but he does listen to Helvard and I.
Silence will serve us well in this place. Let us take our foes by surprise.
So my brother really did it. Whiterun will be the toast of Skyrim for this!
So what's the plan, then? How do you intend to lure a dragon into the trap?
So you saw a dragon, did you? Tell me, what was it like? As big as a house?
So, the mage needs to be [QUOTE]taken care of,[QUOTE] if you understand me.
Some would say that all things must end, so that the next can come to pass.
Spread out and look for survivors. We need to know what we're dealing with.
Stormcloaks took Markarth. It is good to see Talos worshipped openly again.
Svari, you need to go home. Go home and stay there until your mother comes.
Tell me, why have you slain this one, who trusted you, here upon my shrine?
Tell me. Why do you come here, volaan? Why do you intrude on my meditation?
Tell the people of Markarth that their dead are safe. My work is done here.
Terrible shame, that. Seems we have a killer on the loose here in Windhelm.
Thank you, dear. It must be nice to get out of the hall every now and then.
Thank you! I don't have much, but I can give you some coin for the trouble.
Thank you. When I have the time, I'll try to think of how best to use this.
That letter ought to convince Camilla to never speak to Faendal ever again.
That priest of Mara who came here before you says the Divines will cure us.
The ancients built many of the fortresses that dot the landscape of Skyrim.
The blessings of the mine have been many, but I have no mate to share them.
The Council will be informed of this. They will find out what you're up to.
The crucial nature is pure apparent. Mundane sight traded for another sort.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.
The goddess smiles at your efforts, child. The dawn shines bright upon you.
The good mine is closed and the other mine has no ore. Gods have cursed me.
The Jarl has appointed me to be your housecarl. It's an honor to serve you.
The mages don't let us go in the College. They said it's not safe in there.
The milk drinkers in this town wouldn't last five minutes in a real battle.
The notion that the Nightingales are a fictive group has long since passed.
The quarters are up here. Just pick a bed and fall in it when you're tired.
The Thalmor came seeking answers as well, unaware they will be his undoing.
The thought of paying a dowry to that, that... Stormcloak turns my stomach.
The tribe may yet survive, but only if you are willing to do what is right.
The Twilight has foreseen all of this. Everything will be revealed in time.
The way is dangerous, and the gate will not open. You shall not gain entry!
Then the die is cast, and once again my blade will taste Nightingale blood!
Then when you have the ring, you pickpocket Brand-Shei and leave it behind.
There's much more to worry about in life then a bit of a temper, my friend.
They are. Except the gem is always consumed. They're frail. Except for one.
They owe our organization some serious coin and they've decided not to pay.
They say... well, they say he murdered someone. Something to do with Svidi.
They will become stronger for it. And you... You have proven your strength.
They'd stop at nothing to take your last bit of food if that's all you had.
They're my puppets. I have their [QUOTE]king[QUOTE] rotting in Cidhna Mine.
This information needs to go straight to the steward. He'll listen to you. 
This isn't an order of cowards. I'll find someone more agreeable, I'm sure.
This looks like the way out! I was starting to wonder if we'd ever make it.
This one is honored by your friendship. I hope this gift does honor to you.
To receive the touch of Mara, you must first act as her hands in the world.
Too bad we can't read these carvings.  Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?
Turns out who runs Winterhold doesn't change much. Can't say I'm surprised.
Unless you're here to sell that weapon of yours, why don't you put it away.
Until you get back into the Guild's graces, we have nothing to speak about.
Use your key on the vault, Delvin. We'll open it up and find out the truth.
Various shady types I've never seen before. I'd watch my back if I was you.
Very good. I'll see that this is put towards getting things back to normal.
Walk always in shadows, so that you will see your foes before they see you.
We consider even sitting down to talk with these rebels more than generous.
We control every piece of this city. The people should be calling us kings.
We did this in the name of Mephala, whom I used to quite fervently worship.
We have no need to negotiate when the rebels are so clearly losing the war.
We must hasten to Riften before Mercer can do any more damage to the Guild.
We'll stay here. Get back to the College and let them know what's going on.
We're fighting because Skyrim needs heroes, and there's no one else but us.
We're taking the city. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!
We've been over this, Den. Tekla does not share your secrets with Siddgeir.
We've got small weapons as well as big. Maces, daggers, that sort of thing.
Welcome to the Bards College. I am the headmaster here. How may I help you?
Well in that case. You'll have to hand over your life as well as your coin.
Well, well. It's raw meat. Oh, my beautiful wife has told me all about you.
What about... wait. Are you? Were you the one the Greybeards were calling? 
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be meeting Malborn in Solitude.
What have I done for the gods to take me so far from my beloved Daggerfall?
What's this nonsense I've been hearing? How dare you call Bolli a deadbeat!
When we buried my husband I made offerings to all the gods... except Talos.
When you get to be my age, you don't remember why you did much of anything.
When you're ready, I'll keep the rest of your gear safe until you get back.
Who knows. Old Delvin thinks it's some kind of a curse. I think he's crazy.
Why do you even need to ask? They treat your people as bad as they do mine.
Why don't you see if Arch-Mage Aren is interested in joining me for a meal?
Windhelm will need a government quickly if we are to prevent more violence.
Wish I could learn some of that charm. I'm just good with bows, not people.
Working at the Riften Fishery is tough, but it puts some coin in my pocket.
Wow, sure is nice of ya'. Here, hang on to the key and don't let anyone in!
Yes, I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is.
Yes, yes! Did Arch-Mage Aren send you? He sent you to rescue me, didn't he?
You approach as if you know us, stranger. Who are you and what do you want?
You are weak. Sooner you realize it, the sooner we can see the back of you.
You don't seem to have the gold on you. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding?
You gave Ulfric more than he deserved. This will certainly prolong the war.
You have all fought bravely, and sacrificed much to bring us to this point.
You have returned with the gauntlets! Enter. Speak to our chief right away.
You look like you could do with a ripe apple. Or a tomato, cabbage or leek?
You might as well have some sweets. I made them for the festival after all.
You might be able to learn something from it. Keep looking, but be careful.
You need something you're not officially supposed to have, you come see me.
You see this masterwork of the Dwemer. Deep inside their greatest knowings.
You should quit working in the Eastern Mine. Leigelf's no good to work for.
You were helpful before. I have need of your help again, if you're willing.
You will enter my shrine, destroy Malkoran, and retrieve this mighty blade.
You. You should just go. I don't have enough ale to stomach talking to you.
You'd better be able to deliver, Dragonborn. I sacrificed a lot here today.
You'd do that for a stranger? I don't know what to say. Lead on, I suppose.
You'd have to be pretty desperate to want to make a home in this dank hole.
You'll have to forgive my husband's manners. He's not used to pleasantries.
You're not afraid, are you? Of animals? Come back when you find your spine.
You're part of a family now, hamshank. I trust you... you trust me. Got it?
You're right. I'll have to remember that the next time I get a shipment in.
You've brewed a truly vile poison there. I pity the beast that tastes that.
Your man Horik is wearing his old Legion armor. What should I make of that?
...but what's this? These results... They're not at all what they should be.
[QUOTE]Dragonborn[QUOTE] huh? Was it your ma or your pa that was the dragon?
[QUOTE]When misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world[QUOTE]
A ruler is entitled to luxury, don't you think? The Thalmor understand that.
Aerin tells me you might be dealing arms to the Thieves Guild. Is this true?
Ah, a student of the craft. You'll need to start by learning an enchantment.
Ah, yes. You've proven to be a real bloodhound. Well, you've sniffed me out.
Alchemy is simple. Unless, of course, you are simple. Then I can't help you.
Although now it looks like you'll be doing the sorting. Good luck with that.
Amazing, eh? To be standing at the very entrance to Sky Haven Temple itself!
And I... I can't bear to face Nocturnal after my failure to protect the Key.
And I'm busy. You help me out, and I'll help you out. That's just how it is.
And I'm sure Barbas doesn't want me to have that axe. He'd want it this way.
Any of them! Just hurry up! No time for a debate when customers are thirsty!
Are the dragons frightening your people as much as they're frightening mine?
Are you going to see him? Do tell him [QUOTE]hello[QUOTE] for me, won't you?
Arob and Gharol eye me with envy. They don't know how to please their chief.
As it turns out, it was just one. Haldyn. I've since learned more about him.
At this point, I hardly see how your advice would improve it. It's flawless.
Ay, we can get that for ya. We just finished the timber for those catapults.
Be careful, lad. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to send you.
Before I fall, you'll feel the bite of my sharp blade, as Shor's my witness.
Being old's not so bad. Daughter keeps me fed, and my working days are done.
Better to die with blade in hand than feed his hunger, hopeless in the mist.
But aren't even you the least bit nervous? After everything that's happened?
But I'm learning about magic, and that's what they do there. Shouldn't I go?
But is it safe for you to be here? We heard that Ulfric had been captured...
But it seems we both have needs, friend. Perhaps we can help each other out.
But it was hidden away. Not by the Dwarves, you see. They were already gone.
But it's hard to believe that even Balgruuf would choose Elisif over Ulfric.
But make no mistake. What we do here today, we do for Skyrim and her people.
But those who have sent you have not told you what they seek. What you seek.
But we have a headquarters of a sort now. We'll rebuild the Blades. Someday.
By calling the dragon with the Voice, he will hear you wherever he might be.
Can you believe my former husband used to give most of our gold to the poor?
Can't just throw the big logs on the fire. Got to have the little bits, too.
Come on in. The Silver-Blood Inn has plenty of strong drink and clean rooms.
Dear. You really ought to put some clothes on. You're embarrassing yourself.
Delvin, Vex... watch the Flagon. If you see Mercer, come tell me right away.
Did you hear that? Pavo was driven out of his mine. Almost everyone is dead.
Do some people look down on me? Have I made some enemies? You're damn right.
Do you have any idea how busy I am? My mixture could be burning as we speak!
Do you hear that, Tullius? The blood of the innocent cries out for weregild.
Don't know what I would have done without Pavo. Man's braver than he admits.
Don't let my brother get to you, Tekla. You're doing a fine job around here.
Don't think you can barter with me like I'm one of those damned shopkeepers.
Every now and again, we like to remind the shopkeepers that we're in charge.
Fine, I'll just save myself then. Thank you for letting me out of that cage.
Fine. Then it will be an honor to kill you for your offenses against my kin.
For this you have earned the Blessing of Kyne, and can count me as a friend.
Forgive me for saying this, brother, but I have not felt Peryite's presence.
Funny coming from a woman who's breath smells like she just kissed a draugr.
Go ahead. Take it. I'd sooner finally put this chapter of my life behind me.
Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage, too, I see. So there's that.
Good. I'd prefer using water to cool my metal, but it's what the Jarl wants.
Goodbye. And if you happen to see Mikael, tell him I was asking about him...
Grandson. He's a strong lad. His parents were at Helgen when, well you know.
Ha ha ha ha! Again! Again! Do the part where he tries to buy you some candy.
Have you lost your mind? I thought it was clear I didn't want anyone killed.
He was once a student here at the College. Now he is... something different.
He'll tell you. Just ask. You don't even need to ask. He'll tell you anyway.
He's the protector of Man, the Dragon of the North, the patron of all Nords.
Help us get through this, will you? We're throwing everything we have at it.
His killing ushered in, shall we say, a necessary change in Imperial policy.
His name's Bolund. He's the one who works the lumber mill down by the river.
Hmm. These doors seem to be the only thing left between me and the treasure.
Hmm... krosis. There is one... detail about Skuldafn I neglected to mention.
Hmph, yeah I did. That wood elf s'wit... he's a lot smarter than I expected.
How are your parents faring, Grelka? Doing better than we are I would guess.
How could people see all the graves in Falkreath and still want to make war?
I always had a feeling she liked me. More than that brute Jofthor, at least.
I am a trained killer, and once again have been given purpose. Life is good.
I am an apprentice wizard, not a pack mule! Oh very well, but make it quick.
I could forge you a warhammer that would crush a giant's head like a walnut.
I do hope you'll remain in Solitude. This city could do with some new blood.
I don't deal with any College applicants these days, so don't bother asking.
I don't know. The guards are out looking for her, now. They'll be back soon.
I don't. Go bother Kleppr at the Silver-Blood Inn, he handles the newcomers.
I feared as much. I thought it was him we saw flying east after your battle.
I fight so that all the fighting I've already done hasn't been for nothing. 
I get your point. Tell Iddra I'm sorry for being so stubborn about the coin.
I give them access to my business associates, and they keep my coffers full.
I guess all that's left is to bestow the title. What were those words again?
I have a letter here from Quintus Navale in Windhelm. He said it was urgent.
I have a necklace that would look lovely on you, or on a... special someone.
I haven't seen you before. Have I? Have we met? I'm sorry if I've forgotten.
I heard the College teaches you how to kill people with magic. Is that true?
I hope you have coin to spend, and you're not just here to gawk at my goods.
I hope you're here for friendlier reasons now... after all, I'm all paid up.
I hope you're just playing dumb. I'm the one who left the note in Ustengrav.
I just... I just know it. I can feel it in my heart. You have to believe me.
I left that old scab. Came home to Skyrim, and found this rabble of bandits.
I like to bring Grimvar down here sometimes. It reminds him how lucky he is.
I mean no offense. I am but a humble farmer, not a great wanderer, like you.
I need to make a few things clear before I accept these Legionnaires of his.
I never would have dreamed I would be getting married in the Temple of Mara.
I only hope that this isn't an ending to things, but actually the beginning.
I oversee Markarth Smelter. Worker gets out of line, I get him back in line.
I remember her. Her stance. The way she walked. A trained warrior, no doubt.
I see you but I don't see Frost. Come back when you have the horse with you.
I served in the Great War as a Legion battlemage. I've no desire to go back.
I swear, every wanderer who shows up in Whiterun looks weaker than the last.
I think there were twenty-four in all. Most people keep them as a curiosity.
I think this is yet another conversation that wouldn't make your wife happy.
I think we'll all feel better once we're back out to sea. Won't be long now.
I thought it was painfully obvious that Gulum-Ei was important to the Guild.
I want to leave my high place, to seek shelter. From what, I don't yet know.
I was wondering if you still had many associates in the shipping profession.
I will do my best to lead the tribe, but I don't know why Malacath chose me.
I wish the Legate would let us clear out of here. Place gives me the creeps.
I won't be myself for some time. I just need to get out of here and recover.
I wonder how grandma Bothela is doing. She's probably worried sick about me.
I would be honored. Beyond honored to have such a thing here at the College.
I... I don't know why I pressed the others on, convinced them to keep going.
I'd constructed a meager shrine to Mara in the antechamber where we entered.
I'd give you a bow, but it looks like you've already taken it from the rack.
I'll let them into the house and, you know, show them where everything is...
I'll need this... No, no, useless trash... where'd I put my annotated Anuad?
I'll see you at the watchtower as soon as the rest of the men have gathered.
I'm afraid that kind of thing doesn't work on Captains in the Imperial Army.
I'm Dean of Lute at the Bards College, and no, I don't give private lessons.
I'm going to put my neck on the line. We need people like you in our outfit.
I'm in the mood to ssssiiiiinnnggg! What about you, friend? Care to join me?
I'm sorry, but the children aren't up for adoption right now. You should go.
I'm sure your bride-to-be will tell you when you where the ceremony will be.
I'm to go to the temple in Markarth. I... I'll have to leave you and mother.
I'm very busy, you know. I'm the only one Kraldar can rely on to assist him.
I'm warning you. Those people are killers. You'd never last a day with them.
I've got some fresh cabbage. I'm thinking of making some apple cabbage stew.
I've heard of them, but didn't think they were real. Have you ever seen one?
I've never known Avulstein to be that convincing! Where is the little scamp?
If it wasn't for skooma, I'd already be on my way out of this horrible city.
If she still wants to marry you when you tell her you can't afford the ring.
If we had known the Nords would be so unwelcoming, we may have kept walking.
If you can arrange an end to the fighting, Dragonsreach is at your disposal.
If you desire a glimpse of our Dark Mistress, then this is what you must do.
If you want to help, ask some of these gawkers if they saw anything useful. 
If you're heading to the Blue Palace, you might want to rethink that outfit.
If you're looking for extra work, talk to Vex or Delvin. They'll fix you up.
If you're looking for opportunities to make some coin, well... I'm your man.
In fact, just about anyone who isn't a Nord is fair game for their bullying.
In the meantime, we'll continue to root them out and put them to the sword. 
In those days, dragons could still be found among the remote mountain peaks.
Initially you'll be learning from Tolfdir, one of our most esteemed Wizards.
Is that so? I'll remember that next time we're in the mine tunnels... alone.
It can't be traced back to me, can it? Was there lot's of crying? I hope so.
It was a brilliant idea, really. Mostly mine, though Gavros took the credit.
It would be easy for someone -- or something -- to sneak up on us down here.
It's crazy to still be working here. What if there's more draugr down there?
It's good to see you, too, Esbern. It's been too long, old friend. Too long.
It's got nothing to do with the coin... this is my life we're talking about.
It's not the cold of Skyrim that gets to me. It's the stink from the people.
It's strange to think that some of my own ancestors might be buried in here.
J'zargo is sure this is the end. And this was supposed to be a safe place...
Jofthor... what about him? He'll come after us and... it will be unpleasant.
Just like always -- nobody saw anything useful. The bastard's escaped again.
Just make sure you get back out of there alive with the information we need.
Keep this up and you'll be rich enough retire before you know it. Good luck.
Lady Ateia says my voice is second only to hers. But she's selling me short.
Let's hope that's the last of them. Come on, let's see what's down this way.
Lucan, we don't sell silver buckles, do we? One of the customers was asking.
Master Wulfgar will demonstrate Whirlwind Sprint. Then it will be your turn.
Maybe I should round up some men and take us a few prisoners to interrogate.
Maybe we can swap stories about our adventures over a mug of ale at the inn!
Mother, I finished cutting at the northern stand. Where do I move on to now?
My advice? Don't overthink it. Fight well and the rest takes care of itself.
My brother Dengeir can be... difficult. Take his words with a grain of salt.
My brother is... sensitive. He has trouble focusing his attention on things.
My brother Vilkas is a better talker than me. He should be around someplace.
My family's weathered its share of problems, but we don't dwell on the past.
New orders for the soldiers, Legate. Make sure they're distributed as noted.
Next time you wish to accuse someone of a crime, I suggest you obtain proof!
Next time you're looking to pester someone, make sure it's the right person!
No, I'm sorry. I'll just... I'll know it if I find it. Does that make sense?
None of our business. There's no honor to be had in the squabbling of jarls.
None of our spells were potent enough, none of our wills were strong enough.
None. It's been long enough that honestly, I don't expect to hear from them.
Not at all. It means I'm not being hounded about my progress at the College.
Not intentionally. Some hoped he would be gone forever, forever lost. Meyye.
Not without us, you aren't! I'm sure there's enough for everyone, after all.
Nothing refreshes the soul like an honest day's labor in good, tilled earth.
Now's not the time. We need to put a stop to whatever it is that's going on.
Oh gods, you've taken everything I have. Just kill me and be done with it...
Oh, Aventus Aretino. He was sent here when his mother died, but he ran away.
Oh, he was a different person. Happy, outgoing... Like anyone who's in love.
Oh, I wouldn't be able to help them. Their skills were given by the Divines.
Oh, the Hagraven feather and so on. You can throw all those out.  You see...
Oh! Well... I... I'm sorry. Yes, we have been working on something together.
Olfrid, patron of the great Clan Battle-Born, a name I'm sure you know well.
Our son Leontius moved to Old Hroldan nearly 30 years ago. I still miss him.
Out here at work, Hjorunn treats me like an equal. Better than most in town.
Please, tell me you've found the crystal. I've no wish to die in this place.
Please. Those savages are no match for us. The Jarl is just biding his time.
Really? It just so happens we've been tracking a wagon! For about a day now.
Robbery is what it is. The Silver-Bloods are trying to muscle in on my land.
See if you can't [QUOTE]convince[QUOTE] one of those innkeepers to help you.
Seen the remnants of the grove? That... well, that was me. Me and my sister.
She kissed me on the neck, and I got so cold that the fire didn't even hurt.
Skuli's father is off fighting for the Stormcloaks. I'm sure he's just fine.
So be it. The Empire at least puts the greater good above our own interests.
So few Nords have ever offered to help us, a discount is the least I can do.
So Mikael, what'll it be tonight, hmm? Something upbeat? A Breton jig maybe?
Some advice, friend. That armor won't offer much protection in a real fight.
Sorry, guess it's too rich for your blood. Come back when you find the coin.
Stubborn or not, he's the only contact we've got at the East Empire Company.
That may work for your targets, but you'll find I'm not so easily impressed.
That was crafty. I'm sure having a steward in the pocket will come in handy.
The answer is no, I tell you! Now stop pestering me with your war-mongering!
The braggarts in the Reach always claim that no prisoner escapes their mine.
The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit.
The Empire is weak, obsolete. Look at how far we've come and with so little.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.
The others do not speak. Their Voices are too powerful for you to withstand.
The poor child is probably beggin' for us to string up her murderin' father.
The Skull hungers. It yearns for memories and leaves nightmares in its wake.
The sooner we end this rebellion, the sooner I'll be able to sleep at night.
The Thalmor are our best lead. If they aren't involved, they'll know who is.
The way you walk around at home is your own business. When you're at home...
Then... there is hope! The gods have not abandoned us! We must... we must...
There's a chill in the air. Ysmir's beard, it gets colder in here every day.
These are difficult times indeed, when men stalk their brethren like beasts.
They say that these ancient Nordic burial mounds are sometimes impenetrable.
They seem to think it's at least a dozen, but I'm sure they're exaggerating.
They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force.
They'll go looking for me, and Whiterun will be the first place they search.
They're a very old order. Pre-dated the Imperial Mages Guild by quite a bit.
They've made it their mission to hunt us down, but we are hunters ourselves.
This is quite an achievement, Dragonborn. And Jarl Ulfric. Markarth is ours!
This place is worthy of some time. You go on ahead. I'll see you back there.
This won't be easy, but that's why I'm sending you. Think you can handle it?
Tough luck for you then. Come back when you have at least one of the pieces.
Try putting your hands on the altar. Maybe Mehrunes Dagon will speak to you.
Two reasons. He's rich and because we need every sword we can get right now.
Very well. I suppose I'll just curl up somewhere until this passes as usual.
Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King.
We bards record history - we do not make it. You'd do well to remember that.
We better get moving. Come here. Let me see if I can get those bindings off.
We haven't caught anyone or anything yet. It's like it knows when I'm there.
We may not be trying to kill him, but he sure seems to be trying to kill us!
We'll come back for you as soon as we've reached our goal. You have my word.
We're attacking Riften. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!
We're honest, hardworking folk here, and we don't suffer beggars or thieves.
We've all seen your little weapon. We're impressed. Now, please put it away.
We've run into a rough patch lately, but it's nothing to be concerned about.
Weeks? Longer? It feels like an age has gone by. I haven't slept in so long.
Welcome to the center of the world. Or at least my brother Erikur's world...
Well ain't that the truth of it. All right, then. Let's see what you've got!
Well aren't you a pretty thing? Should my new bride by worried? He he he he.
Well, then I'll just stay behind you a little bit, and follow along quietly.
Well. Anything to relieve the boredom. As long as it doesn't get back to me.
What makes you think I'll give that to you, if I wouldn't give you Markarth?
When Brynjolf brought you before me I could feel a sudden shift in the wind.
When I was very young, I was sent to Skingrad in Cyrodiil to study with him.
When I've made enough money, I'm going to return to Morrowind in high style.
When my husband died, I wasn't sure I could let him go. Now I don't have to.
When that time comes, you shall take his place as my emissary. What say you?
Where is he? The one who was asking about the fugitive hiding in the Ratway?
Whether you are the only Dragonborn of this age... that is not ours to know.
Why didn't you say so? Take over my post. Make sure nobody enters the Solar.
Why should we settle for half a fin when we could just take the whole whale?
Why, because I'm a Dunmer? We didn't all grow up in dwarven ruins, you know.
Wonderful! I can begin to repay your generosity immediately. Say on, friend.
Wretched Dark Elves. It's just my luck I ended up working under one of them.
Yamarz has fallen. It is now up to you to return the giant's hammer to Atub.
Yes it can. I haven't been wrong in 50 years, and I won't be wrong tomorrow.
Yes, yes. Take care of it, Proventus. Whatever it is you're talking about...
You are the only one that has been revealed thus far. That is all I can say.
You came to visit! It's so much better here with Grelod gone. Thanks to you.
You haven't heard? All of Dawnstar hasn't had a decent night's rest in days.
You know as well as I do that that we can't hand over Riften on these terms.
You may care nothing of honor, but I do. I'm not leaving without an apology.
You mentioned something like that... when you were running off with my goat!
You met the Lylvieves? Quiet family, but they're the heart of Dragon Bridge.
You will see them... wuth fadonne... my friends - Hakon, Gormlaith, Felldir.
You will. Until then, you'll taste every potion you make before you sell it.
You worry about bashing people's heads in, I'll worry about the Guild. Okay?
You wouldn't understand, Lash. Your people aren't smart enough for politics.
You'll never be in charge of this family with that attitude, loving husband.
You'll want the Bannered Mare. See Olfina, she'll keep you swimmin' in mead.
You're alive. Then I guess you haven't paid a visit to the vampire yet, hmm?
You're going to have to buy him off; it's the only way to get his attention.
You're new around here, so I'll go easy on ya. But don't get on my bad side.
You've done alchemy a great service by helping to complete Sinderion's work.
Your name's been cleared... by Thonar Silver-Blood. Consider yourself lucky.
Your path differs from most. You are being guided, pushed towards something.
Ysmir's beard! The man was always a bit odd, but I wouldn't have expected...
7,000 Steps indeed... next time they need to build it closer to the ground...
A well placed word, or a well placed dagger. Both can achieve equal purposes.
Actually, the fisherman who found me, the man I call my father gave it to me.
Ah. Uh. Of course I'm not just rising. You must have been out when I woke up.
All right, but you just watch yourself. Next time, I might not be so lenient.
All right, that's far enough. You know how this works- toll here is 100 gold.
All things are possible, my child. But I believe it is within you to succeed.
All you've got to do is find and kill one lousy chef. The clock is ticking...
And at that moment, I knew it would end with one of us at the end of a blade.
And finally, Sibbi; the worst of all of them. He's in Riften Jail for murder.
And I suppose the Cruel-Seas would be just the clan to provide ships and men?
And like always, the boy lacks any kind of spine. He'll need some convincing.
And that's exactly what the old man wanted. I'm glad we could give it to him.
And yet now, suddenly, they have chosen to contact you? Why, it's intriguing!
Aren't you wonderful! Why can't your father be more like you and your sister?
As for research... Well, a sufficient explanation will cover almost anything.
Bah. If there was a tonic that could help me, I would have found it by now...
Balgruuf, did you slip out again last night for a drink at the Bannered Mare?
Bandits are desperate men. They have nothing to lose, and they fight like it.
Barring any more interruptions, perhaps we can locate the information I need.
Be careful, lass. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to send you.
Be warned, the Jarl is in a foul mood since the Stormcloaks overran Whiterun.
Because, even after all their posturing and planning, they've made a mistake.
Believe me, it wasn't anything I ever intended to do. I just... lost control.
Besides, I'm sure your being imprisoned was all a terrible misunderstanding. 
Blasted war. I was due a new dress from Solitude, but it will never get here.
Brynjolf is needed back at the Thieves Guild to keep order while you're away.
But it is not time for rejoicing. The defiler continues to profane my temple.
But my mind and soul remain my own. I become more than either human or beast.
But there is always more to learn. I believe you are ready for the next step.
But what about the banning of Talos worship? Isn't that worth fighting about?
But when you can sniff out a vein of iron like me, it isn't too much trouble.
By transacting the Oath with Nocturnal, you're entering into a business deal.
Call it whatever you like, General. The man's going to try to take Whiterun. 
Collect the Rueful Axe from Rimerock Burrow, and I believe we'll have a deal.
Come now, dear husband. You above all people should know what I'm capable of.
Come see me in Windhelm when all this is over, and I'll find a place for you.
Delvin, that last shipment we heisted on the Cyrodiil frontier was worthless!
Did I ever tell you about the day when Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger?
Did you see those guards? Get out of line, and you'll have them to deal with.
Didn't you just see that woman getting attacked in front of us? We're closed.
Do yourself a favor and don't have children. They're good for nothing at all.
Don't you think I know that? But these commands come straight from Cyrodiil. 
Even though the Phial was damaged, I still think your efforts deserve reward.
Fair? This is war, soldier. War's about winning, not being fair to the enemy.
Far have I traveled to bring you these fine goods. Come and see what I offer.
Father never trusted Beem. I always thought he was just being overprotective.
Father says I'm too young to train with a sword, so I practice with my fists!
Find out what's happening in the Hall of the Dead. Arkay will watch over you.
Foolish old woman! You know nothing! Nothing of our struggles, our suffering!
Get over to our camp in the Pale. It's time we bring them back into the fold.
Get over to our camp in the Reach. They need every able body they can muster.
Give him time. In a couple years, he'll be the age you were when you started!
Gods, you'd better have something good up your sleeve. I've got nothing left.
Good work. A simple job, but it keeps the coin rolling in. Here's your share.
Good. We'll take a short break, then move on to wide-area destruction spells.
Good. You're clearly better suited than I am to carry out such a menial task.
Gorm thinks I'm mad. He doesn't say it, but I know he thinks it. Is he right?
Greed? Jealousy? Spite? Who can say what drove her to such an iniquitous act.
He is our leader. He surpasses us all in his mastery of the Way of the Voice.
He might find something good in there. One man's trash is another's treasure.
He surrendered pretty meekly, too. So much for his death-or-glory reputation.
He turned to drinking, and what's left of him is what you see here every day.
He was a wonderful man, and he loved us very much. I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Here, take this and don't mention a word of this to anyone, especially Svana!
Hey, jailor! What I don't understand is why you're siding with the Imperials.
Hmph. Hadn't expected you had it in you. Here. Take this for a job well done.
I advise Igmund the same way I advised his father. Caution, caution, caution.
I agree. It'll be nice to get back the respect we lost in the last few years.
I am a Thalmor Justiciar on important business that you are interfering with.
I assume you have proof? Can't go making accusations like that without proof.
I believe the Legate gave you an order. I expect you to follow it. Dismissed.
I believe you know what needs to be done. Something about putting out a fire?
I caught a glimpse of that captured dragon. It's.. beautiful. In its own way.
I don't know if the war is Arkay's will or man's, but it's none of my doings.
I don't like making him angry, but there is some work for you if you want it.
I escaped fighting in Cyrodiil only to have it track me down again in Skyrim.
I find that highly unlikely... but the court will love it. I'm writing it in.
I grow tired of debating this. If Miss Salma insists on this folly, so be it.
I had no choice! It was the only way to make sure that monster never escaped!
I hadn't asked you because I was afraid you'd say no. I appreciate your help.
I have a... friend, let's say, who's interested in a staff. A particular one.
I have need of a warrior. Only the most ruthless, cunning, and agile will do.
I know this place looks horrible -- please don't hold it against the Company.
I know you're drunk as usual, but that's no excuse for insulting our hostess.
I know! I know! I received the news not moments ago! Ha ha! This is glorious!
I love when you spin that yarn. Gets better every time you add something new.
I need you to eliminate an old woman named Agnis, a servant in Fort Greymoor.
I thank you all again for making this the best wedding a woman could ask for.
I thought I made it clear that this sort of behavior is totally unacceptable.
I understand if you need some time to prepare. Let me know when you're ready.
I work in the forge and the mines. Mother says it pleases her and our people.
I wouldn't mind teaching the ways of the pickpocket... if the gold was right.
I'd be a fool to turn down a chance of marrying you. I'm game if you're game!
I'd give my eye teeth if it meant getting those damn spiders out of the mine!
I'll consider the offer, but I'll have to discuss it with the other caravans.
I'll look around the house and if I find it, I'll bring it to you right away.
I'll not stand idly by while a dragon burns my hold and slaughters my people!
I'll speak to Ulfric soon, but I make no promises that I can change his mind.
I'm no one special, just a miner who swings a pickaxe for his drinking money.
I'm not proud, but I will stay back with Vilkas. Give my regards to Ysgramor.
I'm so glad we got to have it. I thought for sure Elisif would never consent.
I'm sorry -- she was very dear to me, and it's rather painful to think about.
I'm warning you, when I get my heart set on something I'm not easily put off.
I'm willing to let the Dragonborn be the judge of the fairness of my request.
I've been tending to the warriors of Jorrvaskr for as long as I can remember.
I've never seen Mjoll this upset about anything. The city really gets to her.
I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.
If anyone sneaks up on us, I'll smell them coming. Or I might not. We'll see.
If I can't get you something, I'm sure my wife will bellow at me until I can.
If that's what you want. Come find me at the College if you change your mind.
If Ulfric's making a move for Whiterun, then we need to be there to stop him.
If we can just find out what this Dragonrend Shout is, you may have a chance.
If you can Shout, you need to go see the Greybeards. They'll know what to do.
If you could speak to him. Draw out the truth. I would be immensely grateful.
If you don't mind, my patrons would appreciate it if you put the weapon away.
If you want to go out to Whiterun and burn that meadery down, go right ahead.
If you've got the raw materials, you can use the forge to make something new.
Innocent? So was I, for the first one. The other murders were all me, though.
It ain't true what they say about you and... and the Dark Brotherhood? Is it?
It was my sister, Lilija. She served as a Battle Maiden with the Stormcloaks.
It's bad enough my brother is harping on me to pick one. Don't you start too.
It's good to see you. If you need my help again, it's the same fee as always.
It's just... aren't you worried about the Forsworn? Maybe it's not safe here.
It's not that simple, Igmund. There are reports of Forsworn here in the city.
Jarl decided I was too much of a problem. Threw me in here with the Forsworn.
Just ask him where he was on the 30th of Frostfall. He'll know what it means.
Just promise me when you get some more in, I'll have the first crack at them.
Kjeld speaks for Kynesgrove. Anyone who says otherwise is aching for a fight.
Kodlak's final teaching. I think he was right about beastblood and Sovngarde.
Kraldar has big plans for Winterhold. We'd be better off if he was in charge.
Left Hand Mine deals with iron, the perfect metal to dig with a war going on.
Let's just say I'm a firm believer in an eye for an eye and leave it at that.
Look, I don't like wasting my time. Come back when you decide to get serious.
Luckily, I had made some friends with the clan who immediately sided with me.
Markarth is my city. You have no right looking into my business. Now get out.
Maybe, but they wouldn't taste as good as a loaf of fresh-baked pumpernickel.
Me? I'm Burguk's brother. I came back after serving many years in the Legion.
Meat and mead must ever make way for the clash of steel - the song of battle.
Men, women, children, no one was spared my wrath. I destroyed whole villages.
Mikael is quite the songbird. Maybe he's the reason you're here all the time.
Mind you don't forget to sweep up, Julienne. The floor's looking a bit dusty.
Most who arrive here do so because they have heard of the College beforehand.
Much better. Thanks, friend. I wouldn't have lasted much longer without that.
My experiments continue to go well thanks to you. How can I return the favor?
Never knew a place could be so ancient. I bet it's over a thousand years old.
Never thought I'd get married under a Nord god. But with you, it feels right.
No time to talk now, my friend. No time. Out mistress needs tending. Keeping.
No. In fact, the Tong were quite the bitter rivals with the Dark Brotherhood.
None, however, exactly match the markings or distribution of Skyrim's stones.
Not at all. That was as much a test of your abilities as it was your resolve.
Now let's just, you know, try to forget any of this ever happened. All right?
Now move quickly. The girl must be brought to the temple as soon as possible.
Now this is real guard duty. Just throw them in the mine and be done with it.
Now you're threatening me? What in the name of the Divines is wrong with you?
Of course you are! I prayed, and you came, and now you'll accept my contract!
Oh Hroggar, you know I'm always hungry. Don't worry, I'll eat when I need to.
Oh you poor thing! Come by the temple and my husband and I will keep you fed.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm certain Bolli would be happy to lend you a few septims.
Oh, no. Many were killed, of course. But many survived into historical times.
Oh, so you're trying to play both sides, is that it? What do you really want?
Oh, thank you so much! It's wonderful to have someone around who understands.
Oh... well... of course they'd disavow all knowledge... spies are everywhere.
Paarthurnax? That name is familiar... the legendary leader of the Greybeards?
Pay dear old Sarthis a visit and tell him Maven sends her regards, would you?
Perhaps we can go another few decades without a disaster. That would be nice.
Please, I need your help and there isn't anyone I can trust here in the city.
Probably best if you avoid it for now... it didn't seem to do Reyda any good.
Proventus, what do you make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack Whiterun...
Really? Good. Was there a lot of screaming? Never mind. I don't want to know.
Remember, this is where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return.
Rules, is it, Tsavani? I didn't realize that eating Moon Sugar was permitted.
See if you can get it open with some picks. We'll need everything we can get.
Shop at Belethor's for the best prices and selection. He pays me to say that.
Sigh. Very well. You're lucky Maramal has placed me in a very forgiving mood.
Sigh... fine, take whatever you want, so long as you help me get rid of Vals.
Sigrid! Love of my life! When you get a spare moment, I could use some water.
Since nobody's trying to kill me just now, maybe we should rest for a minute.
Skjor has been a warrior for a long time. You would be wise to listen to him.
Snow falls. Why worry where it goes? M'aiq thinks the snowflakes are pretty. 
So far he's managed to stay out of the war. I'm afraid it can't last, though.
Some people don't think I'm smart. Those people get my fist. But you, I like.
Sorry, outlander, but this old Orc cannot help you. Burguk is the chief here.
Stand fast! His strength is failing! Once more, and his might will be broken!
Steady now. The Legion has faced down worse than a few dusty old bonewalkers.
Take your time then. It isn't as though the Greybeards are going to complain.
Talk to Babette about potions. She's the creepy little girl - can't miss her.
Tarry not too long - the land of the dead is not meant for mortals to linger.
Tell you what. I'll give you a share right now if you forget the whole thing.
Thank you. Honor dictates something in return. I hope you find this pleasing.
Thank you. I was afraid I'd have to figure out some way to do this on my own.
Thanks. I guess this was the least you could do after what happened to Lucan.
That drum has been in half a dozen famous battles. It's a priceless artifact.
That would be Jarl Igmund. Young for a ruler of a Hold, especially the Reach.
That's just how it is with families. When we're chiefs, you'll see how it is.
The boy has a nugget of truth, but the reality is more complicated than that.
The crown must be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes open.
The effects have already been felt. The Icerunner has failed to dock on time.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.
The snowberries up in Winterhold have lowered themselves to ask for our help.
Then you will feel - know - Dragonrend, in the power of its first expression.
There are but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe. 
There are no heroes in this war. No winners to be had and no real conclusion.
There is no progress without sacrifice. No wheat without threshing the chaff.
There something I can do for you? Perhaps direct you to the nearest prison...
There's a new guard nosing around the meadery. Can you do something about it?
These earthen passages do not agree with me. I already miss the wind and sky.
They haven't been by the Bunkhouse, but I'm certain they will. How about you?
They say the Dragonborn can Shout without any training. Like Talos himself...
They seem less intelligent each time you raise them, if that's even possible.
This one wonders - do you have no clothes, or just like the feel of the wind?
This person, whomever he or she may be, must be punished for their treachery.
This temple is dedicated to Mara, and the light of love she shines on us all.
Time's wasting and Mercer's still out there. Let's get this show on the road.
To be sure, my lord, I am not skilled in the arts of war or military tactics.
Torygg had some martial training, of course, but it mattered little that day.
Trapping a dragon in Dragonsreach. Damn clever idea you had, I have to admit.
Trust you saw the house that burned down. Peculiar bit of business, that was.
Ulfric and General Tullius are both just waiting for me to make a wrong move.
Umm... So, the business is done. This is the last we'll talk about it, right?
Urog and I still hunt a lot, so it's not like I'm cooped up in the longhouse.
Used to be twice as many miners working here before all this trouble started.
Vignar and I have our hands full. It's no small task, running an entire hold.
Wait a moment... do I detect a hint of genuine avarice from this noble thief?
We already have people that do that and they make quite a bit of coin for it.
We get Riften back. Now we'll see if there's anything behind your fine words.
We should keep moving. Come here. Let me see if I can get those bindings off.
We won't give up this port to the Imperials without a fight, don't you worry.
We've got all the miners we need, so I hope you're not here looking for work.
We've got half of Skyrim back under our wing and the coin's startin' to flow.
We've heard rumors of death and... and fire from the skies. But no real news.
Well I really would like to make sure I've corrected what happened last time.
Well, all of the previous Apprentices have been accounted for, thanks to you.
Well, aren't you the handsome one. You and I should spend some time together.
Well, as you know, the Guild's growing and things are looking up around here.
Well, can't say exactly where the mold is, but something does spring to mind.
Well, I've been working on something. An improvement on the Ebonyflesh spell.
Well, it's been described as an accident. I can't imagine it was intentional.
Well, yes. Two of them. But you're reaching the end of what I have available.
Whatever is affecting the Nightingale Sentinels is starting to affect me too.
Whether you know it or not, Nocturnal dictates how well we perform as rogues.
Why do they call it Left Hand Mine? Can the miners use their right hands too?
Would it be foolish to stop for a while and light a fire? I suppose it would.
Yeah, but don't say anything about it to Froki. I don't think he understands.
Yeah, funny thing about that. The price was a hundred higher than I expected.
Yes sir, Professor Gemane! It's a war epic about Hoag Merkiller's last stand!
Yes! How'd you get this? Never mind, here. It's not much, but its something. 
Yes. Congratulations, you are now a full-fledged member of the Bards College.
You and I, we're the only people in Skyrim worth loving. That's what I think.
You did the job and you did it clean; that's all we ever ask. Enjoy the gold.
You do not know of Malacath? He is the keeper of oaths, the master of curses.
You handled yourself pretty well back at Japhet's Folly. We'll remember that.
You have your orders. Rendezvous with the rest of the men outside Korvanjund.
You know Winterhold used to be the seat of power in Skyrim? Now it's a shell.
You mean, aside from wanting to kill every Blade they can lay their hands on?
You merely transacted the Oath; signed the unwritten contract with Nocturnal.
You might be a guest in Dragonsreach, but you're starting to try my patience.
You should focus on honing your Voice, and soon your path will be made clear.
You should stop by my farm if you get a chance. See what life's really about.
You shouldn't be here, unless you've decided to bring Paarthurnax to justice.
You'll want to be careful travelin' at night. The marsh is a dangerous place.
You're a traitor. You left us to die and then ran before the Miasma took you.
You're sweet. I'm just not ready for that sort of thing right now. I'm sorry.
You're the only one that can kill a dragon permanently by devouring its soul.
You've embarrassed the temple and spat in the face of love. What do you want?
Your new piece will enhance your skill beyond that of the original. Trust me.
...Oooh... Cicero wants some Skyforge Steel! Sharp sharp, for easy stabbing...

[QUOTE]Disappointed[QUOTE] is not the word I would choose, Colette. Excuse me.
A man who feels no fear has no heart. I know fear. But it does not control me.
A sale's a sale but I have to know... why are you buying something for Noster?
A word of warning though... I don't want any of them killed. Bad for business.
After what you just experienced, you are not amazed? I am at a loss for words.
Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice, but it is written here in this scroll.
All I can tell you for now is that he's abused his authority as a Nightingale.
All right, all right. Have it your way. Tell Octieve to forget about the debt.
Alva told me later that she never showed up. I never got to tell her good bye.
An investment, is it? Alright, I'm sure I can put the extra money to good use.
And I have no more time for talking. Go speak with Kesh if you are so curious.
And so you fulfilled your destiny, which you once said you did not believe in.
And take this. It's blessed with the old magicks. Something to remember me by.
And then I told her about the vampires and how much they would pay me for her.
And what of your latest, Arnbjorn. Something about a Khajiit? Merchant was it?
Approach Master Borri and he will gift you his knowledge of [QUOTE]Nah.[QUOTE]
Are you a sellsword? I don't like your kind. No honor. No loyalty. Unreliable.
Are you new around here? You should go to the inn if you need a place to stay.
At least you remembered to bring me the information I requested. Give me that.
Back to work, I guess. There's never a shortage of dung to shovel around here.
Bandits harass the caravans at every step, but Khajiit usually scare them off.
Bunch of distractions, if you ask me. They just interrupt the rest of my work.
But again, we see that the natural order will be restored, one way or another.
But first we need to get our hands on some rebel orders to make the forgeries.
But I've no doubt he'll prove loyal to the Empire in the end. He's no traitor.
By all I hold sacred... that's a Shout! Like the Graybeards on their mountain!
By defeating Ulfric at Whiterun we have solidified the allegiance of the Jarl.
By Shor's command we curb our wrath, so we feast and sing, til the final doom.
Can you help me? He's in the tomb doing Gods know what with my dead relatives.
Can't believe Ulfric's gone. If not for Hermir, I'd have left the city by now.
Careful! I wouldn't do that again unless you know for sure it's going to open.
Caught a case of Rockjoint, once. Bothela at the Hag's Cure fixed me right up.
Certainly. I'll be sure to bring some back for you the next time I go hunting.
Cicero can talk for a moment. Just a moment. Then Mother must be... tended to.
Come by Belethor's shop, at the market. I'm sure we've got something you need.
Come now, don't be shy. You haven't come this far just to stand there gawking.
Come now. Whatever the problem, we can talk about it like civilized folk. Hmm?
DO NOT RECORD - used as silent blocker for inappropriate dialogue in Sovngarde
Do you mind? I'm busy doing the fishstick. It's a very delicate state of mind!
Don't bother with that. Lost the key ages ago. Poor fellow screamed for weeks.
Don't know what the Redguards see in books, but this will make my Seren happy.
Don't know. He just said he needed to talk to you before you do anything else.
Don't let this innocent-looking flute fool you, for this is the Dancer's Pipe.
Eh... You see... I've been thinking about Faleen quite a bit. You know Faleen?
Eirid says the mages at the College are nice people, but you said they're bad.
Esbern's probably right. Try using your blood on the carved seal on the floor.
Excuse my disorganization, but I'm in the middle of some delicate experiments.
Fair faces and fine food are well and good, but honesty is rarely so pleasing.
Fine. I offered you a reward. You'll get the freedom your kind enjoys so much.
First of all, there's someone in particular I'd like to win over to our cause.
For the man who knows how to make money, war can be a most profitable venture.
For thirty years, I served the Legion as a commander. Fought in the Great War.
Forgive me if I don't appear relieved... this temple has taken its toll on me.
Gallus had his wealth and he had you. All he had to do was look the other way.
Go, take care of the Muiri contract. There will be plenty more, I promise you.
Goldenglow Estate provided a huge payout for us before Aringoth locked us out.
Good luck on your travels. May Kynareth's wind carry only the sweetest scents.
Good. Kleppr will pay you as soon as you arrive with the letter. Here you are.
Good. Wait until I start the distraction and then show me what you're made of.
Grelod ain't going to like some stranger just hangin' around. Not that I care.
Haldyn? I've heard of the man, but never guess he'd join up with some pirates.
Have you talked to Nazir? He's sure to have some additional contracts for you.
He told me to make sure you didn't get in the way. That's all I know, I swear!
Hello, dear. I haven't been drinking too much, if that's what you're thinking.
I am glad you believe that. At least it will continue to exist. Grik los lein.
I am not. I have no more taste for Thalmor wine than I do for Thalmor company.
I am! I am! But not just my mother. Our mother, hmm? The Night Mother! Oh yes!
I dislike lurking near dwarven cities. It's like their ghosts are watching us.
I don't know about this Dragonborn business, but I'm sure glad you're with us.
I don't know what it's doing up there, but I'm not waiting around to find out!
I don't know what you're talking about. But if I were you, I'd hold my tongue.
I don't know. Maybe because it makes the mead taste that much better at night.
I forget that you've never seen it. Beneath the Skyforge, where Eorlund works.
I give special rates to members of the Thieves Guild. Show me what you've got.
I had a look at that boneyard the other day, Vantus. The one to the Northwest.
I hardly noticed you were gone. Got your share of the spoils right here, boss.
I hope Ulfric will come to his senses. But I fear he's in too far to stop now.
I just said that to make the poor guy feel better. I'm pretty sure she's dead.
I keep coming out here thinking I'll see what others see in this... frivolity.
I know, I know. My head's in the clouds again. Just... forget I said anything.
I lead the Justiciars. We are charged with enforcing the ban on Talos worship.
I learned to forge when I was a pup, then I joined the Legion and mastered it.
I lost my family years ago. Truth is, I don't really know what keeps me going.
I married Thonar for the money, and I'm not the least bit ashamed to admit it.
I need you to find the Arch-Mage, and I need you to do it quickly. Get moving!
I promise you, all your questions will be answered. You just have to trust me.
I suggest you mind your own business and return to whatever it is you do here.
I think the dragons are here to test us, and make sure we're still true Nords.
I thought Enmon and Mean had a little girl, but I haven't seen her in a while.
I traveled far and wide when I was younger. Glad to have settled down finally.
I trust you've applied the appropriate pressure in order to change their mind?
I wanted to thank you again for the mince pie you sent over. It was delicious.
I wouldn't complain if we could string together a few sunny days now and then.
I'd rather fight bandits than draugr. At least bandits know when to stay dead.
I'd say you're either brave or stupid, but I can already tell which one it is.
I'll be damned if I let this rabble take my city without raising my own sword.
I'll call upon my suppliers this very evening and arrange to double my orders.
I'll introduce you to Farengar. He can be a bit... difficult. Mages. You know.
I'll tell you why you won't tell me. Because you were absolutely right not to.
I'm sure you've noticed that Winterhold isn't exactly overflowing with people.
I've got all sorts of weapons for the discerning marksman. What can I get you?
I've known her long enough to appreciate her excellent taste in food and wine.
If I cared for your opinion on our affairs, I'd ask. Now, if you'll excuse me.
If you ever need something, especially something hard to come by, let me know.
If you're headed up to the monastery, watch your step... it's a long way down.
If you're in the area and you ever need anything fenced, you just let me know.
In his quarters, with that Thalmor, Ancano. Something urgent, it sounded like.
In the Dark Brotherhood, I found acceptance, love, and my life's true purpose.
Indeed. Speak with me when the box has been opened, and all shall be revealed.
Irgnir, get a hold of yourself. They're just dreams. Please tell her, Erandur.
Is he with you, Delphine? If so, I advise you to tell him to watch his tongue.
Is it still worth it? When do you decide enough is enough, and just walk away?
Is it true you chased a thief from your home? I overheard Aerin mentioning it.
Is that a dwarven city? I've never seen a dwarf, ever. Don't think anyone has.
Isn't it obvious? Why, the wonderful weather and hospitable people, of course!
It brings me joy to hear that, but what possessed you to say that so suddenly?
It is a gift. Anyone who believes otherwise does not and cannot understand it.
It is good to finally be around mages who may be able to keep up with J'zargo.
It will work if we can pull Hran's men from the south. And find a bit of luck.
It's amazing this place is so well preserved. There isn't even a hint of rust.
It's my boy Sven you need to listen to. He sings at the inn, most every night.
It's the Key, Brynjolf. In his hands, there's no telling what he's capable of.
J'zargo hoped there might be one who could keep pace with his accomplishments.
Jorgen and I both work hard, all the time. Morthal is important to both of us.
Keep as quiet as you can. The Falmer may be blind, but they can still hear us.
Khajiit are not welcome in the cities, so we make our camps outside the walls.
Let me guess - you need a drink. It's the Silver-Blood Inn you're looking for.
Let's hope you can show that his heart was not deceived. Good luck, my friend.
Look, I want you to have this. I know it isn't much, but it's important to me.
Money's been tight since the mill burned down. My wife won't let me forget it.
My father is more generous than he lets on. Gives me plenty of spending money.
Need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar.
Never mind, I don't care. I'm just glad I don't gotta' work for Maven anymore.
New here too, eh? It's good to see another Nord. I feared I'd be the only one.
No doubt those Greybeards up at High Hrothgar will talk your ear off about it.
No, don't go! You may not be one of our tribe, but you are an Orc nonetheless!
No. Even after Istlod died, the moot voted to make Torygg High King of Skyrim.
No. It's some sort of crazy contraption Mercer commissioned for quick escapes.
Nonsense. You and your friend are welcome to stay here as long as you need to.
Not for all the gold in Skyrim would I spend my life working in these tunnels.
Not too bad. A few of the guests from the upcoming wedding have placed orders.
Now that I think on it, I did hear something rather interesting the other day.
Now we're deep in debt, penniless and about to lose our sole source of income.
Now you're sounding as crazy as the cat. Be going on about the Pale Lady next.
Obeying the Night Mother. You being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense.
Of course, I can't let you leave here alive. Wouldn't want anyone finding out.
Of course! Nine is the most basic of magical principles. Oh, how stupid of me.
Oh, I couldn't. Goes right through me. Besides, I have so many things to do...
Oh, I think I'll be fine. We seem to have eliminated the most pressing threat.
Or if you're feeling lucky, you can take this bow. Might take her by surprise.
Pardon me, but do I detect a case of the Rattles? I've got something for that.
Pardon. I saw you toss a piece of armor. You wouldn't mind if I take it, then?
Press only middle button! Clever trick, yes? Nobody ever thinks of the middle.
Recently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to Dawnstar.
Reputation, mostly. A lot of Khajiit turn to smuggling and thievery to get by.
Rexus will now give you two items which must be passed along to your superior.
Safety? Don't I have you to handle the town's safety? What is this about, Jod?
Shahvee knows the dock doesn't look nice, but fresh air is good for the gills.
She might find something good in there. One man's trash is another's treasure.
Shut up or they'll kill us, you idiot! Once they're gone I'll pick the lock...
Sibbi and I were to be married. We were supposed to be happy together forever.
Sir, I'm going to need some better equipment if you want me plowing the frost.
So I've heard. Thanks to you, this should be the last time they forget to pay.
So we're just supposed to sit here while Arvel runs off with that golden claw?
So you like to hurt people, huh? The town is still talking about what you did.
Some come to buy, but others come to steal. Khajiit shows no mercy to thieves.
Sometimes I wonder if my aunts are right about my father -- he does seem weak.
Sometimes I wonder if the gods have abandoned us... as we have abandoned them.
Spirits! Ghosts! I am cursed, haunted, and I can do nothing. Can you fix that?
Stormcloaks won't have it though. Too busy keeping the Imperial forces at bay.
Survive, and you are worthy. This is the test put before you. Will you accept?
Take your question to the College of Winterhold. They may be able to help you.
Thank you again. If I require anything else, I shall be sure and let you know.
Thank you. He can be a bit difficult, but I'm sure he'll appreciate your help.
That dark elf wants to go on ahead, let him. Better than us risking our necks.
That would be good! I could use it to smash other rocks. Easier to mine, then.
The answer ain't gonna be any different the next time. Arrogant elven bastard.
The Augur? Really? Well, it's certainly not my place to say anything about it.
The catch is you can't kill anyone who lives there or you forfeit the payment.
The College is an asset to Skyrim, even if it goes unnoticed or unappreciated.
The College of Winterhold has been a fixture in Skyrim for thousands of years.
The Companions can help protect the city, and the Emperor will be in our debt.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.
The grindstone will improve your weapons. Use the table to improve your armor.
The impertinence! You never would have talked to me like that when I was Jarl.
The inns at Dragonbridge and Solitude are frequent stops for Imperial runners.
The master has gone but Dervenin will find him. Dervenin should not have gone.
The Nightgate and Candlehearth inns are frequent stops for Stormcloak runners.
The old tales tell of Dragonborn heroes who slew dragons and took their power.
The second is to change Arn's name in the prison registry to his new identity.
The Thalmor hunted us down, remember? It wasn't exactly great for recruitment.
The timid warrior and the sly Khajiit. Must have been one or the other, right?
Then the Forsworn will be where they belong. In the mines, bringing us wealth.
Then you're talking to the wrong man. You want that elf in the keep. Calcelmo.
This circlet once proved invaluable to me. I hope it can be of use to you now.
This council was your idea, eh? So tell us, what do you think Riften is worth?
This is a great service you've done for me, Harbinger. I will not soon forget.
This is quite an achievement, Dragonborn. And General Tullius. Riften is ours!
This is the only thing I've ever found. I think it's better off in your hands.
This is the Silver-Blood Inn. I'll let you figure out who owns it by yourself.
This is the Thieves Guild, genius. How do you think? With gold. A lot of gold.
This is what it's come to. No one seems to care what they've done to our home.
This is... more than I could have hoped for. Have you really done this for me?
This place is already starting to feel like home. Must be all the bloodstains.
To harness it is to know. The fundaments. The Dwemer lockbox hides it from me.
Torbjorn wants the shipping operations to bring in cash, and I make it happen.
Traitor? Me? Silly assassin. So confused, so confused... and they say I'm mad!
Try not to judge Falkreath too harshly, visitor - the war has been hard on us.
Ulfric called him out as a traitor to Skyrim, and killed him in single combat.
Ulfric the Pretender wants that crown, but we're not going to let him have it.
Unfortunately for you, we don't allow the uninitiated into the inner sanctum. 
Wait, so you think we'll be able to harvest some of the sacred trees up there?
Wait. General, you don't intend to just hand over Markarth to that... traitor!
Watch out for the hot steam vents down here. They'll burn you worse than fire.
We cannot carry on this way! You know we are doomed if we do not do something!
We have a chance to destroy the Dark Brotherhood, forever. It's all up to you.
We have to go through town and across the bridge to get to Bleak Falls Barrow.
We must reach the inner sanctum and destroy it. Come, there's no time to lose.
We only trade during the day, outlander. At night, most rest in the longhouse.
We served our time in the Legion. Now we're just trying to make it day to day.
We tunneled into an old Nordic crypt. The whole place is crawling with draugr.
We'll be sending generous resources to Ulfric. As much as the Reach can bleed.
We're taking the capital. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!
Well, I'm going to look around some more. See what the old Blades left for us.
Well, probably not like these. The ones in there are all still walking around.
Well, we had one go missing from the Pawned Prawn, and I was just wondering...
Well, yes. This is rather embarrassing, but it seems I've misplaced something.
What did you do to me? What am I made of? Air? Shadow? Oh, this is not good...
What good is a court mage if she refuses to fight? Where's your sense of duty?
What're you doing here, Redguard? You a sellsword? A sailor from Stros M'kai? 
What's left of the Honningbrew has been dumped into the sewers. Good riddance.
Wherever the Daedra hide, the Vigil of Stendarr will cast them into the light.
While I feel Ulfric's cause is just, my concern is for the people of The Rift.
Whiterun is a such beautiful city. Have you ever seen the likes of this place?
Who in their right mind would be stupid enough to pay you to steal from Maven?
Who was kin to both wyrm, and the races of man, with a power to rival the sun!
Why are we even going to a wedding at this far flung end of the Empire anyway?
Why should I want anything? Why can't I simply be sociable with my colleagues?
Will she acknowledge that it is we Nord's who will determine Skyrim's future? 
With a single snap of her fingers, we could have a legion here in a fortnight.
With a wife like Fridrika and a son like Horm, I'm the luckiest man in Skyrim.
With all due respect, Arch-Mage, I'm not in a position to just give this away.
Worse. The loss of shipments from Forsworn attacks are really hitting us hard.
Wrong or right, the Mythic Dawn changed Tamriel's history. They deserve study.
Yeah, these Khajiit make a living traveling the roads and selling their wares.
Yes, child. Nana Ildene has taken care of the Silver-Bloods for many years....
Yes, I agree with you. Have you heard any news from the other parts of Skyrim?
Yes. That's why we need to prepare ourselves and meet Mercer on equal footing.
You are banished! Alduin, we shout you out from all our endings unto the last!
You are the Listener! You are the Listener! I have served mother well, I have!
You aren't fooling me. Trusted witnesses have seen you commit several murders.
You can't kick me out of here. You want me gone, you're gonna have to kill me.
You know as well as I do that that we can't hand over Markarth on these terms.
You know what's wrong with Skyrim these days? Everyone is obsessed with death.
You know, I can still sell you some potions and such, or train you in alchemy.
You must trust in the rightness of your cause, and the strength of your Voice.
You need to be careful in this city. Never know who you can trust, these days.
You shall find this: Knowledge will corrupt. It will destroy. It will consume.
You want to talk to the King in Rags? Fine. But first you got to pay the toll.
You'd better hope the war's over by then. The Stormcloaks would eat you alive!
You'll hear some of the brighter faces around here talk about honor and glory.
You'll pay off your debt to the Reach. Just work and you'll earn your freedom.
You're different, aren't you? Not like anyone else. Not in Morthal, or Skyrim.
You're making people a bit nervous. Should consider putting that weapon away. 
You're the one who's coming to Japhet's Folly with us, right? You ready to go?
You've done it now, whelp. You broke the rules and now you're knee deep in it.
You've had more than enough. Besides, you still haven't paid for the last one.
...once was a woman, as fair as an evenin', of springtime in old Stros M'Kai...

A fair point... Well, you've come to the right place, then. Speak with Galmar. 
A life on the river makes for weak legs, so I do a lot of walking when we dock.
About how the Divines cursed you. What horrible thing did you do to deserve it?
Ah yes. If she wants to pay the two thousand gold tariff than we'll be all set.
Ah, is there any way you'd rather spend the day than drinking Honningbrew Mead?
Ah, that's excellent news. This will be most helpful in furthering my research.
Ah, you're back. I'm hearing good things about the Guild through the grapevine.
Ahkari freed me from a prison in Cyrodiil, and now I must repay my debt to him.
Aia, please be quiet. Viarmo and I are discussing matters of national politics.
Alduin's mist is more than a snare - its shadowy gloom is his shield and cloak.
And any other abominations that prey on mortals. Vampires. Werewolves. Witches.
And besides, no Nord with a shred of honor would consider it. We're no cowards.
And here comes my first visitor. The Museum of the Mythic Dawn is open, friend!
And if you don't let me secure the steam channel, your leg could get blown off.
And no, before you ask, it's not me. I know which side my bread is buttered on.
And why not? I'm handsome, strong and smart. What else could you possibly need?

Aye, not so long ago. Some'll tell you I stepped down on account of my old age.
Bah. He never had a connection with any of them beyond what his loins told him.
Be careful. The spirits can speak to the living if there's a strong connection.
Been a while since I've seen you at the meadery. Bring me anything interesting?
Before I could even draw my blade, her second arrow found its mark in my chest.
Boland speaks much about the war and the Stormcloaks but he knows who provides.
Bring it to me straight away when you find it. Don't dally. I can keep it safe.
But before we go any further, it's time for you to officially join the Legion. 
But you already have a traveling companion. I fear I would just get in the way.
By Shor's command we sheathed our blades and ventured not the vale's dark mist.
By the Mane, look. A dwarven city. Still sitting here after thousands of years.
Care to try out a new ring, or perhaps my daughter could make you a necklace...
Dangerous-looking elves who didn't give their names. Draw your own conclusions.
Dead? No, no, no, no, no! This is terrible. I don't know you. Get away from me!
Did he tell you what you wanted to know? Did he teach you the Dragonrend Shout?
Did you have any questions about the museum, or would you rather talk business?
Did you know that candle on the mantle hasn't gone out in over a hundred years?
Don't even want to think about what those cretins did to them before they died.
Don't forget getting a good pair of gauntlets. Broken hands can't hold a sword.
Don't give up now... there's plenty of loot out there just ripe for the taking.
Don't worry. I'll make sure he sees the light. I trusted you, now you trust me.
Dragons? You want to go out and fight dragons? Are you completely off your nut?
Erm... no. Not yet. I'm sorry, I was reading up on the effects of distillation.
Far you've travelled, your trials long, to taste of Sovngarde's sweet delights.
Farengar, I think I've found someone who can help you with your dragon project.
Finn was the bard who invented the eight course lute that is commonplace today.
Go forth. Do the biddings of Septimus, for he is working my will in your plane.
Go talk to Vex. She'll tell you the why's and how's if you want to get back in.
Good, you're back. Well, what did Mallory have to say? Is the amulet authentic?
Good. Here you are. He'll follow you to Oblivion and back, if it comes to that.
Good. The whole point of being in hiding is to appear to be someone you're not.
Got no time for a Nord who thinks he's better than everyone else. Keep walking.
Got stones in your ears? I asked what side you're on, Gray-Mane or Battle-Born!
Hasn't she told you? We were both Blades, back when that still meant something.
He never returned. From the journal you discovered, I'm sure you know the rest.
He's... he's not the best teacher. But just watching him, I've learned so much.
Hello, ladies! Is there anything a big strong man can do for you this fine day?
Here is the Book of Fate, discovered in a secret room in the Arcane University.
Here. Just don't make me look like an ass in front of the Guild and mess it up.
Hillevi Cruel-Sea comes in a lot, but I haven't seen her husband here in years.
His name's Mralki, and he's the innkeeper here. I hope you can change his mind.
His path will cross yours in time, but first you must find that which you need.
How dare you! After all we've been through together? How can you do this to me!
How many of their sons and daughters follow your banner? We are their families.
However, this hardly matters any longer as you appear to have exited unscathed.
Hroggar claims it was a hearth fire. Some folks say Hroggar started it himself.
I am not weak. Very well, outlander, I will go with you whenever you are ready.
I am the Jarl's Steward. If you have court business to tend to, you talk to me.
I can't say I'm happy with your decision. If you change your mind, let me know.
I don't dare return to Whiterun. But my mother... She'll need some consolation.
I don't know why you gave Ulfric so much. That murderer will never rule Skyrim.
I don't know you, and I don't sell what precious property we have to outsiders.
I feared she'd befallen the same fate, ending up a victim of Mercer's betrayal.
I had Markarth. My men and I drove the Nords out. We had won, or so we thought.
I had to leave them behind, had to sacrifice them so I could make it out alive.
I have a lot of respect for Ambarys Rendar, but his views are a little extreme.
I have been holding him here. While he regains strength, however, I am fading. 
I have dishonored my brothers by being captured, and so they have left me here.
I heard about you being pardoned. What were the guards thinking, taking you in?
I heard Temba yelling at you yesterday. Why do you let her treat you like that?
I heard what happened and the Guild owes you thanks for bringing this to light.
I hope the hunting goes well, sister. We've got the cowards on their heels now.
I just think pollinating would be easier if I could do a lot of plants at once.
I know they are. I've visited their ancient burial mounds and found them empty.
I know you, Ulfric. If I hand over Markarth, you'll be ready with a new demand.
I need you to put all your efforts into this job. We can't afford any mistakes.
I remember Skyrim from my youth, and the glistening crimson on fields of white.
I shouldn't be. Mama says if I do, people are going to ask about uncle Roggvir.
I spent years looking for what became of the ship, but I ended up empty-handed.
I swear that woman Aeri doesn't appreciate all the work I do for her damn mill.
I swear, if one more thing goes wrong, I'm going to burn my mill to the ground!
I think I've taught you everything I know. You might even be as good as me now.
I wish I could make my deliveries more often, but the road's getting dangerous.
I wish only an end to the fighting, so that I can tend to the temple once more.
I... I... I don't know what to say. Such kindness is unheard of in these times.
I'd be dead if not for Vignar. He took me in and helped me turn my life around.
I'd wager a well-placed shot at the ramp's mechanism would lower it in a hurry.
I'll keep watch in case Ulfric comes through here. Talos guide the both of you.
I'm afraid it's going to be a while before I can get any more Goldenglow Honey.
I'm positive whatever I require will be revealed to me on its own, in due time.
I'm relieved to hear you say that. If you were to leave, I'd miss you terribly.
I'm the Steward here.  I serve under Jarl Siddgeir and Jarl Dengeir before him.
I'm thinking of going for a walk up the mountain later. Would you like to come?
I've got a message for you from Louis Letrush. This is for double crossing him.
I've only ever lost a few guards to Steam Centurions. Good odds, considering...
I've seen you helping the Jarl. If only all visitors to Whiterun were as noble.
I've thought about that... Trees like this never really die. They only slumber.
If Sabjorn ever managed to push Maven off her pedestal, we'd all be in trouble.
If we take care of him, the way should be clear to properly assault the island.
If you can sneak into their camp and steal her plans, we'll have the advantage.
If you can sneak into their camp and steal his plans, we'll have the advantage.
If you run into my husband Nazeem, remind him that he's not married to himself.
If you wish to hunt with me, your feet need to be quick, and your eyes quicker.
If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time.
Imagine the heads of your enemies as you forge. Let your hatred work the steel.
Imperial troops will withdraw from Winterhold, and Kraldar will return as Jarl.
In exchange, I'm willing to let a few ingots go missing. Maybe more than a few.
In the meantime all I ask is you remain strong and put your trust in Lady Mara.
Indeed. One should find his death while he can still call himself a proper man.
It ain't right, movin' in with a new love the day after your kin die like that.
It is remarkable that so many of these ancient Dwemer creations still function.
It is said that the Phial will replenish whatever fluid is placed inside of it.
It is strange to think that these chambers were once home to the ancient Nords.
It means [QUOTE]Dwarven Museum.[QUOTE] Lost race of people that built the city.
It's nearly time to collect taxes on your properties here in the city, Bryling.
J'zargo is pleased, and more than a little jealous, to greet the new Arch-Mage.
Just remember everything I've taught you and you should be able to complete it.
Just remember the rules... keep it clean and keep it quiet. Here's the details.
Just your own two hands. Weapons and magic are out. Now let's see what you got!
Leave this shrine, blasphemer, before I kill you for defiling Azura's artifact.
Let him know that I'll watch out for them. I just want my daughter to be happy.
Let me guess, they're saying it's because of this trouble with the Stormcloaks?
Let's get back to Jorrvaskr. We'll want to pay our respects to Kodlak's spirit.
Like the Altmer? Yes, I would say their culture quite possibly rivaled our own.
Listen up, legionnaires. Those Stormcloaks are here for the same reason we are.
Look, I've never been good at these things, so I'm just going to keep it short.
Make it hurt. But not too much. No killing. And don't let the guards catch you.
Malacath has given me the task to mine. Good ore brings strength to our people.
Mara is the handmaiden of Kyne, the Goddess of the Storm and the Mother of Men.
Markarth is not without its problems, but the Empire is here to maintain order.
Markarth is... different from the rest of Skyrim, there's no doubt about that. 
Maybe you're right. I guess the battles I won yesterday won't win today's wars.
My husband Leigelf is dead. I... I never thought I would miss that oaf so much.
My mother's dead, but I won't close the inn. I've hired Leontius to run things.
My skill in battle is unmatched. Fortunately for you, that skill can be bought.
Narfi's happy now. Maybe Narfi can sleep. Sleep all night. Sleep, sleep, sleep.
Next time one of my shields deflects a killing blow, they'll change their tune.
Nice weapon you have there. But I don't suppose you'd consider putting it away?
No, just very difficult. You have to look for shift in various shades of white.
No! Tell me you're joking. Sweet Mara, what have I done? Go away. Just go away.
Not much work being a jailor. Long as you can ignore the pleading and all that.
Of course, leave an old man with a ruined dream. Just like everyone else. Fool.
Of course. You already saved Whiterun from that dragon. I owe you a great deal.
Oh no? So you're gonna fight back if I punch you? Huh? You're gonna hit a girl?
Oh, Ambassador Elenwen, that won't be necessary. It is just Razelan, after all.
Oh, and talk to Tonilia in the Flagon... she'll set you up with your new armor.
Oh, and when would that be, I wonder? When I sell my land to the Silver-Bloods?
Oh, I know, Thonar. Only a mad woman would ever betray the Silver-Blood family.
Oh, it's just wonderful being Skald's servant. He's not demanding in the least.
Oh, right, you were caught trying to cross the border into Skyrim, weren't you?
On moonlit nights or in darkened rooms, this agent literally becomes invisible.
One more time in case I wasn't clear. You butcher this job and you'll be sorry.
Only a Dragonborn can stop him. But no Dragonborn has been known for centuries.
Or perhaps you should crawl back into whatever swamp you came from, lizard man.
Our ancient debt for Alduin's reprieve is now repaid - the long night is ended!
Paaz Keizaal fen kos stin nol bein Alduin jot, Dovahkiin kos fin saviik do muz!
Papa says I'm not ready for weapons. So I make lots of horseshoes and hobnails.
Perfect, just perfect! These should help keep my stock fresh for quite a while.
Perhaps not as often as he should. In time, I believe he will be more trusting.
Perhaps this would be a good time to get the Dragonborn's input on this matter.
Perhaps we should find a random stranger to murder. Practice does make perfect.
Put on a cloth sack at the very least. You're making me... unseasonably warm...
Read carefully. You will see there are ways to stay true to the essence, Illdi.
Redbelly is supposed to be nothing but an iron mine. Been working it for years.
Right now, the best you could provide is coin. We need all the help we can get.
Skjor says that I have the strength of Ysgramor, and my brother has his smarts.
So we're not going to talk about this any more, right? Because I don't want to.
So, do you get that weird taste in your mouth before battle, too? What is that?
So, mage from Winterhold, despite your intentions I've beaten your little game.
So. Arngeir, is it? You know why we're here. Are you going to let us in or not?
Some kind of resonance... you and the wall. It must be connected to the amulet!
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't help you much right now... I'm currently in mourning.
Splendid! I've been looking for a new investor. Now it seems my search is over.
Steward, I will need the following reagents for my studies. Please see to them.
Still, Candlehearth Hall's got decent food and cheap bunks. You could do worse.
Suit yourself. But those who listen at doors always wonder what is beyond them.
Thanks. I guess this was the least you could do after what happened to Camilla.
That is for you to discover. We can show you the Way, but not your destination.
That's none of your business and I appreciate if you wouldn't mention it again.
The Blades killed them all centuries ago. Nobody asks to hear that lay anymore.
The blue thing? But even the simplest harmonic field is composed of entirely...
The College will be here for you, no matter what. We always look after our own.
The Companions? In Jorrvaskr? They're recruiting new members, from what I hear.
The crown should be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes open.
The day might come when I am forced to draw my sword for one side or the other.
The docks can be a dangerous place. Don't expect me to save you if you fall in.
The leader of the Dark Brotherhood? You mean Astrid? Dead? And this is no jest?
The Nords don't appreciate us, but so what? I don't appreciate them right back.
The people of Skyrim have no appreciation for what we do here. Not that I care.
The Stormcloaks will be here any minute! Hurry! Get inside and lock your doors!
The strongholds keep to themselves. Skyrim hasn't always been kind to the Orcs.
The tenacity of the Imperial Legion is legendary. We need to be ready for them.
The water is cold, but it's a lot better than having to work up in the dry air.
The world's going mad, and our Jarl doesn't care. She's only in it for herself.
There is no one else, but very well. I cannot force you to accept your destiny.
There's a lever, right there in the center. Hurry, before more of them show up!
These ruins and their mechanical inhabitants are all that remain of the Dwemer.
They are getting to be a problem. But I wasn't sent to Skyrim to fight dragons.
They focus on research banned by the Synod, such as Conjuration and Necromancy.
They just want to be sure that you're worthy. Be ready for an honorable battle.
They mean to take our history and crush it all in the name of some damn treaty.
This cold is unbearable. It's all I can do not to shiver until my teeth rattle.
This is my business. My city. You Empire lovers should learn to stay out of it.
Thoring, do you remember the time when that wolf pack come clamoring into town?
Those hill people who call themselves [QUOTE]the Forsworn[QUOTE] show no mercy.
Those who shirk their duties will get an extra beating. Do I make myself clear?
Try not to play favorites, Lady Ateia. It does a disservice to the whole class.
Turned on the Empire first chance he got. Now we're all part of this rebellion.
Up for a little hunting? My husband is being a sad stick, so I can't go myself.
Viarmo is too concerned with precision. What of instinct? Hmm? What of passion?
Walking the Steps. Meditating on the emblems. I make this trip every few years.
We hid from our past for years, became tradesman, people of coin and influence.
We remember what most don't - that the Dragonborn is the ultimate dragonslayer.
We were brought here by Jergen. Whether he was our father or not, I don't care.
We're ready to march on Solitude, but the Emperor's cousin is getting married! 
We're taking Falkreath. Get over there with the others. Fight well or die well.
Well, it's all over now. Lieutenant said you could see the smoke from Whiterun.
Well, well, you actually did what you said you were going to do. I'm impressed.
Well, well. You've slain my followers. I should destroy you for your impudence!
Well, well... color me impressed, lad. I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!
Well, you could always speak to Delvin or Vex if you're looking for extra work.
What decision is there to be made? I allowed him to live here. I stand by that.
What we do here today, we do for our country! For all the true Nords of Skyrim!
What would you have me do, woman? Cross the Guild? Take them all on one by one?
What? I'm not even... ah, I see. You have some knowledge of the alchemical art.
When he shows up here and vouches for you, then I'll see what I can do for you.
When you kill that Ice Wraith, then we'll talk about you becoming a Stormcloak.
When your Voice can open the path, you will know you are ready to speak to him.
With all three words together, this Shout is much more powerful. Use it wisely.
With that in mind, I propose that the position of Guild Master should be yours.
Wonderful. I'll use it to repair the tree. Thank you so much for all your help.
Yes, I know. In fact, by now, Captain Volf should be on his way to the prisons.
Yes, I've no doubt of its gravity. This, however, is a matter that cannot wait.
Yes, it's a great shame. Gods willing, I'll find someone just like her one day.
You are persistent, Dovahkiin. Pruzah ol aar. A fine slave you would have made.
You assist all you like. And get roasted for your trouble. I'll guard the exit.
You better quiet down before you end up there. Then I'd have to work the forge.
You got no respect, strutting about with that weapon out, threatening everyone.
You have to train a good war dog from a pup. Bite your arm clean off otherwise.
You have worked here in the Treasury House for a long time, haven't you Ildene?
You kill an Ice Wraith out there, and I'll have all the proof I need about you.
You know about Helgen? The Jarl will want to speak to you personally. Approach.
You know, I don't get the impression that I'm very well liked at the College...
You must find out how he does this, before he regains his strength and returns.
You must hear the Word within yourself before you can project it into a Thu'um.
You need something to do, or you just enjoy slowing down the hard-working folk?
You see, my name is Barbas. And I have a problem I think you can help sort out.
You should arrange the ceremony at the Temple of Mara right away. I can't wait.
You should wait until night fall before trying to sneak in. Talos preserve you.
You want to give up now? Out of fear? Is that what we're teaching our daughter?
You'll let me go. I know you will. This is all just part of the game we play...
You'll want the Bannered Mare. See old Hulda, she'll keep you swimmin' in mead.
You're back. Good. All right, so? Did you meet this Motierre? What did he want?
You're going to have the men around here wrapped around your finger in no time.
You're going to try to talk sense into that Orc? I'll believe it when I see it.
Your gear is in that chest. I'll lock the door behind you. Don't screw this up.
A most impressive attitude. Keep this up, and you'll do quite well for yourself.
A new face! Such a welcome sight in dreary old Morthal. Welcome friend, welcome!
A priest, filled with the taste of an easy life. Brother Verulus, from Markarth.
Again, and we break his grim hold over Shor's realm, and redeem it for eternity!
Ah, Berit's ashes. He was a good man. Not many warriors grow to a fine, old age.
Ah, I see. The old Dark Brotherhood [QUOTE]silent intimidation[QUOTE] treatment.
All of that blacksmithing... It's not good for a little girl. Ain't... ladylike.
All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you from the ridge. Good luck!
All you need to do is ask and we can both come out of this smellin' like a rose.
Alright, let's see if we have something here to end this as quickly as possible.
Among ourselves, of course. Mu ni meyye. None were yet ready to openly defy him.
And then there's Borvir and Rundi. Twins, though they rarely agreed on anything.
And two, you follow my lead and do exactly as I say... no questions, no excuses.
Are you here to talk about my brother? Do you think his execution was justified?
Are you working with the Battle-Borns? Speak now before I put you in the ground!
As I said, you will know you are ready when your Voice can open the path to him.
As you travel Skyrim, make sure you stop and take in the view from time to time!
Assorted wares and tools you just can't live without! Come and see for yourself!
Aye, Dragonborn. Maybe you can stop the dragons - and this war into the bargain.
Bandits are the worst lot. They'd steal from their own mothers given the chance.
Before we enter, I must warn you about the dangers that could be lurking within.
Blast, girl, I told you to leave my tools alone. You have yours and I have mine.
But I also enjoy learning the latest gossip and hear the most intriguing rumors.
But they did not trust us. Ni ov. Their inner councils were kept hidden from us.
But... To have won against Malacath himself... That would be seen as real power.
Citizen. You have been warned. You leave me no choice but to resort to violence.
Come back when you're ready to spend more gold... goodness knows I could use it.
Come to Olava for a reading, did you? Sorry, pup, but I'm not quite in the mood.
Damn it, child, didn't I tell you to gather my notes on sub-material properties?
Dawnstar is the last port of call before Solitude. Damn rebels aren't taking it.
Dean Inge says a bard can never have enough practice. So, would you like a tune?
Did you try the grip? Isn't it eerie how it seems to mold itself into your hand?
Dig, Dwemer, in the beyond. I'll know your lost unknown and rise to your depths.
Do you have any idea who I am? When my father hears about this, he will gut you.
Do you honestly think your arrow will reach me before my blade finds your heart?
Do you know the College of Winterhold? They have a deep interest in such arcana.
Do you think the Forsworn will come here? I mean, if they attacked Kolskeggr....
Do you think there's treasure here? Something to make J'zargo a powerful wizard?
Don't lecture me about treachery, whelp. You don't know the meaning of the word.
Don't worry about it, Svana. It's my problem... no need for you to get involved.
Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent or allow it to generate its own field?
Elda, you know better than to believe every idiot traveler that wanders through.
Every day the threat of exile from Riften draws closer for myself and my family.
Every knight needs a squire. I could help you with your sword, things like that.
Every moment you waste is another moment those doors stay shut tight. Get going!
Finally, both of my mines are open again. Time for everyone to get back to work.
Friga Shatter-Shield's old place? It's been abandoned ever since she was killed.
Funny, when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.
Good to have some fresh eyes up there at the top. I follow your lead, Harbinger.
Gunjar isn't coming back from the dead. Take his armor and anything else on him.
Hand it over to me. I will ask Azura to restore the Star to its original purity.
He he. Don't forget that I am Shadowscale. I was, quite literally, born to kill.
He treats me like a slave... I have to do every nasty, dirty job in the meadery.
He's been in Kynesgrove forever. Great storyteller. Keeps everyone's spirits up.
Hemming, I need you to bring a note to Sibbi. I need him to do something for me.
Her mother would have had the key, but she... that family is cursed, I tell you.
Hey, Longhammer, set us up with a round of... what in Oblivion happened in here?
However, ever since that day, I've felt my power waning... slowly draining away.
I also want to know how they managed to get the place up and running so quickly.
I apologize in advance for my husband's crankiness; I promise you he means well.
I been a sailor for so long, I could navigate these rivers an' seas blindfolded.
I bet you could slay one of those mean old dragons. I bet you could do anything.
I can but hone their skills and harden their hearts. The rest is up to the gods.
I couldn't agree more. By the way, have you heard any interesting rumors lately?
I don't know about the others, but I sure am glad to see a fresh face down here.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you. I can't just let this go unpunished.
I don't know where to start. You know I was assigned to General Tullius's guard.
I don't think he would have wanted your absolution, Rorlund. He worshiped Talos.
I feared I would never see you again. I was afraid you'd become like the others.
I have a feeling about you. Your place is on that battlefield. I need you there.
I have nothing to say to you. Now move along, or I'll order my guards to attack.
I have vowed to serve Amaund Motierre until my dying breath. Best remember that.
I hope the hunting goes well, brother. We've got the cowards on their heels now.
I knew better. Tiid bo amativ. Time flows ever onward. One day he would surface.
I know, I know... Wars to fight, dragons to confront, guild business to conduct.
I need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar.
I stand with the Stormcloaks. You Imperial dogs will never break my will. Never!
I think it very likely that he will be unable to resist investigating your call.
I thought Laelette left to join the war. I hadn't heard from her since she left.
I want to thank you for your help. I know my master can be a bit short at times.
I won't be married to some weak-willed Orc chieften. I'd sooner join the Legion.
I worry that Shor won't call an animal to glory as he would a true Nord warrior.
I'd be out there fighting the Imperials right now if it wasn't for my war-wound.
I'll put it simply, so you'll understand. I advise the Jarl in matters of magic.
I'm afraid there's not much to be said. Winterhold is hardly what it used to be.
I'm bitter because we had lives in Cyrodiil. And we came out here to be paupers.
I'm glad you're here. I have a message I need delivered to the Jarl of Whiterun.
I'm just glad to put all this behind me. So let's never speak of it again, okay?
I'm not [QUOTE]fretting.[QUOTE] I don't want Eirid playing those sorts of games!
I'm not sure what just happened but I assure you I will get to the bottom of it.
I'm strong, and quick, and can do any chore you want. Come on, adopt me. Please?
I've a lot of respect for the Restoration School. Skyrim could use more healers.
I've got a sharp woman on the job right now. She should be returning any moment.
If I am to die today, so be it. But you'll not soon forget the Dark Brotherhood.
If this cold numbs my fingers any worse, I'll scarcely be able to hold a weapon.
If Ulfric needs a favor, he has it. Anyone else better pay well for the service.
If you bring mead, you're welcome here! Even if you don't, you're still welcome!
If you can bring it back, we could restore the paragon... and reap its benefits.
If you find yourself in such a situation, then you need to make your shot count.
If you give me a list, I'll have them delivered to the dock by tomorrow morning.
If you have any further questions, can you please hold them until I've finished?
If you really think this is the only way, I trust you. Let's not waste any time.
If you're not afraid of little exploring, I'll pay good gold to get those salts.
If you're still breathing in a few weeks, I'm sure we'll be the best of friends.
Is that so? Well then, I'll have to charge you with disturbing the Jarl's peace.
It has everything to do with politics. Asgeir my son, you have so much to learn.
It is called [QUOTE]Dragonrend[QUOTE], but its Words of Power are unknown to us.
It is done. Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, and the Dark Brotherhood yet lives.
It matters little to me. Either way I'll be sending your heads back to Cyrodiil.
It was a minor miscalculation. I've already corrected it for future experiments.
It won't repair the tree back at the temple, but we could bring them a new one. 
It's a new day in Windhelm. The Stormcloaks are gone, and so is their prejudice.
It's enough for me to know that they're out there somewhere, and together again.
It's in the most immediate danger, if that dragon is lurking in the mountains...
It's not working. Why don't you give it a try? Just put your hands on the altar.
It's only a bit of fun. You're a lovely young thing, you should try it sometime.
It's the peace treaty that ended the war with the Elves of the Aldmeri Dominion.
Just have a few swings at me so I can see your form. Don't worry, I can take it.
Just worry about keeping the fields tended and let the Jarl worry about the war.
Keep your eyes open for traps. Old ruins like this are usually filled with them.
Let me make this plain and simple. No more jobs until you pay Vex. No get to it.
Lyin' to my face isn't gonna win you any favors with me, I can promise you that.
Madesi, have you heard the Imperials might be headed this way? What would we do?
Maybe we could invite some of those nice guards over. You know, for some supper?
My apologies. We'll have to get better acquainted later. Please, enjoy yourself.
My brother told me you were coming. I'm supposed to give you what you've earned.
My daughter Karita sings to the guests when she can. She has her mother's voice.
My pa runs this town, and you're going to be in big trouble if you mess with me.
My pa used to say there ain't no use worryin' about the things you can't change.
Nepos the Nose handles that part of our business. He has a way with the workers.
Never mind. I can see that these are the best terms we'll get from this council.
Never said that. Just that we don't get many of you wanting to join, that's all.
Nice to be here on the home-front. Wouldn't mind being down in Cyrodiil, though.
No one talks to Madanach, I'm afraid. Not without getting past Borkul the Beast.
No, no, of course not. Forgive me, Dragonborn. I have been intemperate with you.
No, you're right. After all this time, Ulfric still holds almost half of Skyrim.
Not at this rate. I'll just go back to clubbing horkers and scaring the debtors.
Not only that but they're givin' us thieves a bad name by murderin' their marks.
Not to mention the rebels completely control Windhelm and all of Eastmarch hold.
Oh, I'd get in trouble for that. It's not allowed. Besides, it's scary in there!
Oh, merciful Arkay, no! I am too old and frail, and this graveyard is too large.
Oh, no. Only the Circle have the beastblood. Prove your honor to be a Companion.
One of the mages there may be able to put you on the trail of this Elder Scroll.
Only thirty more and it'll be all yours. If I might ask, who is the lucky woman?
Paarthurnax has made the decision to help you. This is the road we have to walk.
Pah. The gods have a place for killers. You can't carry the burden? You're weak.
Pavo and I had to fight our way out of Kolskeggr. Forsworn killed everyone else.
Persistent aren't you? Oh, very well. Who am I to stand in the way of curiosity?
Pilgrim or not, if I were you, I'd move right through our backwards little town.
Please, I'm desperate. This is my brother's life! I won't let them take it away!
Please! I'll pay you. I'll give you whatever you want. Just don't leave me here!
Poor Roggi. If you're feeling charitable, buy the Nord a mead. He's good for it.
Remember - don't trust the Imperials. No matter what honeyed lies they tell you.
Rjorn's drum! Nobody knows where he died, and therefore where his drum might be.
Shor's favor has found you, Dragonborn. The Hall of Valor, heart's-ease, awaits.
Shout for Odahviing from the Dragonsreach courtyard. After that, it's up to you.
Sigh... I'm not proud of it. I'm terrified of that place and Aunt Agna knows it.
Silus keeps filling his house with those Mythic Dawn things. Creepy, I tell you.
Sir, the Imperial Legion has again requested assistance. What shall I tell them?
Skyrim isn't very friendly for Argonians, so we mostly just keep out of the way.
So be it. I'm sure Arkay will find it in his heart to forgive you... eventually.
So exciting when new folk come into town. I bet you've had plenty of adventures.
So I gave her some advice, pointed her towards Hobs Fall Cave and that was that.
Someone's trying to take us down by driving a wedge between Maven and the Guild.
Something different about you, I can tell. Hope you ain't here to cause trouble.
Sorry. I thought I saw a fellow running away, but didn't get a good look at him.
Speak with Galmar. He'll size you up and see where we can best use your talents.
Steady now! They may be uglier than Imperials but they'll go down just the same.
Stormcloaks have taken the Reach, but we'll return. The Empire will bring order.
Strength and steel are well and good, but magic is the true power in this world.
Thank you, Legate. In the future, I'll let you know when your opinion is needed.
That was the hairiest fight I've ever been in, and I've been in more than a few.
That's quite a noble sentiment for someone in our... well, in your line of work.
That's right! Papa helped me with the clasps, but I did all the links on my own.
That's your imagination running wild. Nobody knows how we feel about each other.
The butler did it! Or is it the advisor? Whoever that man behind the throne was.
The dawn surely opens upon you, child. You must bear its light that all may see.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.
The Falmer. There have been reports that they've been attacking people at night.
The Forsworn are as wild as wolves. Practice those old magics, so some folk say.
The Greybeards stay away from me, and I stay away from them. Suits me just fine.
The guards in this city are all lazy and undisciplined. Things need to change...
The Guild has a lot riding on this. Don't make me look foolish by mucking it up.
The inns at Dragonbridge and Rorikstead are frequent stops for Imperial runners.
The Jarl and I have our disagreements. Sorry if you had to overhear one of them.
The Jarl has recognized you as a person of great importance in the hold. A hero.
The mine's always on the verge of collapse. Good thing I'm around to keep it up.
The most well known stronghold is Dushnikh Yal. Here, I'll mark it down for you.
The owner of this place just inherited an heirloom from a relative. You want in?
The sailors I know are plenty good at finding trouble without any help from you.
The Shadowscales are all but forgotten. An ancient tradition, from another time.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.
There was love between our families. For generations. Now, there is only enmity.
There's no mistake. You're a wanted man... and it's time to pay for your crimes.
There's nothing else to discuss. Use the North Gate if you want to enter Riften.
These old ruins... They don't want us here, the ancient ones. Better left alone.
They call me a war hero. I'm no hero, I'm just a soldier who didn't want to die.
This council is unprecedented. We are gathered here at the Dragonborn's request.
This is just like Gallus. A dear friend, but always too clever for his own good.
This is no time to play the reluctant hero. You either are or aren't Dragonborn.
This is really quite a nice town when you get down to it. Just look at the view!
Tolfdir is still there now, is he? I shall expect a full report when he returns.
Vekel, you have no shame. I'll get you the rest like I said. I want that hammer.
Wait, oh wait. I know you! Yes, yes. From the road! Cicero never forgets a face.
War is not new to Falkreath. You have only to stand in our cemetery to see that.
Was I correct in hearing that you were traveling to the grove of the Eldergleam?
Watch your tongue, native. We'll leave when we're sure there's no Forsworn here.
We all have you to thank for saving the College. Your position is well-deserved.
We heard the news at Cloud Ruler by courier, riding hard from the Imperial City.
We may guard Whiterun, but the Thieves Guild guards us. If you know what I mean.
We shouldn't have been disturbing Saarthal, no matter what you found down there.
We'll stick around here for a while and see if we can find anything else useful.
We've bloodied him well. Four of his kin have fallen to my blade alone this day.
We've failed. The city is lost. They're through the gates and will be here soon.
We've taken it before. I'm only asking for what will be ours soon enough anyway.
Welcome to the Vilemyr Inn. If there's anything I can get you, just let me know.
Well, as it turns out, I had a pet skeever when I was a boy and he used to wink.
Well, I... I simply thought you might wish to help out one of your fellow mages.
Well, I'd better get to work. I have to fix another saw blade for Gerdur's mill.
Well, there are three of them. Arranged in three tiers, as you may have noticed.
Well, well... color me impressed, lass. I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!
What was I thinking? It would never work that first way. Why didn't you tell me?
What? I never even cast... ah, I see. You have some knowledge of the Higher Art.
What? Your heroic tale of locking yourself in the Ratway for years isn't enough?
What's taking them so long? Did they get lost? Let's get this over with already.
What's this? Is it spoiling for a fight? If not, it should hide its weapon away.
When we arrive, blood is spilled and our blades sing to the glories of Ysgramor.
When you make up your mind, come find me there and we'll talk about your future.
Who are you? Why are you here? Leave this place. I have much work to conduct....
Winterhold doesn't offer much, but we like living here. Been here all our lives.
With my swords in their hands, Ulfric's men will send those legion dogs running.
With open arms, with cheers and song, with joy in my heart and tears in my eyes!
Without all our money going to drink, I can afford to expand my selection a bit.
Yes, yes. Let's keep our voices down, all right? Just make sure this gets there.
You can tell Sven that he already has a mother. I'm not speaking to him anymore.
You do Kyne proud. Only one challenge remains. Go and defeat the troll champion.
You don't seem to realize there's a war on. What you are is a damn Imperial spy!
You have no idea what it's like to have everything, then watch it all disappear.
You have talent. Keep working at your craft, and you'll be a fine smith one day.
You know what? You're not worth the hassle. Go... be some other guard's problem.
You need to teach him a lesson... show him the penalty for betrayal around here.
You sound like my ma. Figured I was lying dead in a field somewhere, is that it?
You sure took care of that dragon. Dragonborn or not, that's good enough for me.
You think you can bully me. I grew up with five brothers. Go... get...my...ring.
You won't be laughing when the Thalmor come to root out Stormcloak sympathizers.
You wouldn't be a sellsword, would you? I have a little problem you could solve.
You'd better give me five septims right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose...
You'd do well to remember that the next time you make such a stupid observation.
You'll also need to decide whether to devote yourself to a single type of spell.
You'll pay those rumors no heed if you wish to retain your welcome in this city.
You're always a sight for sore eyes. Here, I've been hanging on to this for you.
You're Dragonborn, and you're the only one who can stop Alduin. Don't forget it.
You're that one lives in Breezehome, right? Fine place. Almost bought it myself.
You've already taken all the necessary steps in becoming eligible for the title.
You've come far, mortal, but can you stand against my inner council?  Let's see!
You've made Narfi so happy! Narfi now waits for his sister until she comes home.
You've saved my business and warmed an old smith's heart. For that, I thank you.
...when I next meet, that fair maid Nelly, I'll plunge my knife into her belly...
A day goes by without someone trying to gut me in the street, I get disappointed.
A wise course of action, my Jarl. However, we have little food or water to spare.
Aam? Serve you? ...no. Ni tiid. If and when you defeat Alduin, I will reconsider.
After we were robbed, Dravin's become more bitter than ever. He hates this place.
Ah, Karliah. I was wondering when I'd hear from you again. Lose something did we?
Ah, Moon Sugar. I could smell it on you. I'm pleased with this offer, and accept.
Ah, the one generous soul amongst a gathering of pinch-pennies and lick-spittles!
Ah! It's been too long since last I faced a doom-driven hero of the dragon blood.
Alduin, feyn do jun, kruziik vokun staadnau, voth aan bahlok wah diivon fin lein!
All right, all right. Just keep your voice down and don't let me catch you again.
All right. That should do it. I think I'm ready to try the College again. Thanks!
Although, come to think of it, I did hear some odd noises coming from over there.
Always something going wrong. Mill needs more lumber or the saw needs sharpening.
And I wouldn't very well tell you about the cuts if I had made them, now would I?
And you did just that! I haven't been so entertained in at least a hundred years.
Annekke used to help more with the mining, but nowadays she's a bit of a bounder.
Another batch of logs completely ruined. I swear, these bears have it out for me.
Any last requests before I send you to... to wherever you people go when you die.
Anything you can do to keep his filthy hands off of me would be a welcome change.
Are you excited to see what's in there? This is important to you Nords, isn't it?
Are you paying attention, Delphine? You might learn something of our own history.
Aren't you supposed to be in Markarth? Finish that job and we'll talk about more.
Arkay will guard our eternal rest. His servants shall protect the dead from harm.
Assur always wants to play [QUOTE]Hunt the Elf[QUOTE] and he makes me be the Elf.
At least Sabjorn has found himself in Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.
At times like this, I truly appreciate the joys of a warm fire and a stiff drink.
Been a long time since someone took the leap. Longer still since any survived it.
Bolli's around somewhere, planning to feed the poor with his nonsense about Mara.
But first we need to get our hands on some Imperial orders to make the forgeries.
But for now, you're off to speak to Maven Black-Briar. She asked for you by name.
But remember, you're still oathbound to our cause. Skyrim still waits to be free.
But without Ulfric, the movement will wither and die. It's only a matter of time.
But... You could take word to her in Solitude, let her know it'll be coming soon.
By Sithis, this ends now! Back away, fool! Whatever you've been planning is over!
Calcelmo? Is he interested in Faleen? That sly old codger. I should have guessed.
Changed your mind? You ready to pledge your blood and honor for Skyrim's freedom?
City's quiet enough now. But when the sun goes down, you best keep on your guard.
Crazy person... Something must be wrong with its head, to strut around like that.
Despite what you discovered it's still comforting to know my husband is at peace.
Dez motmahus. Even to the dov, who ride the currents of Time, destiny is elusive.
Did you know there are some fruits that actually grow better in the cold weather?
Do you like magic? Falion says I'm good at learning. I like learning about magic.
Don't you think I'd make a wonderful Master Wizard? Maybe even Arch-Mage someday?
Every blade I make honors Malacath. Every rivet, every plate of armor is for him.
Excuse me, but do you know anything about this house? Seen anyone enter or leave?
Fair Skyrim will be free from foul Alduin's maw, Dragonborn be the savior of men!
Falkreath is where people go to die. We could be fighting, taking back Nord land!
Fine, but I've locked the door so don't think you're getting in there without me.
First war, and now dragons. Everywhere they go, the Nords bring nothing but ruin.
First, let's be clear. This council wasn't my idea. I think it's a waste of time.
For someone called the [QUOTE]Listener,[QUOTE] you do an awful lot of shouting...
For what it's costing me, I should be handed the merchandise on a silver platter.
Fortunately, they seem to be sticking to the barrow. I think they're guarding it.
Gaius Maro still lives. I am surprised. I had assumed you were more... competent.
Get over to our camp in Hjaalmarch. We need to strengthen our defensive position.
Good business for the East Empire Company means all the more gold for the Empire.
Good. Wipe them out. So long as one of them is left alive, they will come for me!
Great. Get back to me when you're done and I'll give you something for your time.
Ha! I'll see to it the Jarl hears of your abuse of a court scholar. Shame on you.
Halt. You're under arrest for murder and conspiracy against the city of Markarth!
He calls out in his sleep sometimes. I've heard Falion's name. What does it mean?
He just keeps to himself in what's left of his folk's farmhouse across the river.
He was a great war leader of the ancient Nords, a master of the Voice, or Tongue.
He will come. He cannot ignore our defiance. And why should he fear us, even now?
Hey, I found a crown over here on this corpse. Is this the one we're looking for?
Hmm? Oh, sorry. My mind wanders sometimes. I was just thinking about Finn's Lute.
Hmm. I guess I'll defer to your judgment on this one, but I think it's a mistake.
How pathetic, being forced to eke out a miserable existence in a place like this.
However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold.
I am not [QUOTE]up to[QUOTE] anything. I apologize if I have offended in any way.
I am pleased, mortal. I will give you my Razor. Use it to wreak havoc on Tamriel.
I believe you'll find the guards to be a bit more cordial with you in the future.
I can only give you my word as a priest of Mara that my intentions are honorable.
I can't fight. Not even a little bit. My family thinks I'm a little milk drinker.
I cannot protect you if you murder us. This is the only warning you will receive.
I did ask. Although I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're really on. Still...
I do not envy those creatures that make a home in such cold, dark places as this.
I don't care what Beem says. It's high time we get in there and find our fortune.
I don't understand how paper will help the dregs of this city, but suit yourself.
I don't want any of you thieving workers even thinking about stealing any silver.
I enjoy steady patronage in the Bannered Mare. I do hope you'll watch me perform.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Nothing around here has been going well lately.
I have a feeling I'm not going to like what happens when we get back to Clavicus.
I have a message for you to deliver to our friend, the esteemed Jarl of Windhelm.
I hear there's a priest of Mara visiting the inn. Maybe the Divines will cure us.
I hope Arkay grants my wife some comfort. Thank you. Here. I always pay my debts.
I hope you will find a warmer welcome in your travels than we have found in ours.
I kind of like watching things from where I am. Making money is all I care about.
I know he's from the Thalmor, and that he claims to be here simply as an advisor.
I know just what you mean. Heard anything interesting lately? Any news or gossip?
I may not be fond of Letrush, but even I've got to admit he's got the upper hand.
I mean no offense. I am but a humble farmer. Not a... a great wanderer, like you.
I need to lock the door behind you or the patrols might notice something's wrong.
I sell cases of it for half of what the inns and taverns pay through the Meadery.
I suggest you talk to Karliah first. She has some news that'll turn your stomach.
I think it was Margret. Poor woman, she was just visiting the city from Cyrodiil.
I tug at the web of connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal.
I want to know what I'm dealing with before I start tearing it out of the ground.
I want you to finish that job in Whiterun first. Then we'll talk about more work.
I was a much younger man when I married Katla. Now I can hardly keep up with her.
I was approached by a woman who wanted me to act as the broker for something big.
I'll see about getting this order filled right away. Here, a few septims for you.
I'm imagining you just standing your ground and letting them tire themselves out.
I'm not half the wizard my uncle was, but I still have a few spells worth buying.
I'm not much of a strategist, but Lord Ulfric listens to my counsel all the same.
I'm sorry mother, I just want to know more about him. You never tell me anything!
I'm sure you could charge double for those and still sell them all within a week.
I'm well. How are things over at the stables? Old Hofgrir giving you a hard time?
I've been burned a few times, made a few bad deals, but mostly I come out on top.
I've been forbidden to deal with you until amends are made with the Guild. Sorry.
I've never been one to lead. Never desired it, never cared for it. Don't want it.
I've seen a lot of thieves come and go, but I've never seen anyone as good as me.
I've seen every corner of Skyrim, but nothing is as beautiful as the battlefield.
If it isn't the slayer of the Glenmoril Witches. How can I assist you, Companion?
If we can just find out what Shout the ancient Nords used, you may have a chance.
If you need marksman training, and you've got the coin... I'm ready to teach you.
If you see any signs of Talos worship, it's your obligation to report them to me.
If you want some information about the area, Annekke knows it better than anyone.
If you want to call it that, yes. Me? I think she was softening him for the kill.
If you wish to gain Boethiah's attention, you must slay a thrall upon her shrine.
In order to learn and use this Shout, you will be taking this evil into yourself.
Is that so? I don't recognize you. Why aren't you wearing your Stormcloak colors?
It pleases me to know that I can still be of use even in the twilight of my life.
It was a cold day. The end of Frostfall is nearly winter in the Jerall Mountains.
It was anger that brought each of us here, but it is love that keeps us fighting.
It was as big as the mountain, and black as night. It flew right over the barrow.
It worked, but not fully. And the uhh... The device was destroyed in the process.
It's an evil substance. Whoever's selling it to you should be brought to justice.
It's difficult to explain to the layman -- forgive me if I begin waxing alchemic.
It's our wedding day. I feel like all of Skyrim is focused on just the two of us.
It's remarkable that our farms are so prosperous given the harsh winters of late.
Join the forces mustering at the [CAPITAL] (infos conditions on location go here)
Just arrive in the city? Is it true what they say, then? There are dragons about?
Just between you and me, I wouldn't mind if the Empire just up and left for good.
Just like anywhere else, it's all about who you know. Lucky for you, you know me.
Keepin' the palace clean an' the lords fed ain't easy work, but it's honest work.
Kematu is west of Whiterun. It's an unassuming little cave called Swindler's Den.
Kreh zini! The freedom of the sky beckons! Yet I stay here, nau gol, as promised.
Laelette thought she could take me and keep me, but she can't. I'm all burned up.
Larina. That fool student of mine stole my flute and sold it to some necromancer.
Like I said, name's Angi and I've been living out here for a couple of years now.
Like it or not, you are a shining example to future generations of College Mages.
Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room after he got it.
Long as I stay out of the way, the guards don't seem to care about me being here.
Look at him, rummaging through refuse. Wonder what he's lost... besides his mind.
Mark my words. Thonar Silver-Blood was behind that attack in the market. Somehow.
Mauhulakh was such a darling boy. Until he got older and started having opinions.
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. I can't be expected to remember every deal I handle.
Mind you, it's no business of mine what each Companion does in the name of honor.
My oath binds me, Dragonborn. Until Paarthurnax is dead, you aren't welcome here.
Nenya's history of service is impeccable.  She truly is the Steward of Falkreath.
Next, I need dirt on the Jarl's Steward. Heard there's blackmail potential there.
Nightmares. I haven't met a single man or woman who doesn't admit to having them.
No gloom can hold my heart for long in Shor's bless'd hall, where no shadows lie.
No sarcasm this time. You faced a vampire, and lived to tell the tale. Well done.
No. I'm a Breton from High Rock, and I refuse to be mistaken for a filthy native.
No... no, that is all. Now... now please. I find myself very weary all of sudden.
Not to mention my great fondness for dragons and petty political power struggles.
Now go. And give the city of Solitude a celebration they're not likely to forget.
Now you just stay here, with all your friends, and I'm going to go get my shovel.
Now? You could use it for what we meant it for. Using black souls for enchanting.
Of course, non-mages may not see it that way, so we don't go around flaunting it.
Oh my. He was always so kind to me. A bit rough around the edges, but a good man.
Oh, just look at you. Absolutely brilliant. Now... now you're just as I imagined.
Old lady Frida is a grouch, but she sure can whip up a cure for the Rattles fast.
Once Kodlak began looking for his cure, I'd wager Skjor didn't bring it up again.
Pantea, perhaps you should attend to your students, and leave the politics to me.
Perhaps some hero will bring one to Dragonsreach, like old Olaf One-Eye once did.
Protect us, Arkay, from the foul and unclean who seek to disturb the dead's rest.
Prove your valor in the Pit! If you haven't got any valor, prove your pocketbook!
Quickly now, quickly! I'll find Mirabelle and see if we can't put a stop to this!
Quit taking advantage of us and this world might be a better place, you got that?
Right. You adventuring types would never go into a room just to steal everything.
Runnin' an inn weren't my plan. But Falion decided to move here, so I joined him.
Secondly, I need to cripple rebel production capabilities with a little sabotage.
Seems there's no end to the needs of the Imperials. But what can I help you with?
She would? If she's willing to deal with him, then everything would be all right.
So don't get your hopes up. It's mostly lies, leavened with rumor and conjecture.
So it seems the milk drinkers were right. That dragon was nearly the death of us.
Sometimes I like to think my cooking is like playing the flute or singing a song.
Speaking of fortune. Here. Everything I earned from my last shipment. It's yours.
Sure I'm a little green, but what I lack in experience, I make up for in courage.
Takes a fair bit of strength to carry a greatsword like that. But can you use it?
Thank you for your help. I will make my home here, away from anyone I might hurt.
Thank you. It's nice to know someone admires me for more than just my appearance.
Thank you. You've done a good thing for me and my workers. Here. This is for you.
Thanks so much. I'll return to temple. Here's something for your time and effort.
That was Shouting, what you just did! Must be. You really are Dragonborn, then...
The Arcanaeum is located above the hall, and the Arch-Mage's quarters above that.
The Blades have always guarded and guided the Dragonborn. But we'd forgotten why.
The Bunkhouse is for the working man, not some sort of a luxury inn for tourists.
The Emperor's cousin, killed. Right here in Solitude. I feel nothing but shame...
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.
The Jarl has too much on his mind right now, we won't be troubling him with this.
The look on Tullius's face while the Greybeard read the terms was worth the trip.
The stones aren't what bother me, love. The Forsworn are tearing the Reach apart.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.
The Sybil of Dibella spends her entire life in direct communion with the goddess.
The temple contract? Well, I certainly won't deny my involvement. He he he he he.
There are no jails in an Orc Stronghold, criminal. You must pay in gold or blood.
There is an unnatural chill in the air. Some evil power is at work in this place.
There's no honor in being a Jarl's servant. No Sovngarde waits for dust cleaners.
There's plenty of gold out there for the taking... if you're up to the challenge.
These ruins might be interesting if I wasn't already an expert on Nordic history.
They say Falion of Morthal has studied vampires, draugr and all matter of undead.
They say I'm just snooping around bothering people, but I'm trying to save lives!
This city is crawling with Imperial Legion, and you know what? I'm still nervous.
This is a proper store. Start acting like a proper customer. Sheathe that weapon.
This is grave news indeed, she's someone I hoped to never cross paths with again.
This is our homeland, Tullius. All the blood spilled in this war is on your head.
This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Sister here.
This is the reason you wake me? I already have Orchendor's request taken care of.
Though shall mourn my brother, I thank you, friend. You've given me my life back.
Though we live in shadow, we carve indelible signs of our passing into the world.
To activate this strange power, one must only speak the magic words, which are...
To think, my little boy is married. And to an Imperial. Oh, they grow up so fast.
Trader dropped by recently with some lovely pieces, if you'd like to have a look.
Try not to disturb me in the future, I'm in the midst of groundbreaking research!
Ugh. Erikur, right? He was talking to me earlier. I could tell what he was after.
Ulfric will withdraw his forces from Falkreath, allowing Jarl Siddgeir to return.
Under the authority of Mara, the Divine of Love, I declare this couple to be wed.
Very good, Aia. Class, observe her finger movements. Let's try a few more pieces.
Walking away without taking a job is like passing a bloated coinpurse on a table.
We choose our battles, and you've chosen yours. Someone else can take care of it.
We heard the news from Whiterun - that you left the city on the back of a dragon!
We're fighting because we're done bleeding for an Empire that won't bleed for us.
We're going to take out their sentry, then sneak into their camp and ambush them.
We're not. The Silver-Bloods pay our wage. Every man here is a trained mercenary.
We've found a cave. I don't think there are warm fires and friendly faces inside.
We've got another dozen ripening on the vine. They should be ready in a few days.
Welcome. If I cannot serve you, I am sure that one of my other traders can do so.
Well at least now Mauhulakh has nothing to whine about. Until this one dies, too.
Well, you were right. These so called 'Gutter Saints' live in the sewers beneath.
Well. They've been hunting down Blades since the Great War, on general principle.
What? We've got nothing to talk about until you come back from Serpentstone Isle.
What? Why? I don't understand... I have done nothing to wrong you. Please, mercy!
What?! No, that's not me. I'm not Esbern. I don't know what you're talking about.
What're you lookin' at? I'm not afraid of you, ya know. Even if you are my elder.
What's the meaning of this interruption? Jarl Balgruuf is not receiving visitors.
When I met Michel, I knew this was where I belonged. I suppose that's it, really.
When I'm cutting wood, I pretend there's an Imperial soldier's head on the stump.
When your enemies lie broken and bloody before you, know that I will be watching.
Where do these demands stop, Ulfric? Do you expect me to surrender all of Skyrim?
Who cares who worships what dead god? Give me something to make me draw my sword.
Why does everyone ignore me? Why do you turn your heads? Why will no one help me?
Why does Shor forbid us to face Alduin? I fear no worm, World-Eater though he be.
Why we bothered to capture Riften I'll never understand. Just look at this place.
With Nurelion gone, I suppose Quintus has taken over business in the White Phial.
With those three vessels, Hevnoraak can restore himself. Find them before he can.
Worse still, he uses the power stored within my own token to fuel his foul deeds.
Yamarz was a coward and a weakling. His deceitful ways have cost you all greatly.
Yes of course. I'm simply trying to understand the reasoning behind the decision.
Yes. Kill the chef, and then steal his very identity. For that is the true death.
Yes. Yes, fine, I'll come to this Greybeard council. For all the good it will do.
You are looking for Arkay's protection while you delve some dank tomb, I take it?
You better straighten things with the Guild or you won't be welcome here anymore.
You can't scare me with your tough talk. I'm not paying you people a single coin.
You get used to the cold after a while. The harder you work, the warmer you stay.
You have to keep your ward up, or else this won't work. I don't want to hurt you.
You here from the city? I visit Whiterun from time to time, mostly to make deals.
You just wait. My new pranks are going to the best ever! You'll see! He he he he.
You met Camilla yet? Wouldn't mind getting my hands on those trunks. He he he he.
You must bring it to Avanchnzel, in the west. Return it to them. It must go back.
You see, all you need is a bit of spirit and any song can be made into a classic.
You should ask him about his work. It's the only subject that'll get him talking.
You should buy some produce from Carlotta's stall. Most of it comes from my farm.
You should tell the priest we're getting married. They'll take things from there.
You think I'd be in hiding if this was something I trusted town guards to handle?
You want knives? You want them in your belly? No? Then you stop talking to Deeja.
You were guided here; you were always meant to be here. That's the way of things.
You were ranting but most of it was slurred. You said something about Rorikstead.
You withdraw from the Pale, and allow Jarl Skald the Elder to return to Dawnstar.
You'd better give me five septims, right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose...
You'll be helping out an old beggar, and the Divines smile on that sort of thing.
You're lying. You're not quick enough to be a pickpocket. What's the real reason?
You're right, it's none of your business. How about you keep your nose out of it?
You're right. They always get what they want, somehow. Fine. Tell Atar I'll sell.
You've got that right. Only a matter of time before we're roasted alive. Come on!
Your call. Might be safer to travel separately - attract less attention that way.
Your funeral. Someone else is gonna have to help you get him back in there again.
Yours was not an easy transformation. But you're still alive, so congratulations.

A Forsworn agent. Running loose in the city. The Jarl is going to hear about this.
A sensitive question. You may want to be careful broaching that subject with some.
A true Nord never fears death. It's the how and why of it that one needs consider.
Ah, don't you see? The names of dragons are always three Words of Power -- Shouts.
Ahraan. You wound me, Dovahkiin. I may not tell the whole truth, but I am no liar.
Alduin, Bane of Kings, ancient shadow unbound, with a hunger to swallow the world!
All right! I get it. I'll pay on time from now on. Just don't smash anything else.
All right! I knew you'd do it. This is going to be so fun. You can't even imagine!
And don't always just do what you're told. Nobody rules anybody in the Companions.
And now that they've solved their little pirate problem, they're busier than ever.
And what harm is there in letting a few legionnaires die in place of your own men?
Are you a hunter, by chance? The hills surrounding the village are ripe with game.
Arnleif and Sons Trading Company buys and sells anything you wandering types need.
Bah, I'm not afraid of anything out here. Walls are just a weakling's hiding spot.
Be brief Imperial, there's only so long I can stand being downwind of your stench.
Be careful, you might find more than just King Olaf's Verse in Dead Man's Respite.
Because the food and resources we get from the Empire are important to our people.
Been up to the Blue Palace? It's a sight to see. Even if it is filled with fops...
Better to work in the cold than in the heat, I say. Though some sun would be nice.
Beware of Frostmere Crypt, friend. Heard some bandits are living in the ruins now.
But at least I know where to start now. Thank you, you've been a great help to me.
But Boethiah's priest is imprisoned as well. But not by me. He is hurt. Suffering.
But he won't deal with me. Talk to him; see what it'll take to get my amulet back.
But his death was avenged long ago. You have taken more lives than honor demanded.
But I cannot go to it, not poor Septimus, for I... I have arisen beyond its grasp.
But I know things are said behind my back. Conversations cease when I enter rooms.
But thanks to the Blades, you now have questions that only Paarthurnax can answer.
But they're saying that one of them freed Ulfric... that he's in league with them.
Buying and selling a wide range of assorted goods! The best selection in Windhelm!
By leaving Elisif alive, Ulfric completes the separation of the Empire and Skyrim.
Can you just imagine how ancient this place must be? Hundreds of years? Thousands?
Can you spare a septim? Lost an eye during the Great War, or I'd earn it myself...
Cause trouble in Whiterun, and I'll haul you into the Dragonsreach dungeon myself.
Certainly nothing illicit going on here, Arch-Mage. You can be quite sure of that.
Dawnstar has always held its own against the bandits and wild animals of the Pale.
Did you see my husband already? I'm sorry... he can come off a bit rough at times.
Do what you will. Cicero has no fight left. In the end, Sithis will judge us both.
Do you believe all this talk of dragons? Can the ancient ones truly have returned?
Do you know my father? He's really important. He even talks to the Jarl sometimes.
Don't sound so disappointed. You wouldn't be allowed to take it even if there was.
Don't wait for me. Get to Korvanjund as soon as you're ready. I'll meet you there.
Dragonborn! Have you come to cleanse Sovngarde at long last of Alduin's foul mist?
Dragons have always been able to Shout. Language is intrinsic to their very being.
Everyone on me. Let's show these Imperial milk drinkers what true Nords look like!
Everything you see is grown at my family's own Hollyfrost Farm. Fresh and filling.
Falion had his work to keep him busy, and I needed somethin' to do. So, here I am.
Falkreath will be turned over to Ulfric, and Dengeir of Stuhn will return as Jarl.
Filthy natives. Get to work. We have meals to prepare and no time to prepare them!
Fine. Take them and be gone. Never return here, or else you'll face my full wrath.
Five. Our leader, Paarthurnax, lives alone on the peak of the Throat of the World.
Fool! Did you think Molag Bal, the Lord of Domination, would so easily reward you?
Forget wine, women and wealth - give me a calm sea and a good book, and I'm happy.
Fortunately, the quill required an ink with a unique formula known only to myself.
Fralia Gray-Mane is convinced that the Battle-Borns have abducted one of her sons.
Ghost or not, there are reminders of his dark rule that are best left buried away.
Go and watch the south road. Come find us if you see any Imperial soldiers coming.
Good to see you again! How would you like to hire a brave, if untested, mercenary?
Great work! Get back and report our success. I'll stay here and clean up the mess.
Guild Master, huh? Well, guess we could do worse. Better go see Brynjolf about it.
Gunnar, take care of the boy. I have to find General Tullius and join the defense.
Hadvar, did you really see a dragon? What did it look like? Did it have big teeth?
Hail, comrade! Shall we by clash of steel ease the gloom of the encompassing mist?
Have to admit, I'm attached to the place. Suppose that makes me crazy, doesn't it?
He's no longer abusing the power of the Eye. I would've expected all this to stop.
He's off fighting, Adara, with the Stormcloaks. He'll return when the war is over.
Help... ? No, no! Look I didn't even know it was her until after she contacted me.
Helping out Ainethach, huh? Give me a reason not to plunge a dagger in your chest.
Here, the humans rebel against their dragon overlords -- the legendary Dragon War.
Hmm? Oh, no. No, not really. I... Actually, I've forgotten what I was looking for.
Hmph. No arrows protruding from your skull... Can I assume Anoriath is dead, then?
How went your meeting with Ennodius Papius? Did you prove his paranoia legitimate?
Hurry! Before Alduin your life devours bring word to Shor's hall of our hard fate!
I can't believe we lost Markarth. Igmund's family has ruled there for generations.
I can't believe you're speaking to me, after what you've done. You broke my heart.
I care little about the politics and rivalries between the Thalmor and the Empire.
I expect a great deal of excitement in the city of Whiterun in the near future... 
I found a willing subject for you. Payment has already been discussed, of course. 
I grew up hearing songs about Eyldi the Bear! She wrestled a storm out of the sky!
I guess he's better at all that talking stuff anyway. I'd just mess everything up.
I guess I'll stay on the lookout. Keep your nose clean while you're here outsider.
I have a competitor called Honningbrew Meadery that I want to put out of business.
I hear even the simple jobs are becoming difficult. It never used to be like this.
I know all there is to know about the drinking of it, and that suits me just fine.
I know some of it looks like junk, but everything's a treasure in the right light.
I made it rather clear that a donation of 500 gold will clear it up rather neatly.
I probably shouldn't tell everyone who asks. This is important business, you know.
I see... and this [QUOTE]force of habit,[QUOTE] does it also compel you to murder?
I suppose we'll continue this at some later time, when we can avoid interruptions.
I thank you for this gift. The other Harbingers remain trapped by Hircine, though.
I tried to tell him that he wouldn't get past the traps, but he wouldn't listen...
I used to hate it here, but it's not so bad anymore. Constance is real good to us.
I wasn't born in Skyrim, but when I served in the Legion this land became my home.
I wasn't expecting to see you here! I assume you have your reasons. Everyone does.
I wonder what the ancient Nords did in these ruins. Unspeakable sacrifices, maybe?
I... I can only imagine Aela's anger. I'll make sure not to cross her for a while.
I'll sell just about anything, if it's worth my time. Keep that in mind, will you?
I'll tell you what. You help me get the treasure and I'll split it with you. Deal?
I'll work my spells and potions for whoever is willing to leave Dawnstar in peace.
I'm dying for a rest. I swear, I could lie down right now, and just sleep forever.
I'm married to Thonar Silver-Blood. Keep that in mind while you're speaking to me.
I'm not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher. What is it? What's Mercer Frey done?
I'm not sure I like these Alik'r warriors hiding out here. They seem like trouble.
I'm sorry to have to send you to Hjaalmarch. I can't stand the smell of it myself.
I'm sure you've heard of men who shift to beasts under the influence of the moons.
I've been trained as a skald, as was my father, and my father's father before him.
I've had yet another complaint. Please stop barging in on experiments in progress.
If it's a bed you need, talk to Keerava in the Bee and Barb. She'll set you right.
If that weapon causes problems for my customers, I cause problems for you. Got it?
If the Forsworn aren't attacking my town, the Nords are trying to force me off it.
If this is another dwarven trinket, I keep telling you I'm not familiar with them.
If you come across any Imperials in your travels, I expect you'll know what to do.
If you have any jewelry to sell, I'd be glad to pay you a fair sum in gold for it.
If you plant this in the vermin's nest, it should stop them from ever coming back.
If you see anything you like, just let me know and I'll glad offer you a discount.
If you want to lead this pack when I'm gone, you have to see farther. Look closer.
If you'd stop wasting your coin on that skooma, you'd have enough gold to live on.
If you'll check the shelves around the balcony, I'll check around the lower level.
If you've got some business in Rorikstead, you should start by speaking to Jouane.
In dark times friends bring light. This is for you. Thank you for your friendship.
Is this about the stables? With my husband gone, my son Horm handles the business.
It appears you were at least half-right. There is necromancy at the heart of this.
It is Ri'saad who owns the three trading caravans that travel the roads of Skyrim.
It's a good start, but you need all four of the volumes or the set isn't complete.
It's a little gift from the dwarves. Who knew they would end up helping our cause?
It's buried with its maker, Curalmil, in a long forsaken cave to the west of here.
It's from... Falk Firebeard at the Blue Palace? You've got friends in high places.
It's not hard to fit in and make friends when you have the coin to make it happen.
It's settled then. Brief as life can be in Skyrim, at least we'll have each other.
Its name is no accident. The palace was originally built to hold a captive dragon.
Keep turning down jobs like this and the Guild will begin to lose respect for you.
Kust is responsible for the cemetery here in Falkreath, I take care of the Shrine.
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la. La la la, la la la la la laaaaaahhhh...
Lead her to the Whiterun stables, outside of the city. We will wait for you there.
Let us not spurn our lord's bounty - this hall is his gift, for glory well-earned.
Let's try not to make too much noise. I've heard that cave-ins can start that way.
Look around you, I'm barely keeping this rathole together. The war's seen to that.
Look at her, rummaging through refuse. Wonder what she's lost... besides her mind.
Look for a way out! We are not going to burn to death in our own damned Sanctuary!
M'aiq is always in search of calipers, yet finds none. Where could they have gone?
M'aiq loves the people of Skyrim. Many interesting things they say to each other. 
Make yourself useful and chop up some firewood. There's a few coins in it for you.
Master Borri has agreed to teach you the first Word of a new Shout. Attend to him.
More of those things. Bah. Viola Giordano's been putting them all around the city.
Morrowind of course. Any Dunmer worth their weight in ash would tell you the same.
My food is the best in all of Skyrim; always as fresh as the day it was collected.
Near as I can tell, a bunch of ancient Nord hermits who live on top of a mountain.
No, no. I'm just a simple herbalist. You'll want to see Arcadia, over in Whiterun.
Nocturnal doesn't care about you, the Key or anything having to do with the Guild.
None may pass this perilous bridge 'til I judge them worthy by the warrior's test.
Not interested? Fine. Then let me offer it to someone with a little more backbone.
Not so sure? Oh, then perhaps we should take a moment to look around a little, eh?
Not until the Moot declares that title should adorn my shoulders will I accept it.
Not yet, no. But perhaps an intrepid person such as yourself could help with that.
Now get out of here and to the outpost! I need to know what's happening out there.
Now here is a face I did not expect to see. Be mindful, for you walk among adders.
Now it would seem Ulfric has his wish. And there truly is no justice in the world.
Now you I like. I've been getting sick of the pushovers that usually walk in here.
Now, I'm a busy man and your pointless questions are boring me terribly. Good day.
Nuz aan sul, fent alok, fod fin vul dovah nok, fen kos nahlot mahfaeraak ahrk ruz!
Oh come on, leave it alone. He's gone. There's no use in talking about it anymore.
Oh, I'm just a servant, dear. You want to talk to one of the Companions, I'm sure.
Oh. All right... I guess I'll just keep practicing on my own. Sorry to bother you.
Once that infernal lockbox is opened, he will have exhausted his usefulness to me.
Once you realize the Key can access these traits, the potential becomes limitless.
One moment we joked about what we'd find below, the next he'd been ripped in half.
One thing at a time. We're here for the Crown. Any of these carvings show a crown?
Onikaan koraav gein miraad. It is wise to recognize when you only have one choice.
Papa says that I shouldn't keep waiting. Why not? Mama has to come home some time.
Perhaps we can find some treasure if we search the grounds of the fort thoroughly.
Please exercise caution. This is not a procedure without possible... consequences.
Please, you can't tell anyone. It must remain a secret! I'll do whatever you want.
Punishment's too good for Mercer Frey. The only penalty for his betrayal is death.
Really? Perhaps the amulet is important somehow. Is there some way you can use it?
Riften has problems of its own. Now is not the time for exploration and discovery.
Rogatus and I have been married over 50 years. He's always been a bit of a grouch.
Roggi pawned a few of his things back when he still had things to pawn. Take them.
Sahrot Thu'um, med aan tuz, vey zeim hokoron pah, ol fin Dovahkiin komeyt ok rein!
Same thing we do with all the other natives who want to change things around here.
Say no more. I was wondering what you were doing here... I'm glad to play my part.
See that you do. You're an embarrassment, Horgeir. I don't know why I married you.
Seems Kolskeggr Mine got hit by Forsworn. Those madmen get more bold every season.
Send the word. [QUOTE]A new day is dawning and the sun rises over Whiterun.[QUOTE]
She's meticulous to a fault, and keeps a logbook with every transaction she makes.
She's the mistress of night and darkness and the patron of every thief in Tamriel.
So glad we kept you in Skyrim. Serving your Emperor was worth the wait, of course.
So sad what happened to young Elisif. Tragic really. Such a young and pretty girl.
So you're just one of Aren's lackeys? That's disappointing. You show real promise.
So... I've taken us this far, but you need to guide us the rest of the way. Drink.
Some fear our new resident wizard. As they grow to know him, they will accept him.
Some risks must be taken, to be sure. I am simply trying to avoid untimely deaths.
Someone actually interested in what I'm doing? Amazing! Well, allow me to explain.
Sorry, boss. Had to use your share to cover expenses after you done and got messy.
Stormcloaks, Imperials, dragons. Ain't no matter to me what I kill. Let them come.
Sure - take advantage of the guy in jail. Okay, fine. I can make the deal sweeter.
Take my advice and keep away. You look too smart to get caught up with this bunch.
Thane Bryling, what do you have to report about the state of Haafingar's defenses?
Thank you. I'll look these over, and inform Mirabelle if I find anything relevant.
That wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now, just up the road.
That's a decent enchantment. But keep studying, you've only scratched the surface.
That's a true Reachman. Hope he heads to Markarth to take out some of those Nords.
That's it then. After all of those years of helplessly watching the Guild decline.
That's it! That's the second Totem. Quickly, let's put it back with the other one.
That's just it... if she's not happy, there are plenty of other women who will be.
That's really not at the top of my list, no. Please, Camilla, I need you to focus.
The Aldmeri Dominion may have defeated the Empire, but it has not defeated Skyrim!
The Argonian sugar-cane wine? It's pretty hard to get around here. Very expensive.
The boy was good at sussing out secrets. You, I expect to take a more active role.
The Empire is weak. That is why we fight them. Skyrim must be ruled by the strong.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.
The eyes of Shor are upon you this day. Defeat Alduin, and destroy his soul-snare.
The Forsworn ambush our roads and dragons cloud the skies. Is there any good news?
The guards know who holds the purse strings in this city, and I don't like snoops.
The Imperials aren't going to leave us alone. They still have camps in the hills. 
The meals I serve ain't what I'd call a Jarl's feast, but they'll fill your belly.
The Silver-Bloods run nearly all the lands in this Hold, as well as the local inn.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.
The tome bears the likeness of Vaermina on the cover. It should be here somewhere.
The walls have ears and you're being tested, lad. We'll talk in the Ragged Flagon.
The World-Eater waits within the mist! Bring word to Shor's hall of our hard fate!
Their leader, Linwe, he's the worst of the lot. He steals valuables from the dead.
Then I thank Lady Mara with all my heart; for you, for our child and for our love.
There is only silence right now. Perhaps later we will hear one of the lost Words.
There you go. You may as well take Gunjar's gear. He won't be needing it any more.
There's hardly ever time to make the occasional delivery to the taverns of Skyrim.
There's no mistake. You're a wanted woman... and it's time to pay for your crimes.
There's probably something I could find for you to do, but best to check with him.
They sit up there in their tower, doing gods-know-what, and who watches over them?
They threw me in here until they were ready to use me in one of their experiments.
Things are much better now that Grelod is dead, but still. I'm sick of this place.
This is an important day for the Empire and for the Legion. And for all of Skyrim.
This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Brother here.
Turn my back on these people when their lives could be at stake? I should say not.
Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more than Torygg.
Unless you can find that crystal, there's no point in wasting more time with talk.
Until he found a way to string the extra courses, bards only had six course lutes.
Until you can find out whether Fjola is here there's nothing I care to to discuss.
Very good. But you've created a debt between us. Here. Take this. We are even now.
Wait, it's haunted? I don't like ghosts... let me think about this for a minute...
We can just sacrifice another disciple. Apprentice Haerlon will be no great waste.
We do not regret this loss. Dragonrend holds no place within the Way of the Voice.
We have a nice arrangement in this city, and we're not letting you get in the way.
We keep hearing that the war could come through here. I try not to worry about it.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle all the way in Winterhold.
Wealth is my business. Help me out and I can add to yours. Would you like a taste?
Welcome to Warmaiden's. Now you, my girl, have definitely come to the right place.
Well, keep at it. The fish have to get to know you before they're willing to bite.
Well... you probably should go collect it before someone else does, shouldn't you?
What do you mean? That wine tastes finer than anythin' Surilie Brothers ever made.
What? Oh, hardly! I don't think even Ulfric could pull a dragon out of his pocket.
Whatever you did, it worked. Let's see what else those old Blades left in our way.
When I meet Sarthis there, he's usually waiting for me outside with his bodyguard.
When I've finished what I'm working on, everyone will understand its significance.
When Mercer stole the Key, that conduit closed, severely limiting our ties to her.
When you are ready to rejoin the living, just bid me so, and I will send you back.
Whiterun once again belongs to its rightful heirs. It's a glorious day for Skyrim.
Why does Alduin hang back? We've staked everything on this plan of yours, old man.
Why hire a common soldier to protect you when you can have a master of the arcane?
Wise move. Now get out of here ya goat licker, before I decide the toll's gone up.
Working for Erikur may be below my stature, but the compensation is... acceptable.
Yes, I have. Adara made the rings herself. She is learning to bend the metal well.
You found me! Laelette was trying to find me too, but I'm glad you found me first.
You got guts walking around with that weapon out. Looking for a fight? Is that it?
You hear the news? There's a dragon roosting up on Mount Anthor, to the northwest.
You hope to gain in council what you've been unable to take in battle, is that it?
You look rather pale. Could be Ataxia. It's quite a problem back home in Cyrodiil.
You looking to buy some potions? Or maybe I could help train you to make your own?
You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords.
You two will just have to learn to get along until we can build you another house.
You'll wind up getting yourself killed. Dagur shouldn't have said a word about it.
You're not with the Thalmor Embassy, are you high elf? No, that can't be right....
You're passing through Solitude? Maybe you're looking to make some easy gold, yes?
You've done it! Now, if I can only remember what we were originally talking about.
Your arms and legs are fit for catching strong, agile prey. I could use your help.
[QUOTE]When the Dragonborn Ruler loses his throne, and the White Tower falls[QUOTE]
A letter... not sure who from. He wouldn't say. Just that he was a friend of yours.
A monk from the Psijic Order, here, after all these years, and then he just leaves.
Aela said that the cleansing used a head from one of the witches of Glenmoril, yes?
Aerin, I owe you my life. It would take a threat to all of Skyrim for me to depart.
After all, Eorlund works the Skyforge. How is any smith going to compete with that?
Ah! Dragonsreach! There are many difficulties, but I cannot think of a better plan.
Alduin komeyt tiid. What else would you seek? Alduin and Dovahkiin return together.
All right, but don't wander ahead too far or else we'll be forced to come find you.
All the food I could eat, all the wine I could drink and all the women I could bed.
Almost doesn't feel like Skyrim, being so far away from the rest of the world here.
Always good to see folk come back for more. You need a drink, you just let me know.
Am I sensing that you may be interested in gathering these rare ingredients for me?
Amazing that such beauty could exist in a place as desolate as the volcanic tundra.
An intelligent, beautiful woman like her wouldn't fall for that nonsense... I hope.
And finally, there's the matter of the Patronage that Elisif wanted me to give you.
And I advise you both to listen to what he has to say, before you do anything rash.
And I could absorb the spirit of poor, dead Barbas. He'd still be reunited with me.
And that we were sworn to protect the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer of all.
And, while you're at it, make a little bit of coin on the side. Not a bad deal, eh?
Animals in the Pale don't need a reason to attack Dawnstar. It's just their nature.
Apologies. But perhaps this isn't the time. I've never even heard of this outsider.
Aren't you already running a job for Aela? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
As long as I'm left alone to pursue my research, I don't care who gives the orders.
Atub is wise beyond her years. I take her advice seriously, and you should as well.
Auxiliary, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open.
Aventus Aretino. He was sent to live here after his mother died. He escaped. And...
Aye, there's always a catch. But at this point, I suppose there isn't much to lose.
Aye. Our Jarl would sure like to know if he did though. Might even pay to find out.
Back off, this action's all mine. No room for anyone else in the Guild on this one.
Be aware of rune traps on the ground or else this could be a very short expedition.
Bein' a thief is like a second skin for you, ain't it? Never seen anythin' like it.
Bryling's obsession with honor and tradition is quaint, but politically irrelevant.
But I digress. Here, take these. They need to be delivered to your, um... superior.
But we must have the support of the other Jarls for that claim to have any meaning.
Chops and steaks fit for a jarl! Come and see my selection of finest-quality meats!
Chops and steaks fit for a Jarl! Come and see my selection of finest-quality meats!
Damn it. The priests must have activated this barrier when the Miasma was released.
Dear sister, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting.
Don't look at me. I didn't kill her. I was just... making sure the body got buried.
Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin, naal ok zin los vahriin, wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal!
Excellent work. You have a true fighting spirit. Did that better than I could have.
Fair enough. Although I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're really on. Still...
Falk, you shouldn't have come. You know what'd happen if people found out about us.
Fear not. You'll have your trinkets, your desire for power, your hunger for wealth.
Fine! I'll just... leave the rest of it. Let's go, then, if you're in such a hurry.
First you take the job, now you don't even want it. I wish you'd make up your mind.
For a hundred lifetimes my heart has burned for revenge on Alduin too long delayed.
For now, I will maintain my ruse here. You are always welcome in the Bannered Mare.
Get the crown already. We don't need to hang around here any longer than necessary.
Get to Windhelm with the crown as quick as you can. Tell Ulfric he owes me a drink.
Good, then you understand why this is about more than just Mercer's lust for power.
Good. We still hold half of Skyrim despite everything the Empire could throw at us.
Ha. We admire your fighting spirit, Orc-Kin. You'll fit right in here. Come inside.
Halt. The Dwemer Museum isn't open to anyone without the court wizard's permission.
Have you ever been to Darkwater Crossing? Terrible name for such a beautiful place.
He he. Not just yet, Dorthe. I need to keep forging, and you need to keep watching.
He seeks information about the Eye, but what he will find shall be quite different.
He would dote on her so much. Let her work the forge and everything. I miss him so.
He's a bard, so he says. Occasionally he finds time to do his job here at the mill.
He's just waiting for the shipments, Lisbet. He'll be back as soon as they come in.
He's my son. I just... I feel it in my heart. You'd understand if you had children.
Here's to a long and prosperous future... may the Guild last another hundred years.
His request is denied... I'm not paying him any more gold. This madness has to end.
Honor may mean nothing to you, but it means much to me. Your apology, or your life.
How about drink? None of that local piss. Real Black-Briar Mead, fresh from Riften.
How... How do I know you're telling me the truth, and not just what I want to hear?
However, I did notice she was quite angry and it was being directed at Mercer Frey.
I can almost... hear them. I feel their life energy. Come, I will make the mixture.
I can promise you if it comes to that, and my back's to the wall, I won't hesitate.
I can see to that. We'll need plenty of fresh corpses to rebuild her army, you see.
I can tell you're a discriminating customer. Perhaps you're a wealthy one, too, hm?
I did. I was known as Ghorbash gro-Dushnikh in those days, in honor of my homeland.
I doubt the Thalmor are aware of you yet. So we should be safe from them, at least.
I had a medal. It had someone's face on it. I threw it away, after. It didn't help.
I have a decent mind for potions, but I've also learned how to craft magical items.
I have a lot to do around the farm, so make it quick please. What is it you wanted?
I hear you faced a dragon at Helgen and lived to tell about it. That ain't nothing.
I hope you will return to us soon with the news that justice has finally been done.
I just handed you the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. Does that make me Dragonborn, too?
I promise you, I'll never let this happen again! I'll seal this whole place away...
I really don't mean to be rude, but I don't think there's much I can help you with.
I shall guide you unto it. Find it and return here. And great shall be your reward.
I think if we had some of the sap from the parent tree, we could wake up its child.
I think you should finish that special assignment Delvin gave you, then we'll talk.
I understand. It just isn't me. I'm not a warrior and I don't think I ever will be.
I was actually just about to head on inside. Be good to have someone watch my back.
I wasn't sure your heart was in it. But you've proven me wrong. And I respect that.
I wish I had more contracts to dole out. You handled those jobs like a born killer.
I wish we could have absolved your brother-in-law of his sins before his execution.
I wonder what keeps these machines working so long after their masters disappeared.
I... I can hear you talking out there. Please, let me go. I've done nothing to you.
I'll tell you what... I'll play a special song, just for you, for no charge at all.
I'm a soldier, not a politician. And my personal beliefs are not yours to question.
I'm afraid not. There are preparations to make and Gallus's remains to lay to rest.
I'm fairly sure that the dragons don't care about our matters one way or the other.
I'm feeling a sense of inner peace... something I haven't felt in a very long time.
I'm glad you were able to correct your mistake. I'll release Wuunferth immediately.
I'm just a poor man trying to make a living. I'd leave Morthal were it in my power.
I'm sure when the time for promotions comes, they'll go to the most deserving mage.
I'm watching you, Grelka. One slip up and I report you to the guards. You got that?
I've been looking for you. Got something I'm supposed to deliver - your hands only.
I've been thinking... maybe Camilla needs a little help seeing Sven for what he is.
I've finally located Vokun's crypt! The scroll I'm looking for just has to be here.
If I were walking around with a wound, I would want you to tell me to see a doctor.
If it's all the same to you, Scouts-Many-Marshes prefers to eat and drink in peace.
If you don't mind king, we'll just be taking that crown of yours and be on our way.
If you need to sample some of the finest mead in Skyrim, you're in the right place.
If you really want to do my job for me... Here, I'll mark the location on your map.
If you want to know more, I'm sure you can find any number of tomes on the subject.
In any other circumstance, I'd agree with you. However, these aren't normal dreams.
In Morthal, there is little to rule. But there is much to teach. And so, I am Jarl.
Is this that dwarven city? I hear the treasure from their ruins is worth a fortune.
It also makes it easier to gather water when the canal is right out the front door.
It is none of your concern, I assure you. Just... Forget that you ever saw me here.
It was a suicide mission! Astrid said as much. Yet here you stand, hale and hearty.
It's an illegal substance highly favored by the Khajiit. Very difficult to come by.
Just as a bear climbs a tree to escape the hunt, but only ends up trapping himself.
Just make sure to take care of whatever's going on there. It's my name on the line.
Kill one of us, and three more will take their place. The Forsworn are unstoppable.
Kill one person, and you can solve so many problems. I wonder at the possibilities.
Let's get moving, I want to catch her inside while she's distracted. Take the lead.
Let's make sure I'm not forgetting anything. Clothes? Check. Beard? Check! Luggage?
Looking for a horse? I own these stables, but Skulvar can help you with a purchase.
Make it quick, but make it hurt. If you get caught by the guards, I don't know you.
Make sure to pull your bow all the way back to get the most power out of your shot.
Master, you're far too old for this sort of journey. We don't know what's inside...
More souls are needed for the Star. The last one died before he could be harvested.
Most of my kin are in the longhouse. Come back during the day if you wish to trade.
My apologies, Jarl Elisif. I was thinking only of the importance of the war effort.
My friend, you are very perceptive! I have a powerful thirst that cannot be slaked!
My husband handles the indoor work. Just as well - he'd only hurt himself out here.
My... talents... are useful here. I help maintain order, even if it goes unnoticed.
Need supplies? See Belethor at his store. Sleazy little man, but he has good stock.
No interest in being immortalized in song? Remembered and praised for all eternity?
No need to get so... hostile. Just take it. Sounds like you need it more than I do.
No one escapes. I thought keeping Madanach down there would keep him under control.
No. I think he was entirely wrong. Roggvir's execution was justified and necessary.
No. If we must fight, we will, and you will lead us to victory. As you always have.
Nords don't trust magic, or those that use it. Made it difficult for me growing up.
Not long ago it was my husband Eorlund. There was no finer smith in the nine holds.
Not today. You should have come by earlier. Wait, didn't I sell me last one to you?
Not well. He's convinced that his house is haunted, so he's sleeping on the street.
Now that dragons are coming back, our purpose is clear again. We need to stop them.
Now the Thalmor will be hunting me for the rest of my life. I hope it was worth it.
Oh, my dear Urag. You're trying so hard to help. I do hope you're not disappointed.
Oh, yes? We'll get to that, after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation.
Oh, yes. J'zargo hopes to find things that will make him a more powerful mage here.
Okay? The deal was already done, the thing just never showed up. I can't help that!
One day, you'll be forced to make a choice. And I hope it's the right one, brother.
Only thing better than ridin' a swift horse is ridin' a swift horse over the enemy.
Ooookay.... Um.... Let me see. Thistle? Yes, let's try that. Just a sprig or two...
Other than that, they seem like a quiet lot. Don't really know too much about them.
Our Chief, Yamarz, was once a strong and proud warrior. Now he is stricken, cursed.
People of Riften, heed my words. The return of the dragons is not mere coincidence.
Perhaps a silver necklace or a silver ring? Easy to wear and soft against the skin.
Perhaps only its creators ever knew it. But I am not the one to speak of it to you.
Perhaps. They could be nonsense... inane scribbles done by someone in idle boredom.
Please hurry. The Captain of the Guard isn't patient when it comes to tasting time.
Please tell me you flayed that horrible bard alive and made a drum from his skin...
Politics are something best avoided. I prefer more personal confrontations, myself.
Rarely in my travels have I encountered those who possess skills equal to your own.
Remember, nothing but genuine fire salts will do... the forge knows the difference.
Reyda was here, then gone. Went to gather plants and never came home... nope, nope.
See that you don't. I promised to keep you safe and I'm not going to break my word.
Serving in the Legion taught me to respect leadership. The stronghold needs Burguk.
Shor as well - he welcomes all heroes to his kingly hall, if we could but reach it.
Shut it, Kleppr. Thongvor isn't here, so save your kissing up for a Nord who cares.
Shut up. Only the gods can judge me. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?
Since you paid my fee recently, I suppose it's only fair that I join you once more.
Sinderion made it his life's work, developing all sorts of interesting concoctions.
Skyrim was betrayed, the blood of her sons spilled in doomed struggle against fate.
Slay him in the coldest of blood. Do not give him the dignity of defending himself.
So be it. The sons of Skyrim at least put the greater good above our own interests.
So you're willing to starve your wife and daughter to reclaim some rusty old sword?
So, what of the old beggar, Narfi? Is it done? Has he groveled for his last septim?
Stolen? How can you be certain? I may have just misplaced it somewhere in the city.
Strictly to cover damages, you understand. I believe 250 gold should be sufficient.
Ten septims tomorrow, baby Battle-Born. Or I'm gonna bloody your nose and your lip.
Thank you! We'll head back to work, right away. Take this, it's the least I can do.
That can have interesting results. Some victims may flee, others may cower in fear.
That he... that I'm...  that I don't have the same mother as my brother and sister.
That is where I learned to cook, and where I belong. Not here, with all these dogs.
That... wizard is still at the Inn. I can't believe Dagur allows him to stay there.
That's comforting. Glad they're keeping watch instead of getting rid of the draugr.
That's right! Don't worry, Uncle Ralof, I won't let those soldiers sneak up on you.
That's what I like to hear. I'll get the full report from Legate Rikke. Now then...
That's Whiterun up on the hill there. We'll be at the main gate before you know it.
The Agent of Subterfuge utilizes shadow to cloud the judgement of those around him.
The Argonians can't even live inside the walls. They're all stuck out on the docks.
The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps...
The College is the worst thing that's ever happened to Winterhold, maybe to Skyrim.
The Emperor of Skyrim. Dead. These are dark times, my friend. Dark times, indeed...
The final step is tricky. It requires the briar heart from a Forsworn of the Reach.
The Great War... only thirty years past and already ancient history to most people.
The North Wind is my mistress, and I'm her master. I don't tolerate any disloyalty.
The only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.
The walls have ears and you're being tested, lass. We'll talk in the Ragged Flagon.
Then it's decided. When this entire sorry affair is over, we'll handle the details.
Then my answer is the Hall of the Dead is closed. By order of the Jarl. Understand?
There is always work for the Companions. But there is more personal task before me.
There is peace now, and that peace will continue for as long as it suits our needs.
There's no need to be concerned. We've been through more difficult times than this.
They always try to take advantage of me. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile.
They were apparently under the impression we were keeping it in a closet somewhere.
They will sing of this battle in Shor's hall forever. But your fate lies elsewhere.
They're not the sort to take visitors, but I never go that high up the path anyway.
Think, please, just for a moment, about what he would do if he knew its true value.
This civil war is taking its toll on all of us. Miners are some of the hardest hit.
This is a local favorite and one of the first songs I ever learned. Ragnar the Red.
This is the Ring of Hircine. I was told it could let me control my transformations.
This mine is only a few years old, but I've been digging up ore for over a century.
This smell of dank earth and worm-eaten wood is going to make me lose my last meal.
Thongvor. I should have executed your whole treacherous clan when I had the chance.
Thorald did worse. He took action against the Empire, and the Battle-Borns knew it.
Those bears are making Miss Temba so angry. I hope you can do something about them.
Those that shrank from their destiny... well, you've never heard of them, have you?
Today I've cleaned the linens, washed the floors, and checked in on all our guests.
True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove his army's. 
Ulfric ordered us to stop fighting. Didn't want us all to die for nothing, I guess.
Ulfric, you can't seriously expect us to give up Markarth at the negotiating table.
Um... okay. Well, the boots aren't here yet. Hopefully on the next Khajiit caravan.
Unblooded, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open.
Unfortunate. He was an excellent sparring partner. I'll miss our training sessions.
Used to be a good-sized town, but folks have been moving to Riften for a while now.
Very well. I'll do the oath later. Let's just get 'em geared up and ready to fight.
We believe she may be hiding in Whiterun, but we're checking everywhere to be sure.
We discovered recently that I am with child. I'll need to stop working next season.
We honor the bravest fighters, but I have seen many types of bravery in my travels.
We kill every Thalmor between us and Thorald, and we bring him out alive. Let's go.
We're gathering for our final assault on Windhelm. Report to our camp in Eastmarch.
Welcome to the College of Winterhold. I am Faralda, one of the senior Wizards here.
Welcome. I don't believe we've met. I am Elenwen, the Thalmor Ambassador to Skyrim.
Well, it could be worse. The former steward, Proventus, kept very detailed records.
Well, look at you, thanks. Take it to Voada, she handles all the dogs for the Jarl.
Well, not that they would. They seem peaceful, but I wouldn't want to provoke them.
Well, then. You made it, safe and sound. Good. Come on, I have a place we can talk.
What kind of talk is this? The man I married would never speak of leaving his home.
What? Oh! How could I have possibly forgotten. Your reward, of course... of course.
What's the point in protecting this place if the mine's completely useless? Idiots.
When I tell you to, try and hit each of the three closest targets in eight seconds.
When the Stormcloaks took control of Whiterun, it was a victory for all true Nords.
When we go back to Largashbur we'll be kings. I like Narzulbur, but don't tell Mul.
When you get to be my age, you'll come to miss the smell of blood. Strange, I know.
Within these walls, I have all that I need to brew a potion for nearly any ailment.
Would it kill you to let a man go about his business in peace? Really, the nerve...
Yamarz betrayed us all. I will never allow that to happen again, so long as I rule.
Yes, I know just what you mean. My toes are numb from the cold more often than not.
Yes! I like the way you think. There are whispers of where we might find one, too. 
Yes. My older brother and the person you probably want to be speaking to right now.
You can use the North Gate to enter the city, or you can hit the road. Your choice.
You cut these bindings this minute! You hear me? You cut these bindings right now! 
You freed Svaknir, a fool of a poet, but an honest enemy who has earned my respect.
You just going to stand there, gawking? Go away. You're starting to... frighten me.
You just worry about fulfilling the contract. I'll take care of things on this end.
You know where to find me when you change your mind. Because you will. You have to.
You may have picked up the weapons of my ancient foes, but you are not their equal!
You said the ceremony was going to be at Morvunskar. Don't forget you still owe me!
You should be glad enough of a chance to lick your wounds at this point in the war.
You want my advice? Pay your debt to Vex quickly and she'll forget the whole thing.
You... you're the Harbinger. Of the Companions. It is my honor to stand before you.
You'd better come inside. Quickly now. Thalmor agents have been seen in the Ratway.
You'd better know how to use that weapon if you plan on swinging it around in here.
You'd require the Jarl's cooperation, of course. That might not be easy to come by.
You've broken the Code of Malacath. Your choice - pay with your blood or your gold.
[QUOTE]Night of Tears[QUOTE], eh? I remember this one. Well, isn't that interesting.
A god? Assuredly not! When was the last time you saw evidence of Aedra in the world?
A law made at the tip of an Aldmeri sword, aye. A sword stained red with Nord blood.
A Thane of Riften is expected to maintain permanent residence within the city walls.
Again, you have to think differently. Haven't you ever noticed how our luck behaves?
Ah yes, good idea. Best to let a professional businessman handle that money for you.
Ah, back from Fort Graymoor. The old servant has been put out of her misery, I hope?
Ah, splendid! Our fine city has a proud history, and I'm happy to share what I know.
Ah, the nectar of the gods! If there's ever anything I can do for you, just name it!
Ainethach needs to get rid of those Silver-Blood. Then maybe we can go back to work.
Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true, we're all doomed anyway.
All hail to Ulfric! You are the High King! In your great honor we drink and we sing.
All the miners, farmers, and laborers in the Reach get their daily wages through us.
All this talk of dragons returning to the world makes me more than a little nervous.
Already did. Part of the reason I'm living out here now. Thanks for offering though.
Alvor? The smith, isn't he? Reliable, solid fellow. Not prone to flights of fancy...
And what about you, Brother Casimir? Are you prepared to serve the will of Vaermina?
And you'd have me do what, join the College and prance about casting spells all day?
Arcturus took some men deeper in, wanted to be sure. We should maybe... assist them.
Are you looking to work? The mines are nearby. You bring me ore, I'll give you coin.
Aren't you already running a job for Skjor? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
As I promised, my men stand ready. The great chains are oiled. We wait on your word.
As if I would write this dribble. How about we play a bit of turnabout with Faendal?
Azura's Star. A Daedric artifact that allows any number of souls to pass through it.
Back for more? Since we had so much fun the last time, I'll join you free of charge.
Been hoping they'd make me a guard, but not yet. Still, I'll help them out if I can.
Before I'm goin' to give you any more work, you need to finish that job in Solitude.
Being an admirer, I'm sure you can appreciate the need to keep my research a secret.
Best not go wandering east of the city. Bandits been seen around Broken Helm Hollow.
Bottles of Moon Sugar. Khajiit use it as a... pick me up. Good way to pass the time.
Bountiful. Although I would like to have anchored a bit closer to Goldenglow Estate.
But she is to observe, nothing more. We are not negotiating with her, is that clear?
But the world is a dangerous place. Erik has no idea what he's getting himself into.
But what you seek does not come easily, and can destroy those without a strong will.
By cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country whole again!
By helping me, you're helping the good folk of Whiterun. How could I say no to that?
Can't blame you for having better things to do than help some farmer you don't know.
Can't say I mind the sight of all the Imperial guards. It's a change for the better.
Certainly a few of my colleagues aren't quite as talented as they'd like to believe.
Dear brother, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting.
Did you notice that the snow settles in a different direction near the murder sites?
Dirge told me you made it into the Guild. You need dirt on anything, you talk to me.
Do not mistake our life for one of stupidity. It would be the last mistake you make.
Don't get smart with me. I'm in charge. You keep it up, I'll have your toes cut off.
Don't go stopping for a nap. If you fall asleep in this place, you'll never wake up.
Eirid and I are playing Hunt the Elf. It's my job to find the Elf, and kill it dead.
Every time I think of you, I imagine a Saber Cat closing its claws around your face.
Exactly! And now I have to stare at these bars for eight months. Can you believe it?
Fell off the top of the cliff after a drunken party with the priestesses of Dibella.
Filthy creatures, aren't they? Living in the darkness, like they do. So uncivilized.
Flee from my sight, Dunmer, or I'll have you shipped back to Vvardenfell in a crate.
Go, seek your fate. I will be watching, and perhaps we will meet again - afterwards.
Gods, it's cold. They'd better find something good in there to make this worthwhile.
Good, just remember the order: do job first, get drunk second. Now take this and go.
Good. Can't have the buyer getting impatient and looking elsewhere for this, can we?
Good. You're here. I'll place the pieces on the altar, and Dagon should speak to us.
Grab everything important and let's move! Dragon's burning everything to the ground!
Great, another ambitious visitor. You think you can just wander in here and join us?
Guide my light through the temple to open the inner sanctum and destroy the defiler.
Ha! Remarkable! Well, the old bastard certainly made it worth your while, didn't he?
Ha! Why you are, silly! You are the Listener! You are the Listener! Such a kidder...
Haldyn will take my hide for this, but Skyrim's been feeling a bit confining lately.
Have you ever heard of such a thing? A Shout that can knock a dragon out of the sky?
He didn't like the Arch-Mage. Hated dealing with him, hated having to answer to him.
Her name is Muiri. I need you to talk to her, set up the contract, and carry it out.
Here to be a Companion? Well, they just let me in, so there's probably no more room.
Here. Let me show you some of the things the temple healers taught me about potions.
Hmm... that looks like some kind of claw from a statue. I wonder what it's used for.
Humph. That's only a problem for people who can't afford to hire their own security.
I am a traveler. A pilgrim. I follow the voice of Kynareth wherever it can be heard.
I am quite content to see nearly any aspect of magic explored and investigated here.
I can assure you that this is entirely false. We are fully in control of everything.
I can teach you, but I won't be held responsible for what you do with the knowledge.
I can tell you're no stranger to the wilds. I'm sure we can meet your hunting needs.
I can't believe it's over. Twenty-five years in exile and just like that, it's done.
I can't believe the mess Kleppr left things in. I have twice the work with him gone.
I couldn't be more proud to be a part of the Thieves Guild, or its new Guild Master.
I don't know if I can stand the abuse here much longer. They treat us like outcasts.
I don't know. I never expected the old bag to follow me so far. Just get rid of him.
I don't think so, Madena. There will be no deserters in this hold, and that's final.
I feel so helpless out here. The people of Riften depended on me, and I failed them.
I had hoped life would be simpler here, but war seems to find a way of following me.
I hardly think the bears are clever enough to hold a grudge against you, Miss Temba.
I have made it quite clear that my only role here is as an advisor to the Arch-Mage.
I have no time for Marla or Mara or whatever her name is... there's work to be done!
I help my mother Arob with the hunt. We bring much meat and skins to the stronghold.
I hope the Empire is sending reinforcements to drive these heathens out of Whiterun.
I lost my own daughter to the Imperial dogs, and by Talos I'll not lose anyone else!
I really don't mean to be rude, friend, but I'm not feeling particularly sociable...
I think my parents reserved a spot for me here at the College on the day I was born.
I thought I was clear regarding the dangers that awaited you within the Dreamstride.
I try and take comfort in knowing that when all is lost, there is much to be gained.
I used to travel so much before all this Forsworn nonsense. Such an inconvenience...
I was a little scared at first, but I like having my sister around. It's comforting.
I worship Peryite, yes, because sometimes the world can only be cleansed by disease.
I write drama, friend. The legends and history of Skyrim made to excite and inspire.
I'll speak to the Jarl and see what I can do. Just keep them at bay a little longer.
I'm a busy man. Half this city works for my family, and I have to keep them in line.
I'm a married man! Hey, where should we live? I guess you could always stay with me.
I'm not surprised you've never heard of it. Even I used to think it was just a myth.
I'm proud of my farm. It takes no small effort to grow crops in this part of Skyrim.
I'm sure my brother Vignar is, since they made him Jarl after throwing Balgruuf out.
I'm sure some of the locals can point you in the right direction once you get there.
I've been all across Tamriel. I've seen plenty of things just as outlandish as this.
I've got nothing against it, but for me, the promise of coin is what feeds my blade.
If by [QUOTE]work[QUOTE] you mean [QUOTE]testing your steel in bloody battle.[QUOTE]
If I make it back to Solitude, I'll put in a good word for you with General Tullius.
If there are any problems, let me know. It's my job to keep things running smoothly.
If Ulfric gets his hand on that crown, it won't be a fairy tale. It'll be a problem.
If you're looking to get a drink, Candlehearth Hall's got warm fires and strong ale.
If you're one of the Jarl's men, you'll get your lumber. Anga's Mill pays its debts.
If you're sympathetic to the Empire, you'll be wise to put Falkreath far behind you.
Impressive work. We started the attack once you made the fog scamper away like that.
Is that confidence I hear... or is it arrogance? Strange how often they're confused.
Is that confidence, or bravado? Confidence I can use. Bravado gets soldiers killed. 
It shapes worlds, creates and destroys life... It deserves proper respect and study.
It should be quite the affair. Nice to have something happy in the midst of the war.
It took so long. So very long. But now that you're here, you can accept my contract.
It was my pleasure. It's not often I get visitors out here. Let alone friendly ones.
It was so lucrative, I was considering moving the Guild to Solitude to save us time.
It wasn't easy getting all your things. A few guards had to have their throats slit.
It'll be lean times for the Reach with a Silver-Blood ruling it, that's for certain.
It's hard work keeping Solitude fed, but I wouldn't trust any other family to do it.
It's never been an issue. People say you helped with the problems at Wolfskull Cave.
Just try to relax, Veezara. Let the elixir do its work. You'll feel better, shortly.
Kill any intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need it. But let no one through.
Let this day be a final warning to all who would still call themselves Stormcloaks. 
Life's hard enough with all these men propositioning me. But that bard is the worst.
Look, we've got to deal with this situation. You've got to deal with this situation.
Mama doesn't like me jumping up and down in the house, but I can't help it. I swear.
Master Borri will teach you [QUOTE]Wuld,[QUOTE] which means [QUOTE]Whirlwind.[QUOTE]
Masters Einarth, Borri, and Wulfgar will each demonstrate a Shout. Make your choice.
Mind my words or I'll mind them for you: I'm slave to no man, no god, and no Daedra.
My boy's to grow up without a mother? What life is that? It's not right, I tell you.
My original intention was to use that arrow on Mercer, but I never had a clear shot.
Name's Ennis. If you've got friends who do business in Whiterun, they might know me.
Never mind your mother, Hreinn. You listen to me, and you'll be a great man one day.
No shade are you, as usually here passes, but living, you dare the land of the dead.
No, no. Sorry if I sounded so mean there. My brother always said I have a big mouth.
No, without Ranmir around we're running out of stock far less often than we used to.
No. This is my land. You expect me to just hand it over to those Silver-Blood thugs?
No... please, you have to help me! You don't understand what they do to people here!
Not a damn thing. I was just as surprised as you to find that big black dragon here.
Not many would walk blindly into a crypt, smelling of steel and blood, but not fear.
Not too much farther now. Kynesgrove is just down the road to the southeast of here.
Not with all those soldiers all over the hold. Their horses can't see you, you know.
Now do whatever it is you need to do, and let's get going before we miss our chance!
Now then. I hope you have something nice to wear. Because you're going to a wedding.
Now, I really got to get back to the body. Lot of work to prepare her for the grave.
Of course it has. Would you expect any less of me? Here, this is your half, my love.
Of course not! Complacency is the bane of art. They're in good hands with you, Inge.
Of course they have! I've made no secret of my loyalty to the Empire. I'm no coward.
Of course. I should've known. This was all Avulstein's idea, wasn't it? Where is he?
Of course. Ulfric's cause is just. It's time for Skyrim to rid itself of the Empire.
Oh Jon, stop dallying. You know you have to go. It's why Mara put you on this earth.
Oh, right. Oh, well, things are going well enough. At least, as well as we can hope.
Oh, Sayma would have my hide if I even suggested I might step foot on a battlefield.
Oh, we do all right. Rumor is, you had a hand in the Blackblood Marauders' demise...
Old Arnleif would be proud of Lisbet. She's kept this place running, thick and thin.
One day the war will end and the true heirs of Skyrim will inherit this great realm.
Out of my way. The son of the Jarl has no time for idle conversation with travelers.
Perhaps I'll ask Tolfdir what really happened. I understand he was here at the time.
Perhaps not. But this Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again.
Perhaps we can find a way for both of us to prosper from this unfortunate discovery?
Please refrain from practicing Conjuration spells in view of the town of Winterhold.
Qostiid sahlo aak. Just because you can do a thing, does not always mean you should.
Radiant Raiment has the finest attire in all of Skyrim. That is how we get business.
Roggvir always talked about his honor. Seems to me honorable men don't get executed.
Sabjorn keeps that locked up tight. If you can get through that way, go right ahead.
She does, my lady. But apparently, she hates you just a little less than the others.
Sift through the ashes that others are too fearful to touch. See what they tell you.
Since my customers are mostly local, I just knock on their front doors the next day.
Snilf, I told you begging isn't the answer. I expect to see you at the temple later.
So be it. Tell Ulfric and General Tullius that the Greybeards wish to speak to them.
So much energy... So much power. Never in my life have I seen something like this...
So we send in Vex and find out he's hired a bunch of mercenaries to guard the place.
So, they're making you leader, huh? Better go find Brynjolf so he can seal the deal.
Solitude is as glorious as they said it was. Nothing like Falkreath where I grew up.
Sometimes I feel like Annekke cares more about finding new rocks than being with me.
Sorry, I didn't mean to get carried away. There we go, one cup of diced horker meat.
Stay warm and keep sober. It's the two things I know for sure will make life better.
Still have quite a good bit of jobs available if you're looking for some extra coin.
Stop. Please. I don't know anything else. Don't you think I'd have told you already?
Sure, I used to be a soldier... but that was child's play compared to cracking rock.
Take a good look around you! Have you ever see the Guild in such a prosperous state?
Talos the mighty! Talos the unerring! Talos the unassailable! To you we give praise!
Talos, who in life was known as Tiber Septim, united Tamriel and founded the Empire.
Tell you what - you bring back my goat, and maybe I'll give a damn about your staff.
Thank you so much, this scroll means a lot to my family. Take this for your trouble.
The Blades are wise not to trust me. Onikaan ni ov. I would not trust another dovah.
The College has had enough trouble staying out of the war. No need to make it worse.
The Jarl needs to know if there's a dragon on the loose. Riverwood is defenseless...
The last thing I need is you blundering into a trap and warning her that we're here.
The mill is my responsibility, and that's what I care about. That's all. Understand?
The mine will be the talk of Skyrim soon, you'll see. It'll be the stuff of legends.
The most dangerous sort of man -- quick to anger, but patient in exacting vengeance.
The old tales say that he can travel into Sovngarde to devour the souls of the dead.
The package was heavy... I needed his help getting it on his horse. What was inside?
The path to Paarthurnax lies through this gate. I will show you how to open the way.
The way this war is going you'll soon have plenty of veterans like me to buy drinks.
The Winking Skeever's got warm beds and cold mead. You look like you could use both.
The... the books? Oh, I see. I thought perhaps... Well, I thought you'd come for me.
There was no murder! Ulfric challenged Torygg. He beat the High King in fair combat.
There's a gorgeous tree that grows right up through a cave to the northeast of here.
They say the Greybeards taught it to ignore the sun, and heat simply washes over it.
They were worshippers of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Lord of Destruction and Change.
This is Kynesgrove. Not much to look at. Let's see if we can find that dragon mound.
This is not the time for talk. Let's get to the Underforge and see what this can do.
To think, my ancestors destroyed the homes of Onmund's ancestors. So much bloodshed.
Unless you intend to bury someone this isn't the place you're looking for, traveler.
Watch the walls for the sphere constructs... they can appear in the blink of an eye.
We are turning the city over to Brunwulf Free-Winter, an honorable and faithful man.
We make easy pickings for thieves looking to steal everything we worked so hard for.
We must leave. Your father will never approve of us, and I grow weary of this place.
We'll pay whatever it takes. But we must have more swords for the Imperial soldiers.
We're looking for a book of alchemical recipes called [QUOTE]The Dreamstride.[QUOTE]
We're ready to march on Solitude, but the Emperor's visiting! The goddamned Emperor!
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle right here in Whiterun Hold.
Welcome to Kynesgrove. If you want to do business here, you'll have to deal with me.
Well, it's a... minor stain on the College's reputation. One of many, unfortunately.
Well, she's dead. But I guess that's not unusual, at least not for somebody in here.
Well? Where the hell are those damned Stormcloaks? Let's get this over with already.
What do you hope to find? Sweets and my dolly? Or maybe some of my spare Nightshade?
What? No! No, you don't understand! There's been some kind of mistake! I... Aggghhh!
What? You see a man fallen on hard times, and you think he's been like that forever?
When are you gonna do somethin' to help Falion? Stop people sayin' things about him?
When I told him there was no more Honningbrew, that he'd drank it all, he got angry.
When we step into battle, we fight for our own name, and the name of the Companions.
When you broke up the binding Potema escaped. We've encountered some of her minions.
Where else would I want to be but here? Learning from them, fighting at their sides.
Why do soldiers bother with target practice? One learns best by hitting real people.
Wonder what it's like for those Thalmor, now that they've been taken down a notch...
Yes, absolutely. Your skill is your own... don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise.
Yes, I just thought perhaps you'd have, err, come across something like this before.
You did? We were waiting for the Jarl to send an entire regiment to clear that mine.
You help my people and purchase a house from my steward, and I'll make you my Thane.
You kept your cool and you didn't kill him. That's the mark of a professional thief.
You need to report that crazy jester to the guard. He should be patrolling the road.
You now have the opportunity to maintain your College, and carry on with your lives.
You really don't remember stealing a goat and selling her to a Giant? Are you thick?
You strike your metal like a new mother giving her babe a light slap. Hit it harder.
You stupid lizard! I said give me some more drink, or I'll have your head on a pike!
You survived Helgen, so you have more experience with dragons than anyone else here.
You tell anyone that I told you, and I'll fry you from the inside out. Got it? Good.
You there, hold! If you are a true friend to Skyrim, you will help me in my mission.
You touch her, and I swear it'll be your fingers that go missing, you stupid Breton!
You will not disrespect Jarl Idgrod while in this Hall. Do we have an understanding?
You with one of the trade caravans, Khajiit? Your kind always seems to find trouble.
You'd better find that chest that fell off the boat or Gulum-Ei will have your hide!
You're damned right it does. I'll never breed another prize-winning goat like Gleda!
You're new here, right? Welcome to the Bards College. It's like a... musical museum.
You're not actually... picking my pocket? Well, you've got guts. I'll give you that.
You're not the first person to come in here asking about him, either, so be careful.
You've got a lot of nerve, walking around here dressed like an Imperial Legionnaire.
You've got the heart of Mara herself, you know that? Thank you, Carlotta. Thank you.
Ysgramor himself wouldn't have the patience to deal with all the rabble around here.
[QUOTE]Everyone will see it![QUOTE] she said. Of course! That was my problem with it.
A legendary bottle, forged in the days when Skyrim was just starting its turn to ice.
Addvild's made me a happy woman. I wouldn't want to be with anyone else in the world.
Agh... so bored! Only one fight in the last few weeks? This is gonna' drive me crazy.
Ah, indeed? The Jarl... Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons.
Ah, the sound of clinking coins. Even better, the sound of clinking coins in my hand!
Ah! Oh, by Kyne you startled me. There's a necromancer around here so watch yourself.
Ahrk fin zul, rok drey kod, nau tol morokei frod, rul lot Taazokaan motaad voth kein!
All it would take is a small force of guard to go into the Ratway and flush them out.
Alms. I said [QUOTE]alms[QUOTE] you backbiter. Give a crippled worker a helping hand.
Alright. I believe you. You aren't the first to turn away from the Empire in disgust.
Although Ulfric's court wizard has been known to take on apprentices once in a while.
And guess who gets to run the Black-Briar Meadery in Whiterun? You're looking at him.
And I think we'd both agree, Cicero's brought quite enough madness to this Sanctuary.
And if she decides to leave Ivarstead, what then? No, no... I can't bear the thought.
And that's it. I certainly think you deserve the first copy of the tome. Use it well!
And you. A Stormcloak? I'd thought better of you. You'll all come to regret this day.
Anuriel seems to think that seeing me on the streets might bolster the city's morale.
Any day is a good one, long as I don't have to go into town. But with Hjorunn gone...
Anything, anything at all would be a start. Then we can figure out how to get to him.
Are you complaining? Work. If you have strength to whine, you have strength to smelt.
Are you daft? I told you not kill any of them. How much clearer do you need me to be?
Aren't you already running a job for Farkas? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
Aren't you already running a job for Vilkas? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
As do I. That man saved my life. I hope that someone helps him, as he once helped me.
As long as he keeps paying, I suppose. He keeps to himself, and isn't hurting anyone.
As soon as we drive the Empire out of Skyrim, the dragons will vanish. Mark my words.
Before we depart, Brynjolf has some business to discuss. I suggest you listen to him.
Besides, you have your own score to settle with the Empire now. And with that dragon.
Bottom line - respect your Family. Do that, and everything else will fall into place.
Brother Thorek, we must remain here and guard this Skull with our lives if necessary.
Brothers and sisters of the Circle, today we welcome a new soul into our mortal fold.
But I wonder... would you suffer an old man a few more words before the deed is done?
But I've heard from the Snow-Shods that they intend to burn this place to the ground!
But more importantly, I am a daughter of Skyrim and wish to see her made whole again.
But you are that man, Ulfric.  You've been that man before, and you'll be him again. 
Clean the rooms yourself Kleppr. It's not like you do anything important around here.
Congratulations, brother. You've been living in Skyrim so long, you've become a Nord.
Creature like that'll make a man think long and hard about what he wants out of life.
Damn fool parading around with your weapon out. You planning on hurting someone, huh?
Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy.
Don't think you'll get special treatment just because you have a house in the city...
Don't worry about him. I know you work hard, and I'm the one who gets you your money.
Edda, Edda. There's no need for this. Just come by the temple and we'll care for you.
Either way, the trick was in the escape, and that's where my strengths came in handy.
Falkreath will be returned to Imperial control, under the authority of Jarl Siddgeir.
Falling in with either would threaten to draw much unwanted attention to our College.
Fine, but you're not gettin' any wealthier by weaslin' out of everythin' I offer you.
First, we're mounting an attack on the Fort. We aim to confiscate it from the rebels.
Get yourself a weapon. I'm going to need your help if we run into any more Imperials.
Good, I'll contact some of my people and have them prepare some shipments right away.
Great! Now I'm going to cast some spells at you. Keep your ward up so I can study it.
Hafnar was covered in blood, but his stupid Nord pride wouldn't let him admit defeat.
He seemed convinced that she'd run off with someone named Vex. That's all I remember.
He's so afraid to talk to me he's sending you to do it? I should've expected as much.
Help Irileth kill this dragon before it can attack Whiterun. There's no time to lose.
Here's your reward, as promised. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to work.
Hmm. I can't say I've any idea what they were up to. Have you found this observatory?
Hold, on there. I think I just remembered something. The last time we handed out pay.
How can Karliah remain so calm when Mercer had her on the run for that long? Amazing.
How much of our money have you spent today, Ranmir? Anything left, or is it all gone?
I am. I'd be glad to stand by your side until the Divines take us, if you'll have me.
I believe it should indicate how to enter the blocked off sections of the stronghold.
I call upon you Lady Nocturnal, Queen of Murk and Empress of Shadow... hear my voice!
I can also provide a few supplies useful to our trade now and again, for a small fee.
I can show you a few things, but anyone asks, and my name never comes up. Understand?
I dare Mercer to come back here! He sets one foot in the cistern and I'll cut it off!
I don't care what it is, I want it down now! I want to know what he's doing in there!
I don't care... We're going all the way in. I want to know what Shalidor hid in here.
I don't know. If the Augur suggested it, there must be a good reason for locating it.
I don't want to be responsible for sending you to your death. Be careful in the mine.
I guess you don't hear too well. I never heard of this [QUOTE]friend[QUOTE] of yours.
I had a dream that there was a good dragon. He was old and gray, but he wasn't scary.
I hadn't really considered it in terms of time. I suppose it's been at least a month.
I have responsibilities to attend to. We'll continue this discussion some other time.
I hope for all your sakes you find out who's behind this supposed [QUOTE]plot.[QUOTE]
I hope there's more bandits around... their numbers could use a little more thinning.
I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of surveying the site of the reception.
I made a split second decision to get you out of the way and it prevented your death.
I might well ask the same of you, running around by yourself in this dangerous place.
I see. Well, should you change your mind, the contract will be available for a while.
I should think so! I'm well used to taking care of a house and the folk living in it.
I suppose we shouldn't be surprised. They've never had many problems with the Empire.
I thought she'd have realized it's hopeless by now. I tried to tell her, years ago...
I trust you, I'm just concerned about her safety. That's all. Don't be angry with me.
I was a little scared at first, but I like having my brother around. It's comforting.
I work the forge, with my mother Gharol. We mine our own ore and shape our own metal.
I... I'm sorry, dear, I've got some other customers. I'll be back around in a minute.
I'd advise you all to trust in the strength of your sword arm over tales and legends.
I'd rather spend the gold on a new litter of pups, but the horses bring in more gold.
I'd thank the gods, but I'll settle for thanking you. Here's some coin for your help.
I'll bet some of these artifacts would fetch a good price. I hope they're not cursed.
I'll bet this is better than trying to grow something in Morrowind, though, isn't it?
I'll get back to the Bannered Mare soon enough. Just need to stretch my legs a bit...
I'll get word for him to meet you in Solitude, at the Winking Skeever -- you know it?
I'm afraid I must intrude. It is urgent that I speak with your associate immediately.
I'm glad you're here. I think some of these people are beginning to suspect who I am.
I'm going... as fast... as I can, you stupid she-devil. I don't see you... helping...
I'm on my way to Solitude to join the Legion. A united Empire is better for everyone.
I'm sorry mother, now that he's dead, I just want to know everything I can about him.
I'm sorry to always be so hard on you, boy. I just worry I don't have much time left.
I've half a mind to grab a pickaxe and start digging. Never know what you might find.
I've heard that miners sometimes die from poisonous gases trapped beneath the ground.
I've told you where Sky Haven Temple is. I'll trust you to get us there in one piece.
I've used my key, but the vault's still locked up tighter than a drum. Now use yours.
If only I could be free of the mundane, day-to-day activities life so often requires.
If Ulfric had his way, anyone who wasn't a Nord would be shipped right out of Skyrim.
If you have anything you're having a hard time selling, I can take it off your hands.
If you want to make the most of your investment, you'll come here to sell your goods.
If you're trying to ask if I tend the hall of the dead alone, then the answer is yes.
Is that Lady Mara's amulet? I'm shocked a fine person like you isn't married already.
It exists. And it'll be the symbol of the righteousness of our cause. Think about it.
It is good that you were willing to help J'zargo. This will not be forgotten, friend.
It sounded like they were heading there, though they were rather secretive about why.
It's none of your concern. All you need to know is that we're paying for information.
It's the only outsider Gallus trusted with the knowledge of his Nightingale identity.
It's true. Wasn't much of a thief though. Made enough noise to wake the Red Mountain.
It's what I do. I make things happen from behind the scenes. After all, here you are.
It's where people in the city are buried. Fathers. Forefathers. Mothers. Foremothers.
Jarl Igmund can refuse to see me all he wants. The Silver-Blood family will be heard.
Just don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.
Keep the guard alert. I want to make sure no townspeople get hurt if there's trouble.
Last thing the Black-Briars need is some loudmouth tryin' to meddle in their affairs.
Leather? If they're armored, you should talk to Balimund over at The Scorched Hammer.
Let me put the pieces on the altar. We'll see if Mehrunes Dagon can still be reached.
Like some horrible monster was turned inside out, and then exploded. What did you do?
Look, friend, if you think you can do better than the legion of guards, be my guest. 
Looking for shipping? We'll always offer better service than the East Empire Company.
Madesi, why don't you just take a bed here? There's no need to sleep in Beggar's Row.
Maven looked the other way as long as the honey kept flowing and we kept him in line.
Maybe I'll show you one day, Madesi. Have them delivered to the Bunkhouse, won't you?
More settlements have sent riders to say dragons are being spotted throughout Skyrim.
Mother, how long must we put up with Saerlund spouting his nonsense about the Empire?
My Eorlund is the finest blacksmith in Skyrim, and that's not just a wife's boasting.
My men will be ready when you are, Dragonborn. You have a truce to arrange first, eh?
No doubt requesting to garrison his men in my castle. How many times must I deny him?
No one seems to know. Perhaps the return of the Dwemer. Perhaps the end of the world.
No, but I know that you're going to turn up missing if you keep up this kind of talk.
No! You're wrong. You must be wrong. Laelette may have met her fate out in the marsh.
Now me, I'm no weakling. In fact, I bet I've got the strongest arms in all of Skyrim.
Now, you can go back to your College and leave me be, or I can kill you. Your choice.
Of course there is Farengar. He might be the Jarl's wizard, but at least he's a Nord.
Of course you want to invest in my business. I'm the finest blacksmith in all Skyrim.
Of course, my dear. It may prove to be quite the curiosity! One must always be alert.
Of course, of course. But such things are valuable, and usually falling apart anyway.
Of course. Alduin wahlaan daanii. I would not have helped you if I thought otherwise.
Oh Jon, darling. You know you're the only stone-biting, knuckle-dragging Nord for me.
Oh, by the Divines is it that obvious? I swear, if my Gunnar was alive to see me now.
Oh, just one apple, Carlotta? Just one tiny apple. I'll pay you tomorrow, I swear it.
Once you have it, I want you to place it in Brand-Shei's pocket without him noticing.
One person's trash is another's treasure. Don't be surprised if you find that gone...
Patience, my son. The hunter days not welcome the blood of his prey, he waits for it.
Perfect. Melting this down will give me plenty of gold for those necklaces I started.
Perhaps the Stormcloaks might rally to take back Riften one day. Only time will tell.
Please, lower your weapons so we can speak. I have proof that you've all been misled!
Pruzah. As good a reason as any. There are many who feel as you do, although not all.
Quickly, if you please. I'm quite busy running errands for my bastard of a brother...
Sad, isn't it? We can't afford to keep the place running since these attacks started.
Sadly, I am resigned to just reading of its wonders through my research of the Skull.
She began to spend a lot of time with Alva. Yet just a week before, she despised her.
She's part of the Imperial delegation. You can't dictate who I bring to this council.
Shh.. Uncle, please. Keep your voice down. I'm fine. But we should go inside to talk.
Shor's beard! He's going after the Eyes of the Falmer? That was Gallus's pet project.
Skyforge Steel is my art and honor. The Companions need the best, so they come to me.
snort of derision. Wordless [QUOTE]bah![QUOTE] or [QUOTE]harrumph![QUOTE], basically.
So while I was in Ivarstead, I heard news that something terrible happened at Helgen.
So, Brynjolf doesn't even bother to show up himself anymore, eh? What's this message?
Sovngarde is a myth, you s'wit! And now you can join your ancestors in service to me!
Steel's good, but loyalty's better. I'm loyal to Dengeir first and the Empire second.
Still, you have a point. Camilla letting Faendal visit her isn't a good thing for me.
Susanna's the third. It's always the same: young girl, killed at night, body torn up.
Thank Kynareth for you, stranger. I'd almost given up hope of walking away from here.
Thank you for getting her back from the Forsworn. Dibella was smart to have sent you.
That armor... Are you one of the Emperor's protectors? Can't say I envy you that job.
That I am. My father left it to me after he died in that Great War against the Elves.
That means more time for my experiments and less time in the field. Much appreciated.
That was well done. Come on. I've been wanting a closer look at one of these buggers.
That... I gave it to her on our wedding day. Help me, Divines... it's true isn't it? 
That's the battle you need to fight. Not this. This will be suicide. And to what end?
That's the spirit! Larceny's in your blood... the telltale sign of a practiced thief.
That's what everyone keeps saying. But you didn't kill her. That's what I was asking.
The blubbering barbarian and the tenacious mother. Must have been one of them, right?
The museum is doing well. I haven't told anyone about the... incident with the Razor.
The Snow-Shod's are very trusting to let me run this place without their supervision.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.
The temple's been abandoned for decades now. Ironic isn't it... a ruin within a ruin?
The thing is, I never wanted to follow in his footsteps... I some ways I still don't.
Then turn around and go back where you came. City doesn't need you, doesn't want you.
There's a man named Braig inside these mines. Besides me, he's been here the longest.
There's no need for that. Not like he's a friend of mine or anything. Just calm down.
These days, we have more people like you coming in, looking for healing and the like.
These timber supports are rotted through. It's a wonder this place is still standing.
They did not have Dragonrend. Once we bring him down, I promise I will have his head.
They say Helgen got hit by a dragon. One of those horrors comes here, we'll be ready.
Think about it. Have they tried to stop the civil war, or done anything about Alduin?
This is the Gildergreen. It was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun.
This shrine is our thanks to her. That none will forget that she watches over us all.
Thorald's disappearance has been hard on all of us, but Avulstein has taken it badly.
Though I suspect he'll prefer to send his [QUOTE]Stormcloaks[QUOTE] to do it for him.
To return to its past glory, it must reacquaint itself with the hatred of this world.
Together, we made short work of them and the last one limped away licking its wounds.
Too much magic can be dangerous. M'aiq once had two spells and burned his sweetroll. 
Unless you intend to bury someone, this isn't the place you're looking for, traveler.
Untold numbers of Nords died defending the Empire against the Dominion. And for what?
Very well. Empty the vessels into the sconce near the throne, then sit in the throne.
Wait, hear my plea! My master, he is lost between worlds and I cannot bring him back!
We also keep a constant vigil against those who practice the vile arts of necromancy.
We couldn't have done this without you. The Empire glories in your accomplishments...
We had that beast contained. And you released it! Why? Why would you do such a thing?
We have to be very careful, Brynjolf. Mercer is a Nightingale, an Agent of Nocturnal.
We Nords have a long history as warrior poets. I am proud to count myself among them.
We will do our best to teach you how to use your gift in fulfillment of your destiny.
We'll meet you there. Be careful. That part of the Reach is rough country these days.
We'll protect Erikur as best we're able, but I fear the throne of Solitude is cursed.
We're not killing them, they were already dead. We're helping them back to Sovngarde.
Welcome to Eldergleam Sanctuary, my friend. If you have any questions, speak to Asta.
Well done! Your continued efforts have been of great benefit to the people of Riften.
Well that much is good. Let's finish this first war before starting the next one, eh?
Well, I'm not sure how they've managed it, but they have. No leaders since Ysgramor. 
Well, I'm quite sure I've never been interrupted like this before... the audacity!...
Well, sir, it's a farmhouse. It's not going to be as clean as your house in the city.
Well, well. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. I've always got time for lovely ladies.
Well, whatever you're doing, keep doing it and you'll have me as a customer for life.
Well. I, uh, can see you're not one to be trifled with. Let this be a warning to you!
Well... when you put it that way, I think I do know the old guy you're talking about.
What are you doing here? You need to get that Staff, or else we don't stand a chance!
When I found this, I immediately thought of you. Here. A small token of my gratitude.
When the orcs invaded the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters here to die.
When the ritual's complete, the Skull will be free and then Erandur will turn on you.
When you work hard enough, really get into a rhythm, everything else just fades away.
Why, hello! Here to buy? If you have to ask the price, you may be in the wrong store.
With a bit of luck, we'll catch them completely off guard and even the odds a little.
Without it, I cannot finish my work. All these years, so much time, so much energy...
Word is the College of Mages is back to normal. If there's such a thing for that lot.
Wouldn't surprise me. They've done nothing to help in the fight for Skyrim's freedom.
Yes, Master Elgrim will be pleased I've restored his stock of these rare ingredients.
Yes, yes, you're entirely brilliant. Conquering madness and all that. Blah blah blah.
Yes. I'll give Tullius one more chance to quit Skyrim with his tail between his legs.
Yet here you are with my weapon that you could have easily sold or kept for yourself.
You are relatively new here, are you not? I have noticed you, but we have not spoken.
You ask me, those brats in the orphanage are better off, now that old Grelod is dead.
You don't just waddle in here and get to speak to the boss. Who do you think you are?
You have a lot of nerve coming near me again. I'm still sore from what you did to me.
You have the ring. All you have to do is pick Brand-Shei's pocket and plant it there.
You just need to remember that there's a war on, and firewood isn't cheap these days.
You realize if you set foot in there, you're never coming back out. They'll kill you.
You say you found it in Hjerim? Friga's old place. Let's go have a look around there.
You seem to be a little short on coin. Come back and see me when you've got the gold.
You should see that Orc over in Understone Keep, have him forge you some new armor...
You withdraw from Falkreath, and allow Siddgeir to resume his rightful place as Jarl.
You wouldn't know it now, but the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns were once fast friends.
You'll be viewing the memory of another through your own eyes and with your own body.
You're such a wet blanket, captain. Can't a girl have a little fun from time to time?
You're wrong. It is my business. You may be the only one that can stop these dragons.
You've no hope of defeating me, pup. Don't bother. Why not broker a bargain, instead?
Your crimes offend the Code of Malacath and we demand payment. Choose. Gold or blood.
Your idea to start a brothel, right? Do you want me to tell you exactly what I think?
Your kind - joorre - mortals - created it as a weapon against the dov... the dragons.
...should have known she was lying... said she'd wait for me... but they never wait...
[QUOTE]May those above judge me, and those below take me, if I fail in my duty.[QUOTE]
A gate guard who let Ulfric Stormcloak escape the city, after he killed the High King.
After all, where is the value in creating art if there is nobody left alive to see it?
After that, the shortsword will feel like a knitting needle when you pick it up again.
Ah, good. I've been wondering how we were supposed to defend this place from a dragon.
Ah, good. Markarth is just ahead. I'm glad to make it through the Reach one more time.
Ah, yes. The courier. I guess you know my secret ingredient for that spiced beef, now.
Ah. Of course. Not everyone has an appreciation for the artistic wonders of the world.
Ah. Well. Hmm... krosis. There is one... detail about Skuldafn I neglected to mention.
Ain't nobody high and mighty in these halls, exceptin' the Jarl. And don't you forget!
All my gold... completely gone. Now I have to start over. I'll never use skooma again!
All right. I was going to suggest the Jarl hire someone to sort this mess out, anyway.
All this standing around is rubbish. We should be taking the fight to the Stormcloaks.
An old tomb, built by the ancient Nords, perhaps dating back to the Dragon War itself.
Ancano's power is growing. We can't crack whatever magic he's using to shield himself.
And despite the Imperials and their treaty, he will always be one of the Nine Divines.
And for their bloody sacrifices, the Dragons gifted their priests with terrible power.
And me and Mila used to climb up on the roof of Dragonsreach and look for birds' eggs.
And of course, they own Cidhna Mine, the finest prison and source of silver in Skyrim.
And yet, in the end, only two locations have been revealed to us. One is your College.
Anyway, after I got back to the Guild, I decided to start calling myself Twice-Killed.
Are you a member of the College, or did you just steal those robes from a real wizard?
Are you done? Did you just come here to make speeches? Or can we get down to business?
As my Thane, I'm sworn to your service. I'll guard you, and all you own, with my life.
Aventus really did it! He got the Dark Brotherhood to kill old Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Aye, that I do. I ain't sayin' he was perfect, but he knew what it meant to be a Nord.
Be careful out there... wouldn't want to lose such a promisin' cutpurse now, would we.
Because Calcelmo doesn't want anyone to go in. He runs the museum, he makes the rules.
Beyond that are two exterior gates. Find a way to open them and we can take this city!
Black Briar? How dare you shove that swill in my face. I'd rather drink mammoth drool!
Boss was looking for you - said he'd be up at the summit. Better not keep him waiting.
Brynjolf's been sending idiots like you down here for years looking for their hideout.
But I don't do that stuff anymore. Father keeps catching me and then I get in trouble.
But now Kematu's gone, and the rest of his snakes should slither back to their desert.
But stopping Alduin is one thing. Helping you wipe out dragons again is quite another.
But that isn't important right now. What is important is that you might be Dragonborn.
But when it's time to draw blood, there's no one in Skyrim I'd rather have at my back.
But... you're right. There's nothing to be gained by refusing the Greybeards' request.
Came here to start a lumber mill. Who knew the Nords cared about a bunch of old trees?
Damn those Forsworn. Think they can kill people in my city? I'll have Madanach's head!
Damnit. Where'd they get catapults? The city walls are already falling apart as it is.
Did you know my father? He was really important. He even talked to the Jarl sometimes.
Do these steel walls and strange Dwemer devices make you uneasy? Perhaps it's just me.
Do you know I look forward to Burning of King Olaf each year just because of the fire?
Don't be sorry for me. I just - if I would have known it would come to this. Mother...
Don't make me laugh, baby Battle-Born. You'll be afraid of me till the day I kill you.
Evgir Unslaad has come at last. The [QUOTE]Season Unending.[QUOTE] War... without end.
Excellent. With my brains and your brawn, that treasure will soon be mine... uh, ours.
Exploiting? What's that supposed to mean? Erik works the farm because he's a good lad!
Folks have gone missing the past few weeks. Word now's that our hunters are gone, too.
For all I know, he's already forgotten the conversation. I wouldn't get your hopes up.
For most people, long years of training are required to learn even the simplest Shout.
Fortunately, I persevered and the other groups were either killed or they left Skyrim.
Galmar. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear?
Good. All will be revealed in time. Keep playing your part, and Azura will reward you.
Good. I'll do the same. We've still got plenty of shafts from that Riverwood shipment.
Good. Too many Nords in this town have been listening to Ulfric's narrow-minded words.
Gularzob has been chosen as chief. He will one day be great, but he has much to learn.
Have you met my dear brother Erikur? The man's as trustworthy as a Khajiit goldmonger.
Have you met my father? He was the steward, up at Dragonsreach when Balgruuf was Jarl.
He becomes a full-fledged member of the Bards College. Please welcome our newest Bard!
He is our creator and master. The Daedric Lord of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse.
He is the Daedric Lord of the Orcs. The keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse.
He left to fight in the Great War and never came back. So he's not my problem anymore.
He's a powerful ally in Markarth. Should help the Guild regain a foothold in the west.
He's always used the ban on the worship of Talos to stir people up against the Empire.
Hearken now, sons of snow, to an age, long ago, and the tale, boldly told, of the one!
Hello, yes? I'm the Dean of History. And scribe work, when I can find some quiet time.
Here, let me teach you a thing or two about Alteration magic. It's the least I can do.
Here. Take a look at this. Some of the Jarl's men came by and left this bounty letter.
His name's Malborn. Wood elf, plenty of reason to hate the Thalmor. You can trust him.
Hmm? Oh, yes. Presumably something rather specific to dragons, or even Alduin himself.
Hmm. There's no simple answer to that. You want the long version or the short version?
Honestly, I'm not certain. I've yet to be allowed into the monastery. Perhaps one day.
Huzrah nu, kul do od, wah aan bok lingrah vod, Aahrk fin tey, boziik fun, do fin gein!
I also know that no one really believes that. I've been trying to avoid him, honestly.
I barely make enough for us to eat as it is, father. You can't just drink it all away.
I care little for idle conversation, but perhaps you need help with Conjuration magic?
I don't have time for anyone too lazy or cowardly to make their own way in this world.
I don't know exactly. We need to find the ancient burial mound. Let's ask around town.
I figured that I would run the mine someday. I just didn't figure that would mean now.
I give you three days before you screw up and someone runs a knife across your throat.
I had no idea you were a woman of violence. What exactly are you intending to do here?
I have a saying - I'm not going to feel what you have to like. Or something like that.
I have done no such thing, nor do I intend to. I simply wish to live my life in peace.
I hear talk about a regiment coming to clear the crypt out. We'll see if that happens.
I hope the wind dies down a bit before tonight. Hard when you've got to sleep outside.
I knew the Greybeards would send you for the horn if they thought you were Dragonborn.
I know of a ship coming in from Hammerfell. Some cargo might get [QUOTE]lost[QUOTE]...
I know what you want. Word travels fast around here. Discovered some big mystery, huh?
I need to get back to the customers. We'll talk more of this when I come home tonight.
I suppose. Just get something to eat and stay away from the Bee and Barb for a change.
I tell you this province is losing its grip. The bandits become more brazen every day.
I thought about becoming a bandit. I decided I preferred clean clothes and fresh mead.
I trust that this is just the begining of a long and mutually beneficial relationship.
I understand. Some journeys must be taken alone. I'll be here if you change your mind.
I was in charge now. I pushed them on, insisting it would be worse to try and go back.
I was wondering. Has Faralda been in recently? Borrowed any books that you can recall?
I wish I knew. The journal is written in some sort of language I've never seen before.
I wish you didn't hate him so much... I wish the whole family could be together again.
I would be fine if they didn't.  Have you seen their eyes? They don't have any! Gross.
I'll always be a commander, even if those Stormcloak dogs have stripped away my power.
I'll consider it. Many of the people I deal with are... secretive. You know how it is.
I'm always looking for able fighters. Not everyone can say they made it out of Helgen.
I'm just a soldier. Killing is my job! Surely you can't fault a man for doing his job?
I'm just here to provide protection for his eminence's cousin. Please, enjoy yourself.
I'm not afraid of the remnants of the Legion, in time they'll all give up and go home.
I'm not certain if I could even make it to the top without collapsing from exhaustion.
I'm on my way to Windhelm to join up with the Stormcloaks. Ulfric has the right of it.
I'm under a lot of pressure. If you don't leave me alone, I won't be held responsible.
I'm well aware that I won't like it. But it's my duty to keep my people safe. Tell me.
I've already agreed to pay him quite handsomely for the... well, the item in question.
I've come to warn you that the Thieves Guild seems to be back to its old tricks again.
I've heard of them. Something about the men who live in the hills and attack caravans.
I've known Bersi a long time. Even before he opened that rubbish heap he calls a shop.
I've seen documents dating back to the late Second Era. Beyond that, it's hard to say.
I've spent a long time building up a list of contacts for goods from all over Tamriel.
I've taken to hiring a few extra men of my own just to keep up with all the shipments.
If either these Nords or Imperials had some red in their blood this war would be over.
If I were you, I'd keep away from the barrow on the east side of town... it's haunted.
If money's all you hold dear, then you you end up like Jaree-Ra. A plague on the city.
If one of my enemies wouldn't pay to have me killed, I'd take it as a personal insult.
If she's the best Ulfric has to offer, we might've been better off with the Imperials.
If there was any justice in the world, I'd just get this over with and die peacefully.
If word gets around that I bedded her, they'll lose all respect for me at the meadery.
If you must know, I'm the maid. And the master of the house is old and needs his rest.
If you see my father Octieve around, stay clear. He'll only ask you for money or mead.
If you're looking for a room, try the Bee and Barb. This place is for the working man.
Imagine, blowing up an entire town. Damn College... Winterhold will never be the same.
Inside, you will find an elven mage who can turn the brightest star as black as night.
It is true, J'zargo suspected there might be problems. But this is most disappointing.
It seems our enemies have no end of spies, saboteurs and assassins to send against us.
It was a family heirloom. I can't even put a price on how much that thing means to me.
Jarl Igmund can't ignore us for much longer. Not if the Silver-Blood family has a say.
Just give me the letter. I presume once I have it, I can do as I please with it? Good.
Look, we don't have much love for your kind down here. Probably best if you just left.
Looks like we can take the low road or the high road across this chamber. Your choice.
Looks like you're still in one piece. And more importantly, so is the book. Thank you.
Lorkhan's eyes! Look at that big bastard! Keep your head down, let's see what it does.
M'aiq carries two weapons, to be safe. What if one breaks? That would be most unlucky.
Maven Black-Briar always remembers her friends. That's why I'm in charge of the place.
Molag Bal. You think you can best Boethiah's faithful? I have won this contest before!
Morrowind used to be a lovely place, but you couldn't pay me to live there these days.
My camp is nearby in the ruins of Nilheim. Get me there safely and you'll be rewarded.
My experiments can't be completed until you've brought me those ingredients. Do hurry.
My men know what to do. Make sure you do your part. I'm putting my city in your hands.
My prison. The source of half the silver in Skyrim. The most secure prison in Tamriel.
My purpose in using Snow Veil Sanctum to ambush Mercer wasn't simply for irony's sake.
Nazir told me what happened in Solitude. You poor dear. You've been through so much...
Never much cared for that Balgruuf myself. He was in the Empire's pocket, so to speak.
Nevertheless, my Order will not act directly. You must take it upon yourself to do so.
New here too, eh? I'd hoped I wouldn't be the only Nord, but I should've known better.
No doubt most folk in Skyrim consider the dragons terrifying. I find them... wondrous.
No, I really don't. It'll be a while before I'm ready for that. I'll be on my way now.
None of your damned business who I am! If you're going to kill me, just do it already!
Normally you'd need to show some aptitude with one of the schools of magic, but you...
Not a chance. Not for this. You're going to the Cidhna Mine for the rest of your days.
Not that it matters anymore. No one bothers coming to Winterhold for any other reason.
Not today. I'm just not ready to make the climb to High Hrothgar. The path isn't safe.
Now that we've got that out of the way, I'll take everything you have... or your life.
Of course! Any friend of Hadvar's is a friend of mine. I'm glad to help however I can.
Of course! It's where my mentor, Sinderion said he was going to do his field research.
Oh you poor thing, you must be starving. Come to the temple later and let us feed you.
Oh, Jora. Good to see you. I was wondering if you might ask Lortheim something for me.
Oh, that's right. I keep forgetting to pick that up. Poor Kerah, such a patient woman.
Oh. I... well, I honestly didn't expect you to come back. Of course, I'm glad you did!
On behalf of the Empire, and myself, please accept this gift along with your new rank.
One apple. Since the Blackbloods were dispatched I've had good luck getting shipments.
One moment while I [QUOTE]correct[QUOTE] some of these documents... That should do it.
One of these days we need to head back to the Rift. Get some of that good Riften mead.
Only Paarthurnax, the master of our order, can answer that question, if he so chooses.
Only reason I'm so good with a lute is because I'm old. It takes a lifetime to master.
Paarthurnax. The dragon, that the Greybeards have been protecting for all these years.
Perhaps the College of Winterhold. What learning there is in Skyrim is gathered there.
Perhaps you should start at the docks and work your way out towards Goldenglow Estate.
Place the crystal in the center of the armillary. Then we can worry about attuning it.
Please... don't dally. I've wasted enough time arguing with my useless assistant here.
Private Morrard... Angela's daughter was in that scouting party. She needs to be told.
Puttin' together another shipment from Morrowind, Vekel. Lookin' for anythin' special?
Really? I knew he was mixed up in something dangerous, but I hadn't heard he was dead.
References to similar stones appear in lore throughout the various Tamrielic cultures.
Riften must be returned to Imperial control. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.
Rumor holds that the Aretino boy brought an assassin here. Sounds like nonsense to me.
Same as ever. Trying to keep from freezing to death, trying to keep food on the table.
Shiny trinkets for your good lady! All crafted by the great Eorlund Gray-Mane himself!
So I'll sell whatever I can. If it's worth putting a price on, you can bet I'll do it.
So what do you have to say for yourself? How can I be sure you're not an Imperial spy?
Sometimes you just do what needs to be done. You don't have to hate a man to kill him.
Still, you are a good friend to J'zargo now, for taking this risk. J'zargo thanks you.
Stop! Are you so blind to our danger that you can't see past your petty disagreements?
Sure, but he'll ask for a whole lot. I mean, you are asking him to betray Mercer Frey.
Sure, how about I get Dirge to knock you over your head and dump you into the cistern?
Synda... you left your dagger behind again yesterday. I told you, the road isn't safe.
That it is. Good to be home. Let me know if you dig up any ore. We'll pay a fair wage.
That's interesting. Why do I care? You want a drink, or maybe just a few broken bones?
That's it. Something's inside the house. Come on, we're getting to the bottom of this.
That's the spirit. I'll get all the details from Galmar when he gets back. Now then...
The ceremony you so rudely interrupted was the Exalted Protocol of the Dibellan Sybil.
The memories. I cannot stand them. You must take them away, return them to Avanchnzel.
The nearest modern incarnation of it is the strange rituals practiced by the Forsworn.
The old man had one wish before he died. And he didn't get it. It's as simple as that.
The other Blades? No. Best not to think what the Thalmor do to their victims, my dear.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.
The war bleeds Skyrim. It bleeds her dry and I think none of us are the better for it.
There are few places where one can pursue my type of work without fear of persecution.
There are no expectations. This College is a place to study and practice magic freely.
There are some experiments the College frowns on. If they're aware of them, of course.
These Stormcloaks are nothing more than an armed mob. This war won't last much longer.
They burned his body before I could raise him... it should have been returned to me...
They didn't put up much of a fight. All that was left were the women and the children.
They outlawed the worship of Talos, Skyrim's most beloved son. There's thanks for you.
They run a private shipping operation, and would love to have the docks to themselves.
They're sayin' dragons have returned to Skyrim. Now that there, that's a real problem.
They've been around as long as I can remember, but only recently focused on our ships.
This city still reeks with the stench of the Stormcloaks. Makes me sick to my stomach.
This war of yours makes it difficult for a resourceful woman to advance her interests.
This won't be easy. But that's why I'm sending you. You got the grit to get this done?
Thonjolf is convinced I've got some connections at the College, so he goes easy on me.
Too bad. That's what we're playing, and you're the Elf. Now go hide so I can hunt you!
Try Hulda, the innkeeper at the Bannered Mare. It's just up the road, near the market.
Um... We're not talking about Barbas, are we? Clavicus Vile's... dog? Oohh... awkward.
Umm... you're not planning on using that weapon, are you? At least not on me... right?
Until brave heroes step forward to destroy these monsters, that is the best we can do.
Vignar. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear?
Walk into the the wrong place with your weapon drawn? You might not walk out again....
We are the true sons and daughters of Skyrim, and Ulfric... he's the truest of us all.
We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lad. We're right behind you.
We own Cidhna Mine. Best prison in Skyrim, and source of half the wealth in this city.
We're nothing to the Daedra. Pawns to move around, praise, and punish as they see fit.
We've made a mistake. Now move along before that mouth of yours gets you into trouble.
Well, come back when you have some more evidence. I think you're on the trail, though.
Well, J'zargo is surprised. And pleased! There is real competition here. This is good.
Well, now that you mention it, there is something I've been trying to get my hands on.
What do you think you're doing, walking around dressed like a damn Stormcloak traitor?
What? The Augur? Oh no, I'm quite sure that's... He's nothing I'm involved in. No, no.
When he became Jarl, I insisted on serving as his protector. He had no cause to argue.
When the colossus struck, Grimsever was knocked from my grasp and I was wounded badly.
When the orcs raided the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters behind to die.
When the top level was built, no more could be placed. It was and is the maximal apex.
When the troubles began, he took the Empire's side. We haven't spoken much since then.
When Ulfric was killed, justice was done. That might sound harsh, but it's how I feel.
where welcome, well-earned, awaits those I judge fit to join that fellowship of honor.
While the idea seems dubious at best, it has not, at present, been entirely ruled out.
Why don't you swallow that stubborn pride of yours and ask Eorlund Gray-Mane for help?
Why is everyone so upset? If there's Forsworn, the Jarl will take care of them, right?
Yes, we spoke at length while you were in Whiterun dealing with our meadery situation.
Yes. If you were ready, of course. Are you familiar with how marriage works in Skyrim?
You acted very nobly in helping my master realize his life's work. Thank you for that.
You are a welcome guest, but you must still respect the rules of the Jarl's household.
You don't need my fruit, I've heard when you sing people throw tomatoes at you anyway.
You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in your defense?
You have gone beyond my teachings, which is quite a feat. I did not think it possible.
You look like a traveler. Someone that has seen far away places and heard new stories.
You seem to have a knack for this kind of thing. I'll make sure people in charge know.
You should be pleased, Elisif. You've done well for yourself as the Empire's pet Jarl.
You speak truly, Dragonborn. Sometimes the grubby business of politics clouds my eyes.
You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
You think you're tough, huh? Wandering Skyrim is a picnic compared to tunnel crawling!
You were in Saarthal, yes? It has come to my attention that something was found there.
You're all heart, Kodrir. I bet Lady Mara is weeping a special tear for you right now.
You're in my home. That's right. This here place, Breezehome, it belongs to old Terek.
You've arrived at last. The hero who prevented me from being bound returns to my fold.
...I saw a dwarf! I did! I did! Cicero saw a dwarf! There... Oh. No, sorry. No dwarf...
[QUOTE]Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor, Titus Mede II...[QUOTE]
A Nord nobleman I served was stabbed in the night. Wasn't me, but I knew I'd be blamed.
After all, it is she who brings rain to our crops and fair weather on the harvest days.
After the place is yours, come back to me and we'll deal with the rest of the nonsense.
Ah, and word has come in from Markarth that the keep's cook has met an untimely demise.
Ah, so the Brotherhood has come for old Hern, has it? Well then, let us meet as equals.
Ah, the air is good today. I welcome the smell of blood from all the kills I will make.
Aha! I knew you could do it! I just knew it! I knew the Dark Brotherhood would save me!
Ahrk fin norok paal graan fod nust hon zindro zaan, Dovahkiin, fah hin kogaan mu draal!
Alduin isn't getting any weaker while we stand around here gawping at the architecture.
Alduin will hide in this lightless mist until we Shout together, and shatter his power.
Alduin, his hunger insatiable, hunts the lost souls snared within this shadowed valley.
And here I expected you to hop the next caravan to Morrowind. What have you got for me?
And I see them all. The ones in Sovngarde. The ones trapped with me in Hircine's realm.
And now there's talk of rebellion, and dragons? What help could Idgrod be against them?
And on that day, we will confiscate his city, and restore the rule of law to his lands.
And thus, you're not skilled enough to be a candidate. I'm afraid we're not interested.
Arch-Mage Aren is already hard at work, and hopefully we'll have more information soon.
Be cautious. Beasts are not nearly as predictable as men. Give the thing a quick death.
Best not to ask too many questions about it. People might get the wrong idea about you.
Both of the buildings are connected by tunnels made by the pests infesting the meadery.
Brother Umurn is a strong warrior. I look forward to fighting him for chiefdom one day.
But a day, shall arise, when the dark dragon's lies, will be silenced forever and then!
By the Hist, if I don't get something soon, I don't know how I'll get through the week.
Can I give you a little tip? Take every job you can get or else you'll end up a beggar.
Citizen. I'm warning you. Your presence is interfering with Imperial business. Be gone!
Clamoring in angry voices, calling out for justice, for war, they sat me on the throne.
Come on inside. Sigrid will get you something to eat and you can tell us what happened.
Come to see the hag with an offering of coin, then? So be it. I accept your investment.
Come to sell me something special, or did you just want to look through my merchandise?
Do I look like a guide? Only thing I do is sell meat. Now, are you going to buy or not?
Do not ask me to take treasures from this place. I will not risk the anger of the dead.
Dreh ni nahkip. Discipline against the lesser aids in qahnaar... denial of the greater.
Ease your heart, our honor is unstained - it's by Shor's command we curb our onslaught.
Elenwen! This servant girl has been throwing herself at me in a most disgusting manner.
Feel free to look around. We have a fine selection of herbs here at Angela's Aromatics.
For the first time in a long while, I truly believe that there are brighter days ahead.
Freshly killed. Whoever did this is still close... and will suffer for their insolence.
Gallus, Mercer Frey and I were once members of what's known as the Nightingale Trinity.
Giving up Markarth is a heavy price for this truce, Dragonborn. I hope it was worth it.
Grelod... murdered. Here. I... I need... air... You... you... Get out of here! Get out!
Gwilin! I told you to cut those boards at twice arm length! My arm's length. Not yours.
Ha! We'll see about that. This is a special brew, very strong stuff. Let's get started.
He promised Peryite would be present at all times and give us comfort in our suffering.
He revels in the chase, and also gave the [QUOTE]gift[QUOTE] of lycanthropy to mortals.
Here you sit arguing about... nothing! While the fate of the land hangs in the balance!
Here. I had to use simple words, but this letter should convince Camilla it's from him.
Hert keeps giving me this look. I don't know if she wants me or if she wants to eat me.
Hjaalmarch will be turned over to Ulfric, with Sorli the Builder assuming the Jarlship.
How did you manage to damage it, then? This is what I get for not retrieving it myself.
I believe once it's interred with my father's remains I'll be at peace with his memory.
I couldn't ask you to undertake such a trecherous journey, it would be a fool's errand.
I didn't say I wouldn't fight the giant. I just said you're going to help me get to it.
I don't see why we should live as an underclass to the Nords. If anything, they owe us.
I even named my shop after it, hoping that it might attract anyone who had heard of it.
I handle the fishin', numbers and bedlam jobs... the ones with the more personal touch.
I have shown the people that when our Jarls drink the Empire's milk, it makes us weak. 
I have taught the Way of the Voice for centuries and the Thu'um since long before that.
I heard a scream and came running, but she was already... like this... when I got here.
I hope so. The Legion is Skyrim's only hope right now. Come on, we'd better get moving.
I keep telling you, without a warming enchantment, it will never grow past your ankles.
I know more than most. I trained with the Greybeards at High Hrothgar when I was a boy.
I know, and I appreciate it dearly. But I can't help but feel we could be doing more...
I never meant for any of what happened here. Tried to seal it up, lock it away forever.
I remember when you were the same way. The more they train, the more they'll cool down.
I remember you. You're the stranger. Father says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
I sell my catch across a good portion of Skyrim... it's worth its weight in gold to me.
I served in the Legion with Thongvor Silver-Blood. He's a good man and a tough soldier.
I suspect we might have use for someone resourceful like you. Not many survived Helgen.
I think Aldis understands. I don't think I could have stayed here if anyone else had...
I trained in Hammerfell during my journeyman years. Redguard smiths are second to none.
I understand. Hopefully I'll be able to save my meager earnings up to buy them one day.
I want to make money just as much as you do, but we don't want to make the Nords angry.
I was about to say how impressed I was that you always managed to put it back together.
I would not have expected a scholar of such an esoteric turn of mind among their ranks.
I'm glad to know that, because I need your help. You see, I've lost something precious.
I'm just out and about, love. The Bannered Mare can do without me for a bit, I suspect.
I'm just saying that these ceramic lamps make me nervous. They just seem so... fragile.
I'm saying you've got the coin but you didn't earn a septim of it honestly. I can tell.
I'm sorry I lost myself for a moment there. I just need some time to get over the loss.
I'm still pretty sore and can't really walk too far without having to rest for a while.
I've already provided you with the key to my museum, what else could you possibly want?
I've been pushing the Salmon but I'll tell you the Slaughterfish is a bit better today.
I've enjoyed the boons that come with beastblood. Just like every member of the Circle.
If it were up to you, the Dragonborn would sit dreaming on this mountain doing nothing!
If she can't tell what's real and what's not, how will she continue to lead Hjaalmarch?
If you don't watch out, you might even earn Vex's respect. Now that'd be something, eh?
If you had to kill your own brother to be allowed back home, you'd think twice as well.
If you've got some time, stop by my House of Curiosities. I promise you'll see wonders!
Incredible! Uh... sir, you have no idea how long I have waited for such an opportunity!
Is it really me, or is it your wife? You need to make a choice Bolli. The honey or her.
It is especially potent against the undead, and should burn them to a crisp in no time.
It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't even make sense.
It's a problem with the Forsworn. Unpredictable, unknowable, and dangerous. Be careful.
It's a simple job, Drennen. We get in, we steal the Lexicon, we leave. Don't get jumpy.
It's been a long time since anyone joined us. Seems like people are in a rush to leave.
It's called a shortsword, oaf. It's quicker. Sharper. Like a razorfish against a whale.
It's made of gold with an inscription on the inside that says [QUOTE]sand elske.[QUOTE]
It's probably for the best anyway; I'm far better at fishing than working in a meadery.
It's the most secure prison in Skyrim. Throw scum in, close the gates. No one gets out.
It's the same dream over and over again. You think that's normal? It's evil I tell you!
It's too bad the orphanage ain't letting us kids get adopted. I'd be the best son ever.
Just because I don't fit in here is no reason for others to ridicule me behind my back.
Keep at it. We need to work twice as hard now that fat-headed Leigelf has declared war!
Knowledge is power. Knowing spells can be powerful, but applying that knowledge is key.
Kodlak killed, Jorrvaskr attacked. How could this happen, within the walls of Whiterun?
Krosis. No. I know little of what has passed below in the long years I have lived here.
Kynesgrove is this way. We can travel together or split up and meet there, your choice.
Let those soldiers come here! You've never seen me throw incense. I could fell a giant.
Let's see... you have the symbol for [QUOTE]King[QUOTE]... and [QUOTE]Warrior[QUOTE]...
Live in my tower, roost in my home. Mix pretty poisons and collect shiny eyeballs, yes.
Look at the size of this place. Have you ever seen anything like it in your life, lass?
Look more closely at it. My glories shall protect you from all this world's grievances.
Look, I've moved all over Skyrim selling these bits of junk and I'm barely scraping by.
Many thanks. And please, take this gift. I hope it's a fitting token to honor the deed.
Maybe that claw has a clue on it? You know, how to set the rings so the door will open.
Maybe you can help me. You know, by way of making amends for getting me into this mess.
Men and women join the war, they travel far on these roads to spill each other's blood.
My clan's shield. So Lenne really did stumble into that cave and was eaten by monsters.
My father was rarely home, so it was my mother who actually taught me how to use a bow.
My job is to quell this rebellion, and I intend to do just that, dragons or no dragons.
My knowledge of this temple comes from personal experience. I was a priest of Vaermina.
My time at the Bards College was brief. A prodigy has little need for formal education.
Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're carrying, eh lad?
No doubt she's convinced you that she's the victim. But, do you know why we pursue her?
Nords have always supported the Empire, and the Empire has always been good for Skyrim.
Not now. If I don't pull night duty, I'll drink a round with you at the Sleeping Giant.
Now get going before Sabjorn grows a brain and hires someone else to do the dirty work.
Now I may look like a man, but I still feel the animal inside of me, as strong as ever.
Now our purpose is clear. I'm all that's left of the Blades, and you're the Dragonborn.
Oh, Grimvar... always with the nonsense. No, no, of course not. Those are just tales...
Oh, I don't think you're old enough for that yet. You can help me salt the cheese curd.
Oh, it's no trouble. She's a smart little girl. Might talk your ear off, but she's fun.
Oh, sure, he'll be back in a century or two, but think of the fun I can have 'til then.
Oh, very good. Very good indeed. You, my dear, are going to fit in here quite nicely...
Oh, yes. Weylin. Bastard could have at least gone crazy after we made our silver quota.
Oh. Well, thanks for trying I suppose. I'll just have to come up with the coin somehow.
One day when you and I are on the Circle, we can change how things are run around here.
One of the guards from Dragonsreach came to me, worried about a prisoner who's escaped.
Pa says I'm too young to fight in the war, but I can still help by patrolling the town.
Papa says I'm not old enough yet, so I help out by patrolling the town with Lucky here.
Passing through on your way to High Hrothgar? About to make a delivery up there myself.
Ro fus... maybe you only balance the forces that work to quicken the end of this world.
Rogue wizards. I've never trusted magic types. The College is bad enough. Destroy them.
Serving as Steward to Ulfric Stormcloak was a great honor, but I don't miss his temper.
Simple-looking objects that could channel the powers of the werewolf in new directions.
Simple. Do as you're told and keep your blade clean. We can't turn a profit by killing.
Stand next to me, and prepare your Whirlwind Sprint. Master Borri will give the signal.
Taken alone, the draugr aren't so fearsome. They're far more deadly in greater numbers.
That crown should be around here somewhere. Just keep an eye out for the bonewalkers...
That is the truth, my friend! Maven is a saint and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
That remains to be seen. By rights, she has a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim.
That's cheating. We're playing hide and seek. You have to find me before Laelette does.
The blade can be as lethal as the spell, but deadlier still is the one who wields both!
The Divines saved me from the streets, and they can save you from your trials, as well.
The gods gave you two hands, and you use them both for your weapon. I can respect that.
The information wasn't easy to come by, but everyone has a price. And a pain threshold.
The only thing that matters to me is keeping my wife safe. I won't let anyone harm her.
The rumors were true... I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.
The Thalmor invite me here to remind everyone that they can tell the Empire what to do.
The Torpor should be in a tall bottle with dark liquid. If you find it, bring it to me.
The Unholy Matron, the Shrouded Lady, the Mistress of the Void. She goes by many names.
The way our crops have been growing, Rorikstead must have the richest soil in the hold.
There are others who study, to be sure, but they do so in private, and often in secret.
There has to be more to it than that, though. I wish I knew where the bees got it from.
There's no shame in such thoughts. A man without doubts is a man without a conscience. 
They say Ulfric Stormcloak murdered the High King... with his voice! Shouted him apart!
They're the meanest, toughest sons of bitches Skyrim has to offer. And they want this. 
They've barricades to block us, but we'll tear through them and the rebels behind them!
This is a jail, owned by the Silver-Blood family. We use the prisoners to mine for ore.
This is your last warning, outsider. We keep the peace, here. Stay out of our business.
Those who worship at the shrines will sometimes receive boons from the gods themselves.
Tiid krent. Time was... shattered here because of what the ancient Nords did to Alduin.
To think that we would sit down with that... Thalmor bitch. I say she walks or we walk.
Unbelievable! You have done us a great service here. I can't begin to thank you enough.
Until then, I alone have the right to have wives and children. It ensures our strength.
Vampires are utter abominations. We need to do everything in our power to destroy them.
We are not welcome here in Whiterun, so we will be in Rorikstead if you learn anything.
We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lass. We're right behind you.
We could use a pair of hands and a strong back. There'd be a little coin in it for you.
We don't just let people rot in cells until they've served their time. Here, you fight.
We've got the same pride, the same honor, and we've got wealth. No wonder they envy us.
Welcome to the Moorside. If you need anythin', I'll be 'round. Good to have a customer.
Well that's an excellent question. You haven't overlooked that little detail, have you?
Well, King... If you don't mind, we'll just take that crown of yours and be on our way.
Well, what the hell is Mercer going to do about this mess? Have you even talked to him?
Well, yes. I was completely unaware of the reputation of the other party in this trade.
What a... fine idea, my Jarl. However, I would suggest we wait until the war has ended.
What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?
What's more, Elisif has declared the Burning of King Olaf should become a weekly event.
What's the point? I'm not very good, and it's only for the same few people every night.
Whatever you do, stay away from that Black Door. Being near it chills you to the bones.
When the Red Mountain burned, you could scarcely breathe in Morrowind. So we came west.
When the wounded soldiers began to return from battle, I did what I could to help them.
When you get back to Riften, tell Delvin this new arrangement's working out quite well.
Who are the Stormcloaks, and why would mama want to spend time with them instead of me?
Who sent you? Was it the College? The Jarl? We agreed there would be no more questions.
Whoa, there. I don't know where you're going, but stay out of that mine. It isn't safe.
Yeah. Someone ticked off Maven and she wants to teach them a lesson... our way. You in?
Yes, just this morning. It was from Logrolf. He wrote to thank us for the food we sent.
Yes, my Jarl. We could hardly waste anyone else's precious time on such a tedious task.
Yes, that's right. Whether or not I'm interested depends on what you've got, of course.
You are kind to offer. We believe the bandits are a part of a group headquartered here.
You dropped it by mistake? Well, if I was you, I'd go grab it now before somebody does.
You have earned my favor for now, mortal, and so I give you a little gift. Use it well.
You have my gratitude. That spider had been interfering with my excavations for months.
You know I don't mean that. We need to find a way out of this. Perhaps talk to Laila...
You speak to a Vigilant of Stendarr. Cavort with any Daedra, and we will hunt you down.
You want to get back into our graces, you need to talk to Vex. She'll set you straight.
You're a strong warrior, Skjor. Your heart is fiery and that serves you well in battle.
You're always talking about the Forsworn. You aren't thinking of joining them, are you?
You're always thirsty. Just like you're always drunk. Now let me get back to my rounds.
You're our favorite kind of traveler, then. The market area is just inside in the gate.
You're welcome to look around, of course, but understand that this place belongs to me.
You've produced a rarefied solution there, an infusion of pure essences. Artfully done.
Your actions here were a disgrace. You betrayed your oath to the Emperor at every turn.
...I'll never do another span in that stinking jail... rather die than give myself up...
...order of his eminence... ...possessor of these papers... the [QUOTE]Gourmet[QUOTE]...
Actually, that's when she politely asked me to hand over my coin purse. Can you imagine?
Ah, yes. The pirate captain. A ruthless she-devil, by all accounts. Deadly with a blade.
All right. If I make it back to Windhelm, I'll make sure Ulfric knows how you helped me.
And don't you think of coming back to Rorikstead until you get her back from that Giant.
And it is for these reasons that I cannot accept the mantle of [QUOTE]High King.[QUOTE] 
And take out resources like sawmills, flour-mills, and smelters, with a little sabotage.
And then I would wake up. And hope that it was just a dream... but know that it was not.
And why shouldn't I? Just because I'm a Gray-Mane doesn't mean I can't earn my own keep.
Apparently Larina told him some story about the flute being able to make the dead dance.
Arnbjorn is safe, and for that you have my thanks. But what of the fool? Is Cicero dead?
As many know, there is an ongoing effort to research the work of the Archmagus Shalidor.
As you wish. Speak to me again if you decide to purchase some decorations for your home.
At long last. An ancient evil is avenged. The shades of many Blades salute you this day.
Aye, I suspected as much but I've never been able to catch that little sneak with proof.
Beg pardon. You dropped some armor over there. Don't suppose you'd mind if I... took it?
Being a Jarl isn't something I ever wanted, but if I can help these people, then I will.
Blood from a stone, Klimmek. I've been out there every morning. They just aren't biting.
Bryling owns this mine. I wouldn't have much to live for if she hadn't offered me a job.
But at the same time, all of it is true. Even the falsehoods. Especially the falsehoods.
But for you, the dragon speech is in your blood, and you learn it almost without effort.
But I've seen what you can do. And heard of the love that Kodlak had for you. The trust.
But mom, it's so boring with just me and Torom. I was just asking Skaggi some questions.
But never mind all that. We've got a job to do, and nothing's going to stand in our way.
By Talos, that's an excellent question. I hope you haven't forgotten that little detail?
By Talos, the stones on this one! You're in no position to dictate terms to us, Tullius!
Can you lead the way to where Shor's hall waits, beckoning us on to welcome long sought?
Can you not put aside your hatred for even one moment in the face of this mortal danger?
Can't tell you. It's a bit of a trade secret I picked up when I was living in High Rock.
Certainly. Destruction spells come in different forms, each useful for various purposes.
Damn right it has. Demand's never been so high, at least not since I built the new mill.
Details, details. The Sanguine Rose breaks all the time and is fixed with but a thought.
Did you know Brynjolf was looking for you? I think it's about the Guild Master ceremony.
Do you get to the Cloud District very often? Oh, what am I saying - of course you don't.
Don't fool yourself. It's only a matter of time before you people are run out of Riften.
Don't presume upon our friendship. My first loyalty is to the Thalmor, as you well know.
Don't threaten me, boy. You're either a Nord who respects our traditions, or you're not.
Don't wait around for me. I bet I'll beat you to Korvanjund even though you start first.
Don't worry, brother. I'm sure he's fine. We've waited longer before receiving a letter.
Drem. All in good time. First, a question for you. Why do you want to learn this Thu'um?
Education is never appreciated until after the fact. Young people never understand this.
Eh, let her get upset. She'll be angry no matter what I say, might as well enjoy myself.
Even when you get to the last sip in your flagon, it'll taste just as good as the first!
Everyone thinks I'm too young to be a ship's captain, but I'm going to prove them wrong.
Falk told me what you did for us at Wolfskull cave. He says you're someone we can trust.
Falkreath was once full of wanderers and warriors like yourself. Those were better days.
Fate drives you, but you follow your own path. Choose wisely, lest you wander into evil.
Find the three vessels within Valthume, then return to me. With these we can defeat him.
First, Master Wulfgar will teach you the final word of Unrelenting Force. You are ready.
From all our research, it seems they were intent on discerning the nature of the divine.
Giants have been spotted up near Red Road Pass. Best to keep away and avoid it entirely.
Give him this gold. Tell him you need Arkay's help exploring an old cavern for treasure.
Go away! I don't know who you are, but this is my spot! Whatever's on that ship is mine!
Good. Being at the summoning created a connection to Potema, you are the one to do this.
Good. I lost more than a few acquaintances to the Falmer and I wish to see them avenged.
Got some nice comfy beds at the Braidwood Inn, if you're looking to flop down somewhere.
Got something for just about everybody in here. Give a holler if you have any questions.
Guards are useless. They just stand around waiting for a full regiment to come and help.
Had he not, Ulfric would have had cause to call a new moot and a new vote for High King.
Have the spirits told you where I may find a wife? One who will be safe from this curse?
He committed atrocities so infamous they are still remembered, thousands of years later.
He owes me a steep debt. In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work for Mercer.
He's a fool. A dragon has attacked Helgen. Dawnstar needs the Empire now more than ever.
Her Benevolence has taught me patience and mercy, but these vampires deserve none of it.
Here. This is from a recipe my people have passed on to me. I can cook another tomorrow.
Hmm. Well, if that's what the Greybeards told you, I confess I don't have a better plan.
Hmph. Well, that's sure to throw a branch into Falkreath's well-oiled political machine.
I assure you, had she been displeased with you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
I believe I was put here to protect this place from the darkness that pervades Solitude.
I cannot stay. Not here, not in Whiterun. It likely won't be safe for Avulstein, either.
I do have one set of bracelets in a style that is popular with the nobility in Sentinel.
I don't like to brag, but I once took down a bear at three hundred yards. In a blizzard.
I finally understand what it all means. What it was all for. The killing. And the dying.
I fought in the Great War. I cut enough young lives short, I'm not going to do it again.
I have tasted the voices of Alduin's allies on the wind. Pogaan nahlaas, vokrii wah jun.
I hope that someday this city will be free from corruption and we can all live in peace.
I import books  whenever I can. Most Nord works are too bawdy and violent for my tastes.
I just hope I can do right by the good folk who are looking to us to see to their needs.
I like your fire, though. You'll make a fierce Companion. Let us hunt together sometime.
I look forward to the day when this rebellion is put down, and we once again have peace.
I may have accidentally let a prisoner escape. The leader of one of those bandit groups.
I must end her terrible influence over these people before the damage becomes permanent.
I must have misheard you. I thought you asked me to help you trap a dragon in my palace.
I saw this and thought of you. It would be a waste on anyone lesser. I hope you like it.
I say, you didn't hear any loud noises last night, did you? No, ahh... explosion sounds?
I see. It probably doesn't even matter now, what with the mess that's been made in here.
I served in the Legion. Perhaps I'll show you some of their technique one of these days.
I shouldn't have taken them, I know! It was stupid. I was stupid. It won't happen again.
I suspect Brurid planned this, there's been bad blood between us since the king's death.
I think a donation of 500 gold on your part is necessary in order to put this behind us.
I told Arniel what I wanted in exchange for it, and he was unwilling to come up with it.
I wanted you to have this. A token of my affection. Don't mean we're engaged or nothin'.
I work with my mother, to sell fruits and vegetables. It's fun most days, but hard work.
I'd much rather it be in the hands of an ambitious and talented person such as yourself.
I'll be out in the market all day, from eight in the morning until eight in the evening.
I'll tell you who I don't envy - those poor children who lost their parents in this war.
I'm a pirate, sweetie. Assassination attempts are an occupational hazard. Now, shall we?
I'm not a man, I'm a weapon in human form. Just unsheathe me, and point me at the enemy.
I'm not sure yet. I have a few ideas, but I'll need some time to pull things together...
I'm originally from Cyrodiil, but I left there after I had a falling out with my family.
I'm starting to think we might not even find iron in here. We've been at it for so long.
I'm worried about my son. I'm keeping an eye on him for a little while before I pass on.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around the Pale.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around the Rift.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Whiterun.
I've heard Jaree-Ra is hanging around the Wells District, looking for new blood to hire.
If Alduin himself could not stand against your Thu'um, I feel no shame in my own defeat.
If I had been smarter, I would have kept my boat. Coming to this city was a big mistake.
If I'd been on guard at the Thalmor Embassy, wouldn't nobody be disturbing that party...
If not, it isn't me you'll have to answer to, but the people of this city and this hold.
If Vokun is as powerful as I think, I may need a little help um ... dealing ...with him.
If you do this, if you kill the Emperor... Oh, how the masses will fear and respect you.
If you two are finished with the touching homecoming, there's a city in chaos out there.
Ironically, I pointed him in the same direction I pointed you. To Markarth and Calcelmo.
It does not matter to M'aiq how strong or smart one is. It only matters what one can do.
It may not be [QUOTE]official[QUOTE], but there is a, uhh, project I've been working on.
It must be secured. Ancano's actions prove that the world is not ready for such a thing.
It seems that law-breakers in the Pale have no desire to stay there. I don't blame them.
It sounds like Eastmarch is too busy with their war to keep their own prisoners in line.
It was difficult at first. The Nords of this city are, at best, suspicious of outsiders.
It was the Forsworn from Broken Tower. Never been much trouble before. What's it to you?
It's all in the way you hold the axe. Caress it, like any wench, and she'll do ya right.
It's good to see a fresh face. You wouldn't have happen to come from Whiterun would you?
It's got to be tough. Skyrim's a hard enough land when you've got a roof over your head.
It's held many names: Dagger of the Final Wounds, Bane of the Righteous, the Kingslayer.
It's like relaxing into a warm mug of spiced mead. I'm losing aches I didn't know I had.
It's okay, now. You've found a friend who understands you. You can let go of your guilt.
It's right there in the name of the most powerful family in Markarth. The Silver-Bloods.
It's the whole reason Ulfric revolted against the Empire. Well, the first reason anyway.
It's worth quite a bit actually. Quite a catch! Here you go, this should make you smile.
Just open the cage, and I'll leave quietly. Won't make a sound, won't bother you at all.
Just try it. Maybe a little time inside Cidhna Mine will get rid of all that fat on you.
Lady Ateia has already arranged for me to perform in the court of the Jarl of Falkreath.
Lest our honor be lessened should we allow these bloodthirsty beasts to prowl our lands!
Look at that. I've told you to watch your tongue and mine is waggling. I've said enough.
Malacath has given me a vision of a glorious death. I am to wait here until it finds me.
Malkoran has forced the doors shut. But this is my temple, and it responds to my decree.
Maybe that claw has a clue on it? You know, how to turn the rings so the door will open.
Maybe we should start selling the soil along with the dung. We could make a tidy profit.
Maybe you're right. Even so, I can't help wondering if some other force it at work here.
Meals are served to Bards at designated times. Find an inn if you want to make requests.
Melaran, you lazy milk drinker, have you finished studying the imports from Black Marsh?
Mighty Thu'um, like a blade, cut through enemies all, as the Dragonborn issued his roar!
Mind yourself in my city, lass. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight...
Most people would need to train for years before they could even attempt a single Shout.
My master has abandoned me! Abandoned his people. And nothing I say can change his mind.
My men have their orders. But it's a big city, and there's a war on. Plus these murders.
My mother passed away when I was just a babe, so he did his best to raise me on his own.
My role as advisor to the Arch-Mage is aided by knowing everything that transpires here.
My thanks for bringing this to my attention, citizen. Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
Need a weapon? Hmmm... By the looks of ya, yeah... Think I've got somethin' you can use.
Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're carrying, eh lass?
No problem. Thanks for springing me. I owe you. Look me up in Riften if you make it out.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about returning to the ancestral home of my people.
Not a peep. Those prissy Bretons can't be made to lift a finger to help their neighbors.
Now something's happening to bring them back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.
Now we have to pin all these recent murders on you. Silence witnesses. Work. Work. Work.
Odfel, I've told you time and time again. I'm not interested in a relationship with you.
Of course, on further reflection, that may have simply been an attempt to scare me. Hmm.
Off to Solitude with you. Time to give the Emperor some real motivation to visit Skyrim.
Oh thank you, kind stranger. Thank you for helping Cicero and his poor, stranded mother.
Oh, no. I'm no fool. You'll learn what you need to know once we've come to an agreement.
Oh? Were you after her yourself? I won't stand in your way, my friend. You have my word.
Old Nord sacrifice place. Be careful around here. Let's look for a way to open the bars.
Our objective is the drawbridge. If we can find a way to drop it, the city will be ours!
Plus, the meadery's doing so well, I'm almost having trouble keeping up with the demand.
Quickly! Kill him now. Kill him and claim the Skull for your own! Vaermina commands you!
Remember, we're not looking for trouble. We need to get to Kynesgrove as fast as we can.
Right, which we had already established. And you managed to hide the body as well? Good.
Seek out this rogue shifter. Tear the skin from his body, and make it an offering to me.
She and Hod run the mill. I make a decent living sharpening axes and fixing the sawmill.
Since we're all here at your request, I'd like to hear what you think Markarth is worth.
So I pay for the weapon shipments and you oversee their distribution to the Stormcloaks?
So, job's done and you even brought the gold. Best of all you did it clean. I like that.
Sweet Breath of Arkay, were these the cannibals that were plaguing the Hall of the Dead?
Take this and hold onto it. I'll be back for it later. I'll pay you good. Don't lose it.
Thank you. Here, I was going to bring this to my sister, but I think you should have it.
That 'incident' in Morthal was just a misunderstanding. No matter what the guards claim.
That attitude would get you far, if you were some stuffy merchant or a Jarl's footstool.
That door has the best puzzle locks money can buy. There's no way it can be picked open.
That mound you remembered sounds like what we're looking for. East of Kynesgrove, right?
That's a good concoction. But keep trying new things. Alchemy rewards inquisitive minds.
That's what you said last week, and the week before that. Now go, before I call a guard.
The Arch-Mage triumphant! The College... Skyrim... All of Tamriel owes you a great debt!
The College of Winterhold is the only place in Skyrim open-minded enough to teach magic.
The Dwemer, they were uhh, masters of magic in a way we can't even begin to conceive of.
The Empire may have been good for Skyrim once upon a time, but those days are long past.
The entrance to a dwarven city. All manner of strange traps and machines will be inside.
The Imperials now control Riften and have placed Maven Black-Briar on the Jarl's throne.
The Jarl has put out a bounty on Forsworn. Here, take a look at this decree for details.
The Jarl trusts few, and they will be his undoing. The dark child knows of what I speak.
The job pays well, so I hope I can make arrangements soon. We could really use the gold.
The old man's got a good sense for people. He can look in your eyes and tell your worth.
The only reason you could disagree is because you are losing so badly you cannot see it.
The original Phial was made from this snow. We'll only need a small bit for the repairs.
The Pale will throw those Imperial backbiters up against the wall when they come for us.
The real work happens in places like this. Blood and sweat is what makes the world turn.
The Stormcloaks will withdraw from the Rift, allowing Imperial troops unhindered access.
The ways of the mystic are known to me. I have remedies and cures, should you need them.
Then we need the tusk of a mammoth, ground to a fine powder as only the giants know how.
Then you didn't know Roggvir, and you have no idea what it means to be a Nord of Skyrim!
There is no adversary more deadly than a vampire. They are as cruel as they are cunning.
There's a fine line between respect and boot-licking, new blood. But I like your spirit.
They were golden, even when they were dead. But their blood was red. I knew it would be.
This is insane! I didn't steal anything! I never saw this ring before in my entire life!
This is Karthwasten. Mining town. I hear they've had a lot of trouble with the Forsworn.
To battle, my friends! The fields will echo with the clamor of war, our wills undaunted.
Vex is ready to tear you apart. I hope you have a good excuse for bringing Karliah here.
We had the advantage of surprise this time, but don't expect it to last. Let's move out.
We live by his code and follow his teachings. An outlander like you wouldn't understand.
We were betrayed by one of our own kind. In fact, I'm to blame for what's happened here.
We were supposed to be rich by now, you know. Thorgar insisted we'd be swimming in gold.
We're liberating Morthal. Join the brothers gathering for the attack. Talos be with you.
We're the ruling body of the Aldmeri Dominion. Saviors of Mer. Victors of the Great War.
We're used to getting by on scraps, but the Shatter-Shields want everything for nothing.
We've scoured the town and I've spoken to every contact we have left. No sign of Mercer.
Welcome! Allow me to recommend the Black-Briar Mead... the purest brew in all of Skyrim!
Well you don't even need to ask. No, I don't have anything for you. Not anymore, anyway.
Well, I don't know. Not yet... it flew over the town and landed on the old dragon mound!
Well, I'd better get some sleep. Don't mind me, though. You two make yourselves at home.
Well, whoever this mysterious marking represents, they'll regret starting a war with me.
What does he want now? I already explained to him that you can't get blood from a stone.
What's done is done. Here, I want you to have this. Bringing me closure was kind of you.
What's there to tell? It's mostly gone now, thanks to those damned mages in the College.
When Elgrim said we were setting up shop down here, I told him he would catch his death.
Which means you need to look the part, and not be armed to the teeth. Here, put this on.
Who I am really isn't as important as what I am. And what I am is an admirer. Of sorts. 
Will he swear fealty to me, that all may know we are at peace, and a new day has dawned?
Winterhold would allow us to directly threaten the rebel supply lines out of Windhelm...
With both Alduin and Paarthurnax dead, a dark chapter in history will finally be closed.
Wo lost fron wah ney dov, ahrk fin reyliik do jul, voth aan suleyk wah ronit faal krein!
Yeah, but you're into gold. Let me know if you change your mind. I'm not going anywhere.
You are eager to begin your adventure. Excellent. The sooner begun, the sooner done, eh?
You are hereby dishonorably dismissed and removed from the rolls of the Imperial Legion.
You consider Restoration a valid school of magic, worthy of study, don't you? Don't you?
You go speak with Muiri. I've got to deal with the Night Mother and her little... clown.
You have it. The Kel - the Elder Scroll. Tiid kreh... qalos. Time shudders at its touch.
You keep saying that. What if she's gone forever? What if they've done something to her?
You know, I'm not sure. My husband's been tending to the vines, so I'll have to ask him.
You know, if you've got the aptitude, you should join the Mages College in Winterhold...
You need to bloody well get your priorities straight if you want to make it around here.
You should know. You got the map for me. The dragonstone you got for Farengar, remember?
You stay out of trouble, now. The Castle Dour dungeon can break even the strongest will.
You wouldn't know it, but before my family got killed? I was the luckiest man in Skyrim.
You'd better remember her right fast, before I call the guards and have you hauled away.
You'd do well to get out of here before I change my mind and have you locked in irons...
You'll only have what Malborn smuggled in for you, plus whatever you can pick up inside.
You're right. Let Tullius be the one to insult the Greybeards by refusing their summons.
You've got no idea. Half the men in Whiterun have proposed to me. Some were even single.
Your deed was true, and so is my gratitude. Please take this in return for your efforts.
Your family? You've poisoned the Reach with your tainted silver for long enough, Thonar!
A few years back, I commissioned a unique quill from a good friend of mine in Winterhold.
Again? He can't simply cancel an appointment with the Jarl! He serves in my capital city!
Ah yes, excellent samples. Thank you. This coin should compensate you for all the bother.
Ahrk fin Kel lost prodah, do ved viing ko fin krah, tol fod zeymah win kein meyz fundein!
Ain't no doubt about it. The Thieves Guild is back, and they've got Riften in their grip.
All my auguring never predicted this. A woman for Mauhulakh, eh? We'll see how this goes.
An [QUOTE]interesting[QUOTE] mixture... Keep experimenting. You'll improve with practice.
And by the Eight, aren't you fortunate that my steward has just the place for you to buy.
And in due time, the Moot will meet, and settle the claim to High King once and for all. 
And it looks undamaged. They'll be pleased, I'm sure. And we're pleased with their money.
And there are accounts of your suspicious behavior throughout the city. Now come quietly.
And these men and women - they call themselves Stormcloaks because they believe in you...
As in death there is new life, in Oblivion there is a beginning for that which has ended.
Astonishing. To think you actually were able to reach it and yet return to tell the tale.
At least Ulfric's men are willing to fight for their principles, barbaric as they may be.
At this rate, he'll give the entire Riften Fishery away to charity. Then how will I live?
At this time, I would like to make a few statements regarding policy here at the College.
Attention, everyone! Could I have your attention, please! I have an announcement to make!
Bah! This is a waste of time. I can see that we won't get better terms from this council.
Been a while since I've seen one of those. What you've got there is a Stone of Barenziah.
Beirand said you got here just before the execution. Must have been a lovely first sight.
Bone chimes... clever. Rigged to wake the draugr I'd bet. Don't blunder into any of them.
Breathe deep, mortal. I would have you hear me well, so let these vapors fill your lungs.
But the day words are enough, will be the day when soldiers like us are no longer needed.
But then the dragons returned. And I remembered that the Blades used to be dragonslayers.
But you're right. This should scatter the rest of them. I can go back to my life for now.
By the Eight, keep your voice down! Do you want the entire village to learn our secrets? 
Calixto, someone left an interesting ring in here a few weeks ago. Would you like a look?
Certainly not. But a true warrior would have relished the opportunity to take on a giant.
Colette has already told you. You must be tested before knowledge can be imparted to you.
Concentrate. The battlefield is full of distractions. Ignore them! Focus on your targets.
Degaine the beggar got himself kicked out the Temple of Dibella. Caused quite the ruckus.
Did you hear? The Riverwood Trader was robbed! Poor Lucan must be torn to pieces over it.
Did you see a hound on the road? A fine, strong creature that's been wandering near town.
Do me a favor. If you speak to Maven, tell her everything's well at hand down here, okay?
Don't you Nords put any stock in your own traditions? I thought the Moot chose the king. 
Dorian is helping me perfect my fencing, but I don't think I'll ever be as good as he is.
Even the Imperials might eventually decide to patrol their perimeter. Get yourself ready!
Feel free to take a seat, or pray at the shrines. We appreciate worship in all its forms.
Figures -- I doubt you have sufficient knowledge to harm the Phial even if you wanted to.
For that amount, I can. Fine. I did notice something odd last time we handed out the pay.
Got any sausages? I'm cooking a special breakfast for a friend, and they're his favorite.
Ha ha! Are you kidding me? I've got the entire Thieves Guild at my back. What've you got?
Have you ever seen the Orrery in the Imperial City? It was the inspiration for this idea.
Have you met Balimund? I'm his apprentice. He's teaching me all about being a blacksmith.
Have you met Grisvar the Unlucky? He's rightly named, and he's also a thief and a snitch.
Have you seen Refnir? I told him to check out the well drain, but he never reported back.
He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Be careful. You're not the only one looking for him.
Help me down, and I'll show you. You won't believe the power the Nords have hidden there.
Here, take him this letter. I may not be as eloquent as he is, but I hope he understands.
Here, take this Grand Soul Gem, fill it for me, and bring it right back. I'll be waiting.
Hey. What's the matter with you? You have no right to spread rumors around town about me.
His name is Torsten Cruel-Sea. He's really rich, 'cause he owns a farm called Hollyfrost.
Hmm, yes. But your su'um is strong. I do not doubt that you can convince him of the need.
Hmm? Ah, yes, the Jarl's protege! Back from Bleak Falls Barrow? You didn't die, it seems.
However, don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.
I am on official business of the Grand Council of the Synod. That's all you need to know.
I am. I came into Arkay's light after the Great War. So many died by my hands, my magics.
I call upon Oblivion realms. The home of those who are not our ancestors. Answer my plea!
I can see the battle-lust in your eyes. Doom will surely come to any who cross your path.
I can't stand those braggart Battle-Borns. They think they're the gods' gift to Whiterun.
I dare say the Guild owes its survival as much to my family as it does to its own people.
I do. So few people possess the taste and sophistication of a proper wardrobe these days.
I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You treated us fairly despite your known rebel sympathies.
I don't care if you wrote it yourself -- if you want a book from here, you go through me.
I don't have them anymore. She took them... The Caller. She's the one who put me in here!
I don't know what to say. I didn't think anyone in Riften even cared what happened to me.
I don't suppose there's a point in keeping the secret if I'm going to die in here anyway.
I don't want to believe it. Wuunferth has been a trusted friend to Ulfric for many years.
I got someone who deserves a beating, but I need someone else to do it for me. I can pay.
I guess some things never change. Thanks for bringing this to me. Here, for your trouble.
I have overcome my nature only through meditation and long study of the Way of the Voice.
I have payments to make you realize. If I can't make them, I can't make Black-Briar Mead.
I have two others that wish to transact the Oath; to serve you both in life and in death.
I heard a rumor that these bandits were ransoming captives, so I thought she may be here.
I heard they live their entire life without uttering a single word; can you even imagine?
I just need you to go out there, look tough, and scare this milk drinker into submission.
I know, but I don't want to let them down. I guess I better start thinking about it soon.
I see. Well, perhaps you'll take pity on a humble priest who has lost something precious.
I still need some time to get used to the idea that there might be hope for us after all.
I still need you to make a batch of those fried potatoes. We can serve them with the ale.
I told you to weed the garden by sunset, and you didn't do it. Now you're in big trouble!
I trust I won't have to, but I'll bust your head in if you cause problems for my patrons.
I was Dengier's personal guard for years. I risked my hide more than once to protect him.
I was fortunate enough to be guided by one of Silvenar's master armorers until he passed.
I would think a man of your military training would be able to do with less but so be it.
I, Lurbuk the Great, will win the hearts of the people of Morthal one day, mark my words!
I'll be damned. Someone who actually escaped Cidhna Mine. You're the talk of the Warrens.
I'm a lot happier out here on the deck than I am wandering around in that ruin of a city.
I'm afraid he can. His authority comes from the emperor. Who you also serve, technically.
I'm glad there are guards outside the farm. I don't think I could defend the place alone.
I'm not one for commendations, but I might've lost everything that matters. So... thanks.
I'm on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Azura, the Goddess of Twilight. If you'll excuse me.
I'm the only person alive that can cultivate nirnroot from a seed to a fully grown plant.
I've been following him for months now. Well, not actually following. Trying to find him.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Eastmarch.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Falkreath.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Haafingar.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around the Reach.
I've done what I needed to do keep mother happy. It doesn't matter what I really believe.
I've half a mind to dismantle one of these Dwemer machines. I'd like to see how it works.
If I had any customers, I'd be worried about him annoying them. But, well... Look around.
If I was Maven, I'd blame the Guild for weakening and not being able to handle the place.
Igmund's father was killed by Forsworn. I won't rest until they've paid with their blood.
Imperial promises are simply a way to lull you while they prepare a dagger for your back.
In a mine, the poor man labors to find precious stones that only the rich man can afford.
In fact, I just got a special job request in. I haven't gotten anythin' like it in years.
In order to have the title bestowed upon you, you need to purchase a house within Riften.
In this business we rarely deal in names; our identity comes from how much coin we carry.
Is your armor made of... dragon bones? By the gods, what I wouldn't do for a set of that.
It became clear they're trying to hoard powerful artifacts, looking to consolidate power.
It does indeed. You know, I hear you had something to do with Sybille Stentor's demise...
It's not safe around here. There's thieves out there looking to steal everything you own.
Just don't expect us to at your back when Maven has your head on the executioner's block.
Just go right into the tower, then straight ahead to the kitchen. Gianna's expecting you.
Just keep on his tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.
Just remember, we take care of our own. Once you're in the Legion, you're in it for life.
Just... leave me alone! I've brought your mead, now drink it and shut your filthy mouths.
Klimmek brings food supplies up to them once every few weeks when the weather permits it.
Kodlak White-Mane is in a better place now. For is there any place better than Sovngarde?
Let that be a lesson to you young pups. There is no challenge that magic cannot overcome.
Light armor for scouting detail, heavy armor for full on combat, or something in between?
Lillith - always a pleasure. Just browsing, or were you looking for something particular?
Master Einarth will now teach you [QUOTE]Ro,[QUOTE] the second Word in Unrelenting Force.
Meet me at the Solitude stables after you've arranged things with Malborn. Any questions?
Might even build a new temple and put Heimskr in charge of it. Hah! I bet he'd like that.
Mirabelle Ervine... Or Tolfdir. They're qualified to discuss him. Not me, definitely not.
Most of the city's residents live in the Wind District, which is the middle of the three.
Most of the folk in the city believe as Ulfric did, that outsiders should not be trusted.
My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I'm afraid to go in by myself.
My husband, Gunnar, died about five years ago. Forsworn attack. I miss that stubborn oaf.
Name's Angi and if you try anything stupid I won't hesitate to put in arrow in your head.
Next thing you know there will be some kind of damn blight and undead will walk the land.
No, no. That's the beauty of the whole plan. We're going to get Sabjorn to give it to us.
Not all of us, just the members of the Circle. We shouldn't be talking about this anyway.
Not every Companion, though. Only members of the Circle all share the blood of the beast.
Not that there's anything that can be done about it. He's in good with the Thieves Guild.
Nothing would bring me more pride than to return the Key, but I'm afraid it's impossible.
Now I remember - you're that new member of the Companions. So you, what - fetch the mead?
Now you've put it all to rest, but it can't undo my mistakes. They can never be undone...
Now, I have a soul in Oblivion to claim. Take care of the house while I'm gone. Ha ha ha!
Now, I have work to do. Leave me to it, if you ever want to see the rest of your payment.
Oh that is exciting! I'm sure the court and the Jarl will love it. I'm writing it in now.
Oh, but I suppose you expect some compensation. Um... here, these potions should suffice.
On the top of the Throat of the World is a patch of Unmelting Snow. No heat can touch it.
One thing at a time soldier. Focus on our primary mission. We're searching for the crown.
Only a fool lets himself get surrounded. Back up and make them come at you one at a time.
Orcish armor, hmm? Had me a set of that once. Ugly and strong, like those that forged it.
Place the crystal in the central apparatus, and we can start the process for focusing it.
Please, there's no need for that here. Message understood. Here, I even have the payment!
Please. If we have to negotiate the terms of the negotiation, we will never get anywhere.
Please... How long must I do this? I keep praying, Night Mother. Why won't you answer me?
Praise Talos and all the Divines! Whiterun has been liberated by the true sons of Skyrim!
Proventus, you're my steward. Your job is to offer me counsel. This? This is not counsel.
Remember that old rusty sword I had? Damn thing must have had over a hundred chips in it.
Say, that's not a bad idea. You look like you could handle yourself against these beasts.
She's as stubborn as she is beautiful, isn't she? Glad you found a way to get her to pay.
Shor's beard, boy! You forget where you're standing? What kind o' business we're running?
Silus comes from one of the oldest families in Dawnstar. They have a complicated history.
So you were paying attention. I arranged to have Farengar recover the dragonstone for me.
So you're the one who's been down there killing all my wolves. You're gonna die for that!
So, you're the one Brynjolf's been jabberin' about. Been waitin' to have a word with you.
Some day soon I'll stop being afraid. Jouane is teaching me magic. He says I'm real good.
Soon, the elves will again seek to rule the world. We must ready ourselves to fight them.
Speak to Vex to make the proper reparations if you want back in. Now get out of my sight.
Speaking of sounding good, I've heard a couple of your classmates on the street recently.
Steady. A few dusty bonewalkers aren't going to stop us anymore than the Imperials could.
Talen, do you believe what they're saying? Do you really think the dragons have returned?
Tell you what. You keep making us coin and I'll worry about everything else. Fair enough?
Terrible. Only a matter of time before soldiers come and burn all my hard work into dust!
The beastblood has given me prowess, but my soul is now forfeit to Hircine upon my death.
The clans Shatter-Shield and Cruel-Sea see most of the gold that passes through the city.
The damned nightmares have finally stopped. Don't suppose you'd know anything about that?
The door up ahead will be locked. Klotha, one of the hagravens, will have the key on her.
The Dunmer came up with the stuff a long time ago. Very illegal and very hard to come by.
The exact nature of my research is a secret, I'm afraid, but it really is quite valuable.
The Flagon used to be packed every night with the boys from the Guild but now look at it.
The Forsworn are strange men. They fight to reclaim Markarth, but they live like savages.
The guards in Dragonsreach say you've aided the Jarl. On behalf of Whiterun, I thank you.
The Isle of Artaeum disappeared over a hundred years ago, and no one has seen them since.
The Jarls never want to pay to keep the forts. They just keep slipping further into ruin.
The land is beautiful, but I can't stand this cold. I don't know how Rustleif manages it.
The prevailing opinion of Skyrim natives is that the stones are indeed magical in nature.
The restless dead. Not pretty, but if you don't stop them, they'll move on to the locals.
The Silver-Blood family own half the Reach, and they won't stop until they own all of it.
The Stormcloaks are named after Ulfric. He's a bad man, but don't tell the soldiers that.
The Stormcloaks will withdraw from the Reach, allowing Jarl Igmund to return to Markarth.
The Thalmor sought the same thing, and it shall lead to his end as it has so many others.
Then we should soon be selling arrows by the bushel. A sword is no good against a dragon.
Then, maybe a few years ago, it all stopped. He didn't even bother to contact us anymore.
There's an old maid's tale that says our ancestors dug these mines with their bare hands.
There's every chance I'll return to find a pile of smoking ash where Whiterun once stood.
There's some trouble in The Pale. We need you to go in and clear out an enemy stronghold.
These are dark days. But at least we know we're doing our part to make things better, eh?
These old ruins... My father always told me to stay away from them. Good advice, I'd say.
They call me Dirge, 'cause I'm the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground.
This is getting ridiculous. If we can't get this open soon, the boss will have our heads.
This is neither the time nor place for such things. I'm surprised you would ask it of me.
This looks like the area Agna told me about. She said that the bear would show the way...
This looks promising. Akaviri stonework, I think. Reminds me a bit of Cloud Ruler Temple.
This message is for me. I understand now. I have work to do. You, I shall need your help.
To the Inn for a drink, of course! Where else could I even go in this gods-forsaken town?
Too many drinking games, too many bets, and I'm too old to ever raise the coin on my own.
Traitors, civil wars, dragons. Bah. Those troubles don't cross my doorway. So sit, relax.
Unlocking this mystery... The story alone is worth more riches than you can even imagine.
Warrior, good! I knew you shouldn't have been on that cart the minute I laid eyes on you.
We had the advantage of surprise this time, but things won't be so easy from here on out.
We haven't been expecting you, and the old man needs his rest. Come back some other time.
We spoke the traditional words of greeting to a Dragonborn who has accepted our guidance.
We'd better keep moving. I feel like that dragon might be up there watching us right now.
We'll call you Ice-Veins now, for the thick blood of our land has seeped into your heart.
Welcome I do not offer, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand.
Welcome, Dragonborn! Our door has stood empty since Alduin first set his soul-snare here.
Well let's not put it like that. Wouldn't want the Thieves Guild catching wind of us, eh?
Well, before that cave-in sealed our ships in here we could loot any size ship we wanted.
Well, even if you are trying to ruin my work, there's still something to be learned here.
What did you say? I ought to break off one of those tusks and use it as my drinking horn!
What happened to my Skyrim? Everywhere you look, cats, lizards and elves. It's sickening.
What you don't hear about are the ones who break off from escorts on the way to Markarth.
What? No. All right. I won't worry about the coin anymore, just stop giving me that look.
What's this? Some kind of code? [QUOTE]Need as much iron ore as you can dig up....[QUOTE]
Which means you don't remember losing your temper and throwing trash all over the temple.
Why that jealous idiot. Thought he could just manipulate me into never seeing Sven again?
Word is Ulfric Stormcloak escaped from the Imperials. War's only going to get worse, now.
Work needs doing, and if you're not up to it, maybe you're not cut out to be a Companion.
Wouldn't ever have expected to wind up living in a place like this, but the money's good.
Yes, milady. I've also taken the liberty in preparing a private carriage... just in case.
Yes, that's probably for the best. I really shouldn't risk getting on Elenwen's bad side.
Yes. For matters of such gravity, we need to know where you stand. Or who you stand with.
You and Madanach are animals, and I'll see you both rot to death in Cidhna Mine for this.
You can eat an ingredient to learn one of its properties. However, they taste disgusting.
You can't get inside though. They've kept that place locked up tight since the war began.
You certainly have a strange energy about you. I look forward to following your progress.
You have a kind heart; much too kind for Riften. Don't worry about me, I'll be just fine.
You must understand, the Psijic Order does not typically... intervene directly in events.
You smell like a pig's pen, too. What a stink! Have you been rolling in the dirt all day?
You survived Helgen? General Tullius told me what happened. Not many made it out alive...
You were seen coming in. The girl at the door is a Forsworn agent masquerading as a maid.
You've arrived at last. The heroine who prevented me from being bound returns to my fold.
You've shown those monsters that they will no longer be tolerated in the Pale. Good work.
Your father's too easy on you, boy. I'd have you cutting wood at dawn if you were my son.
Your words give voice to what we all feel, Ulfric. And that's why you will be High King. 
[QUOTE]He sacked Winterhold in dragon form, and bent their minds to blame Solitude.[QUOTE]
Ah, Bolli finally got someone out here. Well it's about time. I've been waiting for weeks.
Ahhh.... gotcha! Oh, Listener, you should see the look on your face! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ancano. He's in there, doing... something. We don't know what. We're trying to get in now.
And all heard the music of Alduin's doom. The sweet song of Skyrim, sky-shattering Thu'um.
And I found a new deposit of amber. Would have been nice to have some help pulling it out.
And it isn't just the dark elves they hate -- they make a target of the Argonians as well.
And let me guess, that someone is my so-called husband Leigelf? Well the feeling's mutual.
And you helped me! You helped poor Cicero! You talked to Loreius, got him to fix my wheel!
As long as she continues to keep me at her side, she can count on my blade to protect her.
As long as they're playing instruments they're passable. You don't want to hear them sing.
As Riften's Steward I'm afraid I can provide only limited assistance, but speak your mind.
Authorities? Have you been listening to what I said? They're all dirty. Every one of them.
Begging your pardon, milord. Your wife has run up quite an account in the last few months.
But my purpose was ultimately gained. My previous champion was erased, and a new one born.
But not Dragonrend. The knowledge of that Shout was lost in the time before history began.
But these Forsworn. They're nothing like the men I cobbled together. They're real killers.
But, I suppose, if it does actually turn out to be worth something, let me know, will you?
By Ysmir, this is just what we need. There'll be panic in the streets if this proves true.
Can't say I ever much liked the idea of the Empire telling us what to do an' how to do it.
Can't wait until we raise anchor. Anytime the boat's not moving, I start to get impatient.
Come see me in the marketplace tomorrow. You won't find better prices in all of Eastmarch.
Considering how the Great War ended, I think we need to be cautious about what we rely on.
Could I maybe, skip the excavation, Uncle Calcelmo? I, uh, I just think you won't need me.
Crossing the Guild was a bad idea. I'll buy goods from you after you settle your accounts.
Do you think they will sit idle while a dragon is slaughtering my men and burning my city?
Don't get too many folks up here these days. Sometimes I think they've forgotten about me.
Don't know her. Guards dragged that Forsworn's body away, though. Last we'll hear of that.
Don't let the vampires strike you or else you may get infected with their blood poisoning.
Don't underestimate my son, Skuli. He may look young, but he can handle any drunks we get.
Down with Ulfric the killer of kings. On the day of your death we'll drink and we'll sing.
Elsweyr is an arid land of deserts and rocky canyons, where the sun shines warmly, always.
Everything's for sale, my friend. Everything. If I had a sister, I'd sell her in a second.
Faralda. Don't act like she didn't say anything. I know her, I know what she's been up to.
Fine, but I'll still be missing my Gleda. Doubt I'll ever have a prize winning goat again.
For a few septims, I'll give you a brief tour that includes some of my most unusual items.
Give him the Rueful Axe and once we're reunited the Masque of Clavicus Vile will be yours.
Go to Malacath's shrine, southeast of Largashbur. See if perhaps he will aid us after all.
Good enough. We'll meet up near the watchtower. Don't take any chances until we get there.
Good to hear. You can be a difficult man to find. Thankfully those couriers are tenacious.
Good. Maybe we can lay up for a while. I hate to put your family in danger, Gerdur, but...
Good. They'll think twice before crossing us while their command structure is in disarray.
Got a good one here. Personal score to settle between myself and this mark. You up for it?
Grelod the Kind was, by all rights, a Dark Brotherhood contract. A kill... that you stole.
Ha ha! Behold the final trick of the Fool of Hearts! You think me near death? Think again!
He only cares about this stupid town, but Bassianus makes me happier than anyone ever has.
He's not compelled to, but dragons are prideful by nature and loath to refuse a challenge.
Hello, Jora. I'm glad to see you. In fact, I was just thinking about you and your husband.
Her name's Olda. If you've met her, then you probably already know what I'm talking about.
Here, take this. Assuming they even honor it, you should be able to get your prisoner out.
Here's the gold I promised. Keep following the trail and there will be more in it for you.
Hey there! Check out what my friend and I found. I'll sell some of it to you, if you want!
Hey, I may have had a few, but I can still count. You don't have a hundred septims on you.
Hey, remember that girl, Eisa? The one who sliced open that pickpocket they threw in here?
Hmm. How to explain in your tongue? The dov have words for such things that joorre do not.
Hmph. Fine. Go on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach knows more than you think.
Horses are my whole life. Back in Hammerfell, I helped my family raise horses at our farm.
I also handle the less important and day-to-day policies that effect daily life in Riften.
I am an advisor to the Arch-Mage. The Thalmor wish to promote relations with your College.
I can make all your problems with the guards go away. But it'll cost you. What do you say?
I can't afford to appear weak. I can't agree to this unless Tullius himself will be there.
I didn't go to all this trouble on a whim. I needed to make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap.
I do hope the court likes the verse. I think we've done an excellent job of recreating it.
I do hope you still have the Staff of Magnus someplace. I suspect you're going to need it.
I don't dare go back in now. I'll just have to hope that in the confusion he can slip out.
I don't know about the end of the world, but this dragon situation has gotten out of hand.
I fight for their wives and children, who's names I heard whispered in their last breaths.
I heard Brynjolf is looking for you. I think it's time for the Guild to have a new leader.
I know, my lady. I just needed to see you outside of court, away from all of the politics.
I never expected... well, suddenly here you are and now I'm too muddled to explain myself.
I offer remedies for ailments both common and rare. Do let me know if I can be of service.
I own the lumber mill, and pay a fair wage. See my husband Hod if you're looking for work.
I picked up a trick from a butcher in Elinhir, a small town over the border in Hammerfell.
I suppose it would be inappropriate of me to ask how you obtained this, so I simply won't.
I think perhaps it might be best if you lead the way. My eyes aren't what they used to be.
I understand. Speaking to a goddess is overwhelming for many. Return when you're prepared.
I wish we could offer more help, but our last attack went sour and we're all that is left.
I wonder if everyone else would be so happy to rifle through the bones of their ancestors.
I wouldn't have sent you in the first place if it wasn't going to be worth it. Now then...
I'll present this to the Jarl later. As for you, let me show you some smithing techniques.
I'll rest easy when we've driven every last Imperial pig back across the Jerall Mountains!
I'm becoming sick to death of your ideas. Not one of them has paid off since you moved in.
I'm Bothela's assistant. She's the one you should talk to if you need an herb or a potion.
I'm joking, of course, but I'm a lot happier seeing the Empire running things in Windhelm.
I'm just trying to imagine you hiding inside the body of a mammoth. Bloody brilliant idea.
I'm not certain what business it is of yours, but I'm moth... I mean Jarl Maven's steward.
I'm not sure what you're playing at, but you'd do well to remember your place around here.
I'm not sure. At first they accused me of being a Stormcloak, a secret Talos worshipper...
I'm sorry, but I can't do it. We'll just have to keep fighting the dragons as best we can.
I'm sorry, mother. I can't help it. All that stuff you like to do, it's just so... boring.
I'm sure you've made note of who's been the most helpful during your time here, Arch-Mage.
I'm the older sister, by nearly five minutes. Sissel's barely worthy to walk in my shadow.
I've already said too much. If anyone overhears what we're saying, it could start a panic.
I've been trying to figure out what makes Riften mead better than the stuff from Whiterun.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Hjaalmarch.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Winterhold.
I've got a bad feeling about this... something's just felt wrong down there lately. Eerie.
I've lived through rebellion, Forsworn, undead, witches, wizards, hagravens, and marriage.
I've tried everything I can to protect Riften's citizens from her family, but to no avail.
If I ever catch my husband in bed with another woman, he's going to find himself homeless.
If it's horses you want, I'm not sure I can help you. I have too much on my mind as it is.
If only Maven would stop raising the price on it maybe I could afford to stock more cases.
If you have the guts to head into the Ratway and get my bow back, I'll pay you what I can.
If you still need my blade, I'll join you. I want to make sure you get your money's worth.
If you want to enter Riften, use the North Gate. Otherwise, we have nothing to talk about.
If you wish to stand alone, so be it. If you wish for our help, you'll answer my question.
In the end, vampirism would endanger my ward Agni which would defeat the intended purpose.
Interesting problem. Hmm. Yes. I've been poring over the records here in Sky Haven Temple.
Is your armor made of... dragon scales? By the gods, what I wouldn't do for a set of that.
It brought me all the way to these frozen reaches from the warm embrace of Summerset Isle.
It does not surprise me. They do not share in what I see, and I cannot explain it to them.
It means living such that your Shield-Siblings would proudly say they fought at your side.
It seems that a predator has invaded their home, and someone needs to clear the beast out.
It's a necessary part of my job to mix with the upper classes of Skyrim, such as they are.
It's just one of those things that happens. The lungs just... give up. Even elves get old.
It's only a matter of time before their pointy ears start itching to rule the world again.
It's true that Whiterun is dangerously exposed as long as the Stormcloaks hold Markarth...
Jarl Laila Law-Giver will step down, and Maven Black-Briar will become the Jarl of Riften.
Just outside of Riften, beyond the Southeast Gate is a small path cut up the mountainside.
Largashbur will not soon forget what you have done. We have a second chance thanks to you.
Listen to you, speaking of sacrifice. You've never gone hungry a day in your life, Erikur!
Listen, Braith... Why don't you talk to your mother about this, okay? There's a good girl.
Living outside the walls is a risk, aye. But at least the guards don't come nosin' around.
Long ago, the Empire used the city to garrison troops who guarded the passes to Morrowind.
Marise, I've come to warn you that the Thieves Guild has been harassing shopkeepers again.
Mathies is a kind and wise man. The Nords could use more like him. So could the Imperials.
Me and Hathrasil mostly. Mulush barks at us all day, but I wouldn't call that honest work.
Mind yourself in my city, friend. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight...
Most of the time, people just forget I'm even here. That's why I hear so much good gossip.
My Amulet of Arkay. It's the source of my divine powers and also a sacred badge of office.
My father, Mralki, manages the inn. He used to be a soldier, but he left that life behind.
My hatred for the Empire is exceeded only by my hatred for their witch-elf puppet-masters.
My Jarl, we need to discuss the state of Markarth's collapsing trade with the other holds.
My mother spares no expense where I'm concerned. I'm heir to the family fortune after all.
My targets make the mistake of not perceiving me as a threat. Last mistake they ever make.
My weapons will someday be as strong as my mother's, and Malacath will be pleased with me.
No, no! Don't do that. No need to do that. I'm going. See? I'm leaving. No guards, please.
Not until introductions are complete. Zin. Heyv. Test your Thu'um against mine, Dovahkiin!
Now Sapphire wants her money back, and if I don't pay her, I think she's going to kill me.
Now that's how it's done! I doubt anyone in Skyrim could have weaved a better enchantment.
Now that's just sad. Come back when you actually have something to show for your thieving.
Now... if you're done bellyaching like a child, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?
Oh, but how can I defend you? How can I exert your will? If you will not speak? To anyone!
Oh, right. That whole thing with the elves. Well, it all worked out in the end, didn't it?
Oh, you can save your sinister bravado. I'll not go to my grave whimpering like an infant.
Old Delvin kept calling it a curse and we all laughed at him. Looks like the joke's on us.
On the other hand, you've weeded out the weak from among those who would deign worship me.
One day when you can see past your own interests, you will come to see that we were right.
Only the most famous warrior band in all of Skyrim. Have you been living with the horkers?
Or you could catch the carriage from Whiterun to Markarth and then approach from the west.
Patience, Brand-Shei. This is a rare opportunity, and I wouldn't want you to get left out.
Pelagius stopped by and mentioned he hated you. Or I mentioned he hated you and he agreed.
Please, will you help me get out of here? If the coast is clear, I'll make a break for it.
Proventus, you must help me. We need to convince my brother to do more for the war effort.
Relaxing? They must be working you to the bone! You should rest before you do yourself in.
Restoration is a perfectly valid school of magic, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
Riften. Cicero likes Riften. Cheats and ruffians and cutthroats abound. Finally, some fun.
Roggvir. You helped Ulfric Stormcloak escape this city after he murdered High King Torygg.
Rustleif, I've been wondering. Maybe after the baby is born, we should move to Hammerfell.
She watched while we ate it, and when she saw how much we loved it, she was... so proud...
Shor's Beard! You're right! I'll do it... provided you supervise the shipments personally.
Shouldn't you be helping me then, wife of mine? Sharing my problems? Being my better half?
So now I'm all alone. And the Jarl said I had to go to Honorhall Orphanage. It's not fair!
So... wait. Cicero is alive? And we're all friends again? I swear, I can hardly keep up...
Sssh. It's all right. You don't need to say anymore. I had no idea you were so... nuanced.
Stand in the center of the room and prepare yourself to taste the Voice of the Greybeards.
Still, having a just and honorable man like Brunwulf in charge can only be an improvement.
Sure, sure. It's just, you know, not every day I meet someone who's laid eyes on a dragon.
That armor... Are you one of the Emperor's protectors? Not very good at your job, are you?
That I will, stranger. This is more than the Silver-Bloods are paying us. We'll clear out.
That was better Ataf. Add a bit of emphasis on [QUOTE]Ragnar[QUOTE] and [QUOTE]Red.[QUOTE]
That's a shame. Too many people in Riften share your view and look where its getting them.
The ancient Nords were a savage people, but they built some remarkable crypts and temples.
The Empire already took my daughter from us, but by Talos they will not take our homeland!
The Empire has always been good to the Orcs, but this war of theirs is none of my concern.
The guards are looking for a killer, but who knows what else they might turn up? Good day.
The Guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly.
The heat of battle is the fire that forges the strongest blades. It's an old Nord proverb.
The Nightingales protect the temple of Nocturnal, a place known as the Twilight Sepulcher.
The Oath has been struck, the die has been cast and your fate awaits you in the Evergloam.
The oldest fighting group in Skyrim, and nothing but glory from Ysgramor's day to our own.
The only thing we're lacking is a reliable way to transport our merchandise across Skyrim.
The same place I learned my charm and quick wits: I used to be an Imperial ranger, my boy!
The vapors are waning, but not yet gone. Take a breath. Peryite will speak if He sees fit.
There is a letter, one I have had for some time now. I think it is time it gets delivered.
There's bound to be resistance. There are many Stormcloak camps tucked away in the hills. 
There's still Imperial camps to be cleaned up, as you know. And that takes arms and armor.
They've barricades to block us, but we'll tear through them and the Imperials behind them!
Think that's water in the river? Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth, friend.
This group... this family... this band... this is the best thing I've ever been a part of.
This heap of matchsticks is what everyone calls Haelga's Bunkhouse. Can you stay here? No.
This here is Dragonsreach, an' it's my task to see it looks fit for a jarl, night an' day.
This is far as I can take you. Krif voth ahkrin. I will look for your return, or Alduin's.
This is how a warrior should feel. Alive and aware. Not clouded with thoughts of the hunt.
This is preposterous. Disrespect... insulting! I am tired of being hounded from all sides!
This looks good. You put time into your blades, they'll serve you well when you need them.
This place must be cleansed. These draugr were once living beings and they deserve better.
This time let's try [QUOTE]The Age of Aggression[QUOTE]. I will demonstrate for the class.
This time let's try [QUOTE]The Age of Oppression[QUOTE]. I will demonstrate for the class.
Thorald... Thorald Gray-Mane? Fighting for the Stormcloaks, disappeared and believed dead?
To be driven from our homes, to be forced here... this is the last thing that Joric needs.
To guide its people through this time of transition, to help lead them to a better future.
Torsten was gratified the death of his daughter was avenged and the heirloom was returned.
Ulfric will allow Imperial troops to enter Winterhold. Korir will replace Kraldar as Jarl.
Umurn and Nagrub will be held up as weak next to the son I will one day bear for my chief.
Vald was tasked with getting it here safely and it ended up at the bottom of Lake Honrich.
Very well. But should the hunger call out to you, I'll be waiting outside Reachcliff Cave.
Was. Forsworn came in the night. Killed everyone. Gat and I are the only ones who escaped.
We made a pact that one day, we might reunite... but I believe that day is long in coming.
We manage to break that mare and bring her back here, we can sell her for a small fortune.
We remember all those Solitude soldiers out fighting the good fight in this thankless war.
We understand the Nightgate and Roughwater inns are frequent stops for Stormcloak runners.
We want Kraldar removed as Jarl of Winterhold, and an Imperial candidate put in his place.
We will honor our agreement in this life and the next until your conditions have been met.
We've been here as long as either of us can remember, though. So try to show some respect.
Well, I used to sneak out at night and try to tip over the big ox in the Gray-Manes' yard.
Well, I'll want to meet them next time they're around. Maybe you can give an introduction.
Well, not yet. The Empire hasn't been in charge for that long, and real change takes time.
Well, nothing. At least not any more. Folk just call me that because of what I used to do.
Well, suffice to say she is resplendent, but not without resolve. Striking, in all senses.
Well, you did something Vex couldn't do at Goldenglow, so you're looking pretty damn good.
Well! Same congratulations apply! Just, you know, for what you did for the insane emperor.
What? What trickery is this? You're not going anywhere until I find out what you're up to!
While you're doing that, I'll work on getting you an invitation to Elenwen's little party.
Wonderful. Soon we'll have the latest section of the Edda complete. Keep up the good work.
Wuunferth. There have been rumors swirling about him for years. As long as I can remember.
Yes, of course you are right. Still, I would give much for even a few grains of moonsugar.
You don't want to be part of history? Fine. I'll be at the shrine if you change your mind.
You get a generous amount of gold, I get to complete my collection, and nobody has to die.
You get used to it after a while... kind of smells like the hot springs out in the tundra.
You have quite a house. I'm thinking of setting up a small store here. Sell odds and ends.
You must deliver those items to your superior. And I... I must get out of this foul place.
You must either be crazy or supremely confident to go walking around with no clothes on...
You need a book, you talk to me. Otherwise you're going to find yourself in a lot of pain.
You start flapping that jaw of yours or I'll start flapping it for you. You understand me?
You want the hilt that bad? Fine. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.
You went right out to give it to your fiancee! Don't you even remember where you left her?
You went right out to give it to your fiancee! Don't you even remember where you left him?
You were just standing there when you were supposed to be serving drinks to our customers!
You, too, huh? I'd much rather a straight up fight than creeping around a place like this.
You're that Mage from the College. Right? Hear things have finally calmed down over there.
You've been a beacon of hope in these dark times for my people and I will never forget it.
You've broken the rules and now you need to pay... and it's going to cost you quite a bit.
You've done me a great service, my friend. Allow me to compensate you for the information.
Your first target is an Orc bard named Lurbuk. The other is a vampire by the name of Hern.
'Accidents' like this don't just happen! Someone is trying to sabotage my uncle's research!
[QUOTE]Check the shipments[QUOTE] Lisbet says. [QUOTE]There are no shipments[QUOTE] I says.
A few of us are either too stubborn or too crazy to go, so we do our best to make a living.
After all that it's been through, the College still stands. In no small part thanks to you!
Ah, but you care little for politics, am I right? You want money! And money you shall have!
Ah, good. A lot of weapons and armor need leather for straps, fittings, that kind of thing.
All right, head on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach is smarter than you think.
All the wood furniture in this inn is rotting to the core. Do you know why that is, Kleppr?
And I'm a porter with no shipments coming in. You're not getting any coin from me, Degaine.
And the Voice, he did wield, on that glorious field, when great Tamriel shuddered with war!
Aren't you worried someone will wander in here? The entrance isn't exactly hidden you know.
At least something good came out of that trip to Saarthal. I didn't find anything but dust.
At the same time, this tether will bolster the agent's own life force, making him stronger.
Aye, and she's added more traps now as well... A moment of silence for our fallen friend...
Ayleid, Dwemer, Daedric... Not even Falmer. None of them are a match. Quite curious indeed.
Be careful around the burial stones. I don't want to haul you back to Jorrvaskr on my back.
Before I can present you with the title, there's but a single requirement you must fulfill.
Before my ma and da passed, I told them that one day, I'd become the best trader in Skyrim.
Before you can stand next to your shield brother, you need to be able to stand on your own.
Better to stick together. I don't want you to get yourself killed before we even get there.
Brand-Shei, did you hear about Helgen? It's... it's gone! A dragon burned it to the ground!
Business? Business is actually inconsequential to me. I share little of your lust for coin.
But in your case, Dragonborn, it is a privilege to guide you towards mastery of your Voice.
But that may just be because I remember when you were just a whelp who was begging to join.
But then came the Tongues on that terrible day. Steadfast as winter, they entered the fray.
By Nord custom, once the challenge was issued in court, Torygg had no choice but to accept.
By Shor, is that... is that Azura's Star? How did you come to possess such a rare treasure?
Camilla, I've seen her talking to that Faendal. Filthy elf needs to keep to his own kind...
Come now! You're joking with old Nazir! Surely the Emperor's life was worth more than that.
Come see me in the market if you're looking for the finest custom jewelry in all of Skyrim.
Cross the river and then head north. You'll see Whiterun on its hill as you pass the falls.
Dinya? I was reading that missive you gave me and I was wondering something about marriage.
Don't be such a coward. We haven't seen any draugr since the mine was cleared. Be grateful.
Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it mead. These terms are still not acceptable.
Don't miss out... purchase a bottle of my genuine Falmerblood Elixir! Only 20 septims each!
Don't plan on bringing anything else in with you. The Thalmor take security very seriously.
Don't take too long figuring it out. Might mistake your hesitation for Imperial sympathies.
Don't you understand the danger? Don't you understand what the return of the dragons means?
Each bolt of yarn used to make the robe was colored with a dye made from sacrificial blood.
Easy. Here. These are the keys. The hilt is in a chest in my house, just don't hurt anyone.
Even we who ride the currents of Time cannot see past Time's end. Wuldsetiid los tahrodiis.
Every mage in this College regularly uses wards for practice, so as to avoid physical harm.
Everyone knows the Thieves Guild uses the old sewer system beneath Riften as their hideout.
Everyone thinks Thorald is dead. But not me. I know my boy is alive out there. Somewhere...
Excellent. I can move more soldiers through the area now that I know those scouts are dead.
Father, I promise you, this has nothing to do with Empires or politics. It's just business.
Feel free to grab a pick and help them out. I prefer not to sully myself with manual labor.
For now, perhaps. But I've heard disturbing rumors that they're marshalling their strength.
Good enough. I'll just confiscate any stolen goods you're carrying, then you're free to go.
Good, the place is crawling with bandits.  We lost some good men trying to take it earlier.
Good. The more time he pines for the dead wives, the less time he spends finding a new one.
Great job hitting those targets. You definitely surprised me with your speed and composure.
Guards brought me in about 12 years ago. Was running a good group of bandits up until then.
He may be permitted to return at the end of time to fulfill his destiny as the World-Eater.
He's a damn tyrant. Always being goaded on by the Silver-Bloods to get more work out of us.
Here. Give Camilla this letter. It's full of venomous nonsense. Tell her it's from Faendal.
Here. You were promised a reward for solving the crime, but I need one more favor from you.
Hjaalmarch would allow us to directly threaten the Imperial supply lines out of Solitude...
Hmm. We could use the time to bring in new recruits. Our losses have been heavy recently...
Hmph. [QUOTE]Solitude.[QUOTE] Lonely Cicero could tell you a thing or two about solitude...
How about a test? Your muscle against mine. The victor gains 100 gold coins from the loser.
How can they continue to lead their already meager lives with dark clouds looming overhead?
I am loath to utter his name... one cannot erase a thing if it has a name to be remembered.
I can't believe Silus is collecting Mythic Dawn artifacts. Right here in Dawnstar, no less.
I could easily provide my spells to your cause. Protect you from harm. Defeat your enemies.
I don't get many customers, but that leaves me time to try things out. Experiment, I guess.
I don't know what persuaded you to assist me when we met in Dawnstar, but I'm glad you did.
I don't know what you overheard, but the Riverwood Trader is still open. Feel free to shop.
I don't know who you are, or what's going on here, but you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
I hid here in Solitude for a long time but war, war follows a man until it's done with him.
I just got a ransom note for it. That flute has been handed down for seventeen generations!
I might ask the same of you. For you are more than mortal. You are moon-born. You are wolf.
I never knew much about Weylin, except he lives in the Warrens, like all the other workers.
I ought to get back to work before I'm missed, but... did anyone else escape? Did Ulfric...
I really need your help! I don't want to lose my job at the fishery! What am I going to do?
I should get over to Windhelm more. See how the other Morrowind refugees are getting along.
I should have known this would end badly. I can't believe I let Delphine talk me into this.
I suppose that'll do. Dibella teaches us forgiveness, after all. Even for a drunk like you.
I surrender! Give me a few hours to gather my household, and I'll depart. You have my word.
I take what little business I can git. I'm grateful for anyone willin' to spend money here.
I visit the temple sometimes, but perhaps not often enough. Thanks for bringing this to me.
I was almost beginning to think Gavros had gone and gotten himself killed just to spite me.
I was kidnapped by these bandits weeks ago. They locked me up in the towers near Mistwatch.
I won't be the one to go back there. I won't return to Avanchnzel. You can't make me do it.
I would... eh... be interested in acquiring it. If you're willing to part with it, that is.
I... I'm impressed with your initiative. Of course, someone will need to follow up on this.
I'd do anything to have that whore's head on a platter. All I need to know is where she is.
I'll be sure to check [QUOTE]Talk to random stranger[QUOTE] off my list of today's tasks...
I'm afraid not. How else can a poor, overworked sailor like myself expect to earn a living?
I'm glad Brynjolf decided to let me join. Been trying to make some coin for him ever since.
I'm glad you came. It's been a long time since we had a heart like yours among our numbers.
I'm not afraid of anyone. Put a sword in my hand and I could defend this place if I had to!
I'm not really sure. Made and used by Magnus himself, if you believe those sorts of things.
I'm not saying it wouldn't be useful. But there are better uses of our resources right now.
I'm sorry my lady. The stresses of all this research... it's becoming more than I can bear.
I'm sorry. I was curious... I didn't believe the stories. I won't go over there ever again.
I've never been a smart one. But the Companions welcome anyone with the heart of a warrior.
I've spent my life serving Talos. I don't plan to stop now, no matter what the Empire says.
I've tried to explain to Lurbuk that his [QUOTE]singin'[QUOTE] is gonna get his throat cut.
If word got out that I'm practicing my Dibellan Arts in Riften, they'll run me out of town.
If you can travel there, and retrieve our young Sybil, your transgression will be forgiven.
If you wondering why they call me Vipir the Fleet, watch me outrun the town guard sometime.
If you're interested, I could point out a good place that could use a little housecleaning.
If you're looking to hire the strongest mercenary in Skyrim, I'd wager your search is over.
Incredible... imagine the manpower and ingenuity needed to carve the buildings of Markarth.
Indeed, you saw more clearly than I - certainly more clearly than Alduin. Rok funta koraav.
Iron-Breaker Mine is three times the worth of that Quicksilver Mine and its fat-head owner.
It is a hard time for all of us. I hope that you too can find some sanctuary here, Mathies.
It was a simple task, so I didn't keep close tabs on it like I do with the dangerous stuff.
It was all before my time, you understand. I've heard the stories, the same as anyone else.
It's not like my poaching is hurting anyone. The Jarl can hardly eat every deer now can he?
It's these nightmares. Me and every one of my workers can't catch a nod without having one.
Jarl Skald is upset over the loss of Dawnstar. I'll admit, it's less I have to worry about.
Just have them focus on the calm in the battle. Control the rage, don't let it control you.
Just remember that you're only a part of my court, this doesn't make you one of the family.
Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lad. This will be a fight to remember!
Lazy good-for-nothing, isn't he? Sent you down here when I'm a stone's throw from the keep?
Let it beat with ours, that the mountains may echo and our enemies may tremble at the call.
Let's see what you have for me today. Something simple to turn around for a profit I trust.
Look at this one. Spoiled as a child, I'll bet. Allowed to leave trash just lying around...
Look at you, almost a grown man! Won't be long before you'll be joining the fight yourself.
Look old woman. If your boy wants to learn how to fight, we'll teach him. Now off with you.
Lore holds that the Skull of Corruption holds a constant hunger for the memories of others.
Make sure you make him pay for what he did to Gallus... heck, for what he did to all of us.
Maybe. That stuff's gettin' tough to bring across the border with all the Argonian patrols.
Mind you don't get fresh with Susanna. She plays the flirt, but it's just to get good tips.
Mjoll's brought me nothing but safety and piece of mind... and some lessons with the blade.
Mother thought I should be taught a lesson for airing the family's dirty laundry in public.
My brother Jon's got the right of it - join the Bards College and avoid this pointless war.
My children, Sibbi and Ingun, are being groomed to run the family business one day as well.
My choice, then? Very well. I think we should add some Chaurus eggs. For additional flavor.
My family owns this inn, but I've put Kleppr in charge. Right rat for the right job, I say.
My parents dropped me off here a year ago. But they're coming back to get me. They said so.
My sister and I once traveled the world to assemble our collection. Such adventures we had!
My sister Gerdur runs the mill in Riverwood, just up the road. I'm sure she'd help you out.
Nervous being alone at night. Especially these days, with the Butcher prowling the streets.
New around Riften? Take my advice. Stay at the Bee and Barb... the Bunkhouse isn't for you.
Nice try, but my mother's already got me in jail. Maybe you should try that one on Letrush.
No matter what else happens, the guards will always be grateful for everything you've done.
Not on the way back. Once she gets there, it's not up to me to decide what's done with her.
Nothing. I'm busy, and I don't like being bothered unless I'm expecting something from you.
Now that's good work. Everyone will be a lot safer with them gone, Dark Elf and Nord alike.
Of course! I would do anything for you, my one and truest friend! What do you need from me?
Oh, Bolli you silly man. You weren't saying that when you were licking that honey off my...
Oh, Rogatus! Maybe tomorrow will be pleasant for once, hmm? It can't be terrible every day!
Oh, the Listener, well... listens! The Night Mother speaks to you. Guides you on your path.
Oh, well... You seem to already have assistance. Surely you mean to remain inconspicuous...
Oh, you've seen your father just trying to chase a skeever from his house. He's a bit soft.
On second thought, maybe I'm better off in here. At least I'll die with a clear conscience.
Once again, I have found very insulting notes left in my personal effects. Simply barbaric.
Pa says the Empire made us leave, but the Empire just does whatever the elves tell them to.
Reasons? Since when does a man need a reason to protect his family, to defend his homeland?
Riften remains allied to the Stormcloak cause, under the authority of Jarl Laila Law-Giver.
See, I knew we could resolve this civilly. A debt owed must be repaid. You understand that.
She's put me in charge of keeping the mead flowing, so that's exactly what I'm going to do.
So I had this little affair going on while I was betrothed to a beautiful girl named Svidi.
So it's true, then. For now, it's enough to know that he's alive. I can find peace in that.
So we're going to go have a little chat with him, and find out exactly what it is he wants.
So, Arniel. How's that little project of yours coming along? Any progress worth mentioning?
Solitude wouldn't be the same without the Fire Festival. City owes you a debt of gratitude.
Some call me a mercenary, but I like to think of myself as a freelance adventurer for hire.
Something's happening to bring the dragons back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.
Soul gems are the subject, friend. They're used in enchanting, then they break. Except one.
Spare me your pitiful pride. You are but a tool of my ambitions, mortal. Never forget that.
Steal from anywhere in the hold, and you even get to keep everythin' you stole. So, you in?
Tacitus? Boy's an Imperial. I keep showing him how to treat the iron, but he never gets it.
That sounds precisely like the sort of thing that should matter to everyone. Especially me.
The Daedric Lord Vaermina's voracious hunger for memories is responsible for these visions.
The guards won't help. The people won't help. I'm the only one who thinks he can be caught.
The old tales say that he is able to travel into Sovngarde to devour the souls of the dead.
The one who sells things, what's his name. Oh, yes! Revyn Sadri. Maybe he'd know something.
The only reason I'm here is because my refusal to attend would cause a diplomatic incident.
The only thing I dislike about my husband's homeland is the cold. Why is it always so cold?
The people of Skyrim are more open minded about certain things than people in other places.
The power to unmake the world at my fingertips, and you think you can do anything about it?
The quill was supposed to allow me to duplicate any writing I'm viewing in exacting detail.
The resistance against the Dominion is alive and well in Hammerfell, and they want justice.
The Sanctuary is in the southern Pine Forest. Close to the road, but away from prying eyes.
The weather's harsh, but I like to think my sunny personality is what helps the grain grow.
Their greatest achievement, however, has also been their greatest, shall we say... Mystery.
Then again, Nelacar might know. He's an old-timer from the College, but he has a room here.
Then allow me to officially welcome you to Riften. You'll make a fine addition to our city.
There, there. It will pass. Going too long without a proper meal can make the stomach weak.
These bandits would stab each other in the back if it meant an extra coin in their pockets.
They say he killed twelve of the Imperial Legion and shattered their bones with his breath.
They're built like small fortresses to resist the weather, but their one weakness is flame.
They're scared of the dragons, too, aren't they? Paying too well. They don't know anything.
This isn't a damn summer picnic! Hurry up. We need to hit them before they know we're here.
This looks like the guardian chamber. The key to that door has to be around here somewhere.
Those big, powerful blows are tiring. Pace yourself until you've got the stamina to do one.
Thought it was fitting I suppose. I never changed it, because it never felt right to do so.
To kill triplets, secretly, and then have the whole thing blamed on the mother. Remarkable.
To restore Master Elgrim's supply I would need 20 deathbell, 20 nightshade and 20 nirnroot.
Try Olfina, the new innkeeper at the Bannered Mare. It's just up the road, near the market.
Ugh. You're the most disgusting merchant I have ever seen. The guards should take you away.
Unfortunately, thanks to some problems they've been having, it hasn't seen much use lately.
Vekel and me, we have a thing going. Try anything with him and it'd be bad for your health.
We don't get many visitors through here, unless their headed up to High Hrothgar of course.
We drink to our youth, to days come and gone. For the age of aggression is just about done.
We need saviors to free us from Alduin's rage. Heroes on the field of this new war to wage.
We sold all those lovely little necklaces you brought me today. Did you make them yourself?
We're not kicking you out, just keep the sermons at the temple and let us all sin in peace.
We've decided this will be your Trial. Do well, and you'll be counted among the Companions.
Weddings always make me cry. What am I supposed to do now that I'm the one getting married?
Welcome. Let me know if you want anything... think I got a clean mug around here somewhere.
Well aren't we the eager one? Sorry to disappoint, but there's nothing. Try me again later.
Well nobody asked you. If you think you're better than we are, go talk to Kodlak Whitemane.
Well, look what the horker dragged in. Still wandering all over Skyrim and causing trouble?
Well... you did show remarkable initiative. And you didn't have to bring the crown to me...
What are you, blind? That store is empty. Forsworn get almost every shipment that comes in.
What would you have me do, send him to the gallows for treason? He's your brother, Harrald.
What's the matter with you? You think you can just go dropping your junk wherever you like?
When I woke from cold death, my doom was lifted - there was Shor's Hall, my heart's desire.
When you learn a Shout, you take it into your very being. In a sense, you become the Shout.
Where did you keep all that loot?  I've been here almost a year and haven't seen any of it.
Where's Cosnach, is that lazy idiot out drinking at the Silver-Blood Inn again? On my coin?
Why didn't you say so earlier? At least now we don't have to waste time searching the area.
Why have taxes not come in from Granite Hill, Nenya? We should send some guards down there.
Without that amulet, I'm powerless to confront them. Would you be willing to search for it?
Would you mind helping me with the demonstration? Are you at all familiar with ward spells?
Years past, the lumber was used for houses or furniture. Now, the soldiers just buy it all.
Yes, you brought honor to him, even after his death. A worthy outcome for a worthy warrior.
Yes. I think I am. You can Shout now. That can only mean one thing. You must be Dragonborn.
Yes. Perhaps one day I'll be able to make the journey, but for now I need to tend the dead.
Yes. Well, I didn't respond as quickly to the Legate's suggestion as perhaps I should have.
You best rethink this course of action or you may find yourself on the executioner's block.
You buy a war dog from me? There's a reason why my hounds are so eager to bite into people.
You can't deny the fact that he needs to give back to his people; to fight to keep us free.
You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If so, let her prove it.
You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If so, let him prove it.
You could say I'm a King's man at heart. Hmph. I guess that's [QUOTE]Jarl's man[QUOTE] now.
You don't have to say sorry to me. I just hope the Eight bring us more peace in the future.
You have helped rid the Orcs of Yamarz in a way that avoids the destruction of their tribe.
You like creepin' around in the shadows? Magic'll work just as good there as anywhere else.
You really want to help? You go offer yourself at Malacath's Shrine. Petition him for help.
You should think harder on your oath to the Emperor next time you're deciding what's right.
You there. We are looking for someone in Whiterun, and will pay good money for information.
You want to know the one truth I've learned in all my years? Life's too hard to face sober.
You would violate this marvel of Kynareth's glory to fix that half-breed stump in Whiterun?
You! Fetcher! I should kill you for assaulting my family. But I will accept your apology...
You... you were talking to that murderous savage. And then he escaped. What are you hiding?
You're... probably right. Just hurry, please. Who knows what those things are doing to her.
You've got a fine look about you. Come have a visit at the Braidwood Inn. Better than home!
Your Voice in particular is likely to intrigue this dragon, after your victory over Alduin.
Zu'u bonaar. You went to a great deal of trouble to put me in this... humiliating position.
...Forsworn think they're so scary... Cicero will show you who's scary... Stupid Forsworn...
Ah yes, quite an amusing anecdote actually. I caught him trying to break into my laboratory.
Ah, contracts like that are few and far between, it seems. Makes me long for the old days...
Ah, Indara. Arkay's blessing upon you and your husband. Spend as much time here as you need.
Ah, the feisty goodwife. Quite the mouth on her. Someone must have wanted her dead... right?
Ahhh... Vasha, at your service. Obtainer of goods, taker of lives, and defiler of daughters.
Aia, this is a delicate matter. Why don't you review your lessons and be silent for a while.
Alduin's Wall was created by the ancient Akaviri Dragonguard, the forerunners of the Blades.
All he found in my pocket was a tiny smooth stone inscribed with some sort of strange runes.
All I need is a dozen men and we could march into the Ratway and burn them out like rodents.
Almost the opposite. The College got rid of something... someone, that was too much trouble.
Also, their placement throughout Skyrim does not correspond to any known magical phenomenon.
An excellent question. Vittoria Vici is the first cousin to our dear Emperor, Titus Mede II.
And I've seen the face of evil. It was in the air above Sentinel on the Night of Green Fire.
And now it's within my grasp... but the Eight, it seems, have chosen me for their amusement.
And then, send that jester's twisted little soul to the Void, in as many pieces as possible.
And those are just the physical threats. Assaults on his sanity are another matter entirely.
Another drink, Cosnach? A porter with Arnleif and Sons deserves nothing but the finest here.
Are you my gallant hero? Have you come to whisk me away, to a life of adventure and romance?
Are you sure you don't want something for them? I may be able to brew you something to help.
Assur is going to grow up to be a great man, because he'll have lived through such hardship.
Azura has seen your coming, traveler. It was not curiosity, but fate, that has led you here.
Bah. My organization's been having a run of bad luck, but I suppose that's just how it goes.
Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor. My belly is full of the souls of your fellow mortals, Dovahkiin.
Beggars roam the streets, crime runs rampant and the threat of war is driving away business.
Bottle... their flame? I can't... No, I don't think I've any interest in that sort of thing.
Brother Casimir, you must activate the barrier and release the Miasma. Let nothing stop you.
But even if you could get to the Eldergleam, you couldn't tap it. Not with any normal metal.
But I don't want to be a sailor or a farmer. I want to be a warrior! The strongest one ever!
But let's not jump to any conclusions, or assign it importance beyond what we're certain of.
But Odahviing, he is... headstrong? Boziik. Rash. Even among the dov, he was known for this.
But Shor restrained our wrathful onslaught - perhaps, deep-counselled, your doom he foresaw.
But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red, when he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said...
But there are risks. There are always risks. You must summon and command an unbound Dremora.
But we should be done with murders in the Blue Palace. I've stepped up security around here.
Can you believe that fool had the audacity to speak of his love for the Empire in the plaza?
Can you imagine what it was like, living here so long ago? The first men in Tamriel, here...
Can't you bother me at my armor stand in the market? Or are you that desperate for training?
Cedran said he'd... what am I paying you for? Next time, you bring the shipment in yourself.
Come on, this way. I've seen the guards use it to get rid of bodies. It must lead somewhere.
Come on, Ulfric. You have to give a little ground here. The dragons are a threat to us both.
Did you hear? People have been seen coming in and out of the Black Door. Divines have mercy.
Did you know it was his decree that forbade the Argonians from living inside the city walls?
Do not allow Ataxia to fester. A smart warrior keeps a potion to cure diseases at all times.
Do you really believe he would honor our agreement, or go running off to the highest bidder?
Don't get me wrong, he could scam a beggar out of his last septim... but he's no mastermind.
Dragonborn... Perhaps this is the fate of Skyrim after all. To be destroyed from the inside.
Enchanting services are one of the few things that keep us in touch with the rest of Skyrim.
Esbern? He's alive? I thought the Thalmor must have got him years ago. That crazy old man...
Even with the College's laid-back attitude, there are still some things that are off-limits.
Faida came by today. She says you left the tavern last night without paying for your drinks.
Fair or not, they'll pay it, and that's all I need to care about. Bear that in mind, sister.
Falkreath is known for its graveyard, traveler. We've buried more dead than you can imagine.
Fancy a crawl through a moldering dungeon to see if you can't stir up Galmar's Jagged Crown?
Farewell, then. If you need my services again, just come and look for me in the usual place.
Feel free to look around. Come talk to me when you're ready to discuss that job I mentioned.
Find enemy controlled resources like sawmills, flour-mills, and smelters, and sabotage them.
Funny thing is his stupid Thieves Guild never counted on me and my partner blocking the way.
Giving up Riften is a heavy price to pay for this truce, Dragonborn. I hope it was worth it.
Go tell the commander. I'm sure the boot in your arse will take your mind off your troubles.
Good to hear. You can be a difficult woman to find. Thankfully those couriers are tenacious.
Greetings, sister. You look weary. I have something to help you relax, if you're interested.
Grelod, you old crone. You'll get what you deserve. The Dark Brotherhood will see to that...
Had they placed their faith in magic instead of machinery, the Dwemer might still be around.
Hail, Dragonborn. That honor is also mine - to our shared birthright you'll bring new glory!
Have you ever heard of the expression, [QUOTE]the scale of the Argonian that bit you?[QUOTE]
He's harmless. He's been in a state ever since his sister Reyda disappeared over a year ago.
He's proud of his service, Skald. The Legion taught us loyalty. And we're loyal to Dawnstar.
Heard of them? I've been captaining a crew for 'em well on nine years now. What's it to you?
Hello there fellow, traveler. One itinerant minstrel and wandering wastrel, at your service.
Here, I want you to have this. It was my father's but I'm certain you'll put it to good use.
Hopefully small things that fit inside pockets, and will not be noticed if they are missing.
How long are we going to let Ranmir drink himself into a stupor? When will enough be enough?
Hrongar became the Jarl when his brother Balgruuf, who had the job before him, was murdered.
Hrongar, calm yourself. What does any of this Nord nonsense have to do with our friend here?
I appreciate your help. Please, take this. Some gold I've saved up from working at the mill.
I beg of you, look for proof of Thorald's capture. The Battle-Borns have it, I just know it.
I can see why they built the fort here. A small force could control most of the nearby land.
I can't imagine what that might be, but if it's safe, you might see if they were successful.
I do, and if you count yourself among their numbers then you've blood on your hands as well.
I don't bother with silly pickpocketing jobs when I can make far more at the gambling table.
I don't know who in Windhelm would even have something like that. Other than me, of course. 
I don't know who told you that, but I'll do what I can. What we do have are plenty of books.
I have the knowledge I need. And so you may have your stone back, and also please take this.
I have to admit I didn't think it would actually be there.  Now let's take a look at this...
I hear you found some... thing in Saarthal. You think it could help make me a powerful mage?
I hold you responsible for this situation. So, you better win me back Riften, or die trying.
I hope they'll serve the roast venison with bittergreen sauce that we had at the last party.
I hope this all gets straightened out soon or I'm headed on the first caravan out of Riften.
I know my father would be worried about me. I'm here to let him know everything's all right.
I know my mother would be worried about me. I'm here to let her know everything's all right.
I must have spent every last coin I've made with the Guild trying to find out what it means.
I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great import to Jarl Hrongar of Whiterun.
I need to get back to Markarth. Here, take this. It's the least I can do for saving my life.
I owe a great deal of money to someone and I think they cheated me. I don't know what to do.
I protest! This is an insult to the dignity of my person! This time I'm completely innocent!
I really don't have time to deal with you right now. Please just let me get back to my work.
I saw Caius.. that dragon just grabbed him and... I don't know how I made it out of there...
I sent a blessing to Mundus, a wasting plague that infected a scattering of Breton villages.
I think they wanted to break me. Use me as a way to get to the rest of the Gray-Mane family.
I was hoping you could help me. It seems I've lost a ring that also means quite a bit to me.
I will not stand for betrayal. I want you to go to Bthardamz and kill Orchendor, in my name.
I will send down a ray of light. Guide this light through my temple and its doors will open.
I won't rest until Mercer's dead. How could he murder Gallus and betray all of us like that?
I'd prove to be quite an asset to the Thieves Guild... I'm one of the best fences in Skyrim.
I'd rather see the Sea of Ghosts swallow Winterhold entirely than have it run by the Empire.
I'd say we're prosperous enough. Most folk don't go hungry, if they're willing to work hard.
I'm good with stars and charts, but I admit I've got some things to learn about leading men.
I'm one of the few native sons of the Reach that owns land. It doesn't make me very popular.
I'm only hoping whatever means he used to learn the language will still be available to you.
I'm supposed to allow you to trade in one of your pieces of Guild armor, so what will it be?
I've been meaning to speak to you, Niranye. Rumor is, you've got ties to the Thieves' Guild.
I've heard you may actually be stronger than you look. Perhaps we can hunt together someday.
I've made up my mind, even if my advisors are still squabbling. I'm sending you to Windhelm.
If he gets his hands on them, you can be certain he'll be gone for good and set up for life.
If we could get into the Thalmor Embassy... it's the center of their operations in Skyrim...
If you find anyone you think would make a good recruit, I can certainly take a look at them.
If you keep it in close, you'll have more control, but it can be harder to balance a strike.
If you're ever in the market, I deal in specialty goods from Morrowind at one of the stands.
If you're not sure maybe you don't belong here. I'll ask again, are we clear on all of this?
In some parts of the world, wielding a weapon openly like that is an invitation to combat...
It is a thankless task and I would rather be back home in Elsweyr, but I have little choice.
It is the Champion of Namira! I was just about to eat. Here, you should have the first bite.
It was a stupid plan, and now Rigel is so mad she won't even let us cut him down from there!
It'll be a fairly slow moving caravan. The shipment is quite heavy, and guarded by many men.
It's filthy in there! Dirt everywhere, and it looks like the dogs have the run of the place.
It's simple Orc smithing practice, my chief. Nothing that hasn't been passed down for years.
Jarl Brina Merilis is in charge, thanks to the Empire. Best hide any Talos amulets you have.
Just between us, I've got more important things to do than attend these meaningless parties.
Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lass. This will be a fight to remember!
Kraldar's family was once very powerful in Winterhold. It's my honor to assist him even now.
Laila, Riften is my home, but if my meadery can't be safe here, I'll just move it elsewhere.
Lisette's a fine lass, but when I join the Legion, she's not the type to wait for my return.
Listen, Roggvir and I grew up together. It was us, a few others and Vivienne. Vivienne Onis.
Listen, wench, we're on to you. We know who you are, so you'd better come with us right now!
Look, I'm done here. Mop the floor with these idiots for all I care. Just get out of my way.
Luckily there's no shortage of Pit bait around here. Now get in there and earn your freedom.
M'aiq knows why Falmer are blind. It has nothing to do with the Dwemer disappearing. Really.
M'aiq was soul trapped once. Not very pleasant. You should think about that once in a while.
Madena, I was wondering if you could help me with something. Your magic would be invaluable.
Make your way to our camp in the Rift. We have a few surprises for the Stormcloaks lined up.
Many condemn the Stormcloaks, but I refuse. There is honor in fighting for what you believe.
Maybe a hardy Nord like you doesn't need a cure-all. Hmm? What about an invisibility potion?
Maybe a little influence from your old uncle Sanguine could help adjust your course a bit...
Maybe it is. Look, I want to go back but I won't feel right in there without a tie to Talos.
Mmmm, careful with that, Nenya, our merchants could be selling weapons to an invading force.
More importanly, he's pledged the full support of the Battle-Born clan to the Thieves Guild.
Most of our weapons were crafted by Adrianne Avenicci. My woman's an artist, is what she is.
My brother Anoriath and I came up with it one night after consuming... rather too much mead.
My brother Roggvir wore a symbol of Talos. He kept it hidden on his person. If I had that...
My brother's a good-for-nothing drunk. We'd have lost the house by now if it were up to him.
My joints ache, I can't eat nothin' and my head feels like a furnace. I've seen better days.
My sister Deeja will be at the wreck with our Blackblood Marauders. She knows to expect you.
Next time a Black-Briar asks for something, I suggest you respond quickly and affirmatively.
No, not yet. We'll wait for the Moot to name me High King. It'll be better for all that way.
No. I was too afraid to look. I don't know what we're going to do now. We have nothing left.
No. I will have no part of any such Empire. And I will gladly gut anyone who says otherwise.
No. That was an ugly affair. High King Torygg's death has turned the whole town on its head.
Nonsense, dear. I've had more visitors than ever seeking the wisdom of the hearth goddesses.
Not a student of history I see. It's for the best. They're a group that should be forgotten.
Not to mention the benefit of wards! How can they continually overlook wards! It's baffling!
Nothing would please me more. I'll keep their eyes away while you do what you came here for.
Now, just a moment. Let's think about this... you know, discuss it like two rational people.
Oh, and one last thing. Here, I want you to take this. It's sort of a tradition around here.
Oh, fine. Have my boon and be done with it. I've got more interesting deals to make, anyway.
Oh, I always knew my Thorald was alive. Ain't a man in Skyrim who can keep a Gray-Mane down.
Oh, it's you. I didn't think you could handle this on your own. Did you get rid of Christer?
Oh, you don't have to worry about any problems from me. I do what I'm told. Congratulations!
Oh... thank you. I don't understand what's happening. I can't stay here. What will I do now?
Once again, I must ask that everyone please clean up any materials used in the common areas.
Or you can try your luck with one of the court wizards around Skyrim. They also sell spells.
Perhaps Karliah and Brynjolf misjudged you and your true nature is no different than my own.
Perhaps they moved on to greener pastures. Whatever the reason, lets be glad they're scarce.
Please don't do anything to anger the locals. They don't need additional reasons to hate us.
Please forgive my mood. I'm still coming to terms with the death of my wife and daughters...
Powerful men have many enemies. More so, in times of strife. So you can imagine the dangers.
Present Ri'saad with this satchel of Moon Sugar, and I bet my last septim he'll make a deal.
Really, I wish my girl would read more. It would certainly keep her out of all those fights.
Remember Uncle Sinderion? These are the plants he was searching for... the Crimson Nirnroot.
Sharp, aren't they? This was the last thing many saw before they were sacrificed in my name.
She ran away when the war started. Her husband, Thonnir, was devastated. No note or nothin'.
She's right. I'll be forever in your debt, dearest brother. Now be quiet. Just... just rest.
She's the Master-Wizard here. Arch-Mage Aren may be in charge, but Mirabelle runs the place.
Shor's crown! There are things ladies like us are supposed to do. We've talked about this...
So be it. If he believes it is necessary for you to learn this... we will bow to his wisdom.
Some may prefer an eternity in his Hunting Grounds, but I crave the fellowship of Sovngarde.
Some old priest buried here long ago.  I've been searching for his tomb for a few years now.
Sure. Then you wake up in the morning with your purse empty and your gear stolen. No thanks.
Take advantage of the fine food and drink. Such things have been scarce since the war began.
Thank you for bringing this to me. I'll make sure he gets his rites. Here, for your trouble.
Thank you. It's a collection of regrets that I try not to forget. Here, I promised you this.
Thanks for that bushel of apples, Marise. They're wonderful. How did you keep them so fresh?
That bard Mikael is begging for a dagger up against his throat, the way he goes on about me.
That won't be the last we hear from the Silver-Bloods, but at least we can get back to work.
That's a real shame. Gonna make it hard for you to pay a healer after we cave your skull in.
The Augur? Tragic story, really. At least, the way I heard it. But that was a long time ago.
The battle below goes ill. If Alduin does not rise to our challenge, I fear all may be lost.
The circles at the base of the Ebonmere imbue you with powers befitting a Nightingale Agent.
The conniving Khajiit. Cat like that was sure to have enemies. It's no wonder you chose him.
The idiots in Falkreath still think the best place for prisoners is that hole in the ground.
The Initiation. My mother is going to become one of those things. I can't be a part of that.
The Jarl has put out a bounty on some bandits. Here, take a look at this decree for details.
The Jarl has put out a bounty to slay a giant. Here, take a look at this decree for details.
The last traveler that traded me some said he found them at a place called Ancient's Ascent.
The Mages at the College keep to themselves for the most part, so we don't see much of them.
The only thing we need to discuss is how many men it'll take to flush them out of the hills.
The rebels are keeping some of our men prisoner there. I aim to turn that into an advantage.
The tower on that hill is our destination. People around here call it the Tower of the Dawn.
Then you're either a Stormcloak sympathizer or a fool. Either way, you're no friend of mine.
There is one who I remember well. Odahviing. He is the one to tell us where Alduin has gone.
There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!
There's been a misunderstanding. Clearly I should not be here. I shall simply take my leave.
There's no glory in war. It's just something they tell soldiers so they'll risk their lives.
There's pirates and then there's the crew of the Red Wave. They're in a class by themselves.
They'll never understand. No amount of flowers or honeyed words are going to change my mind.
They're taking it by wagon to Solitude. If you hurry, you'll catch them before they get far.
They're taking it by wagon to Windhelm. If you hurry, you'll catch them before they get far.
Things just go from bad to worse. First the war, now dragons... what's this world coming to?
Think I'm going to head out now. Take a long vacation from woodcutting, you know? Good luck.
This ain't the Dark Brotherhood. Next time, you keep the job clean and you'll get your coin.
This is the day we send a message to Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him. 
This is the East Empire Company's central warehouse. All of their shipments go through here.
This is... lovely. Calcelmo wrote this... about me? I never knew he had such feeling in him.
Though... Perhaps there's another option. I, umm, I may require further assistance from you.
Trouble is, my legs aren't what they used to be and climbing the 7,000 Steps takes its toll.
Ugh. The wine in Skyrim tastes like urine compared to the fine vintages we had in Valenwood.
Vekel and me, we have a thing going. So I recommend you keep your hands off the merchandise.
Very honorable, I'm sure, but you should not put your own honor above the freedom of Skyrim.
Very well. Here. Take this back to Brynjolf and tell him he'll have no more trouble from me.
Very well. I name your initiates Nightingale and I restore your status to the same, Karliah.
Vittoria did pretty well for herself, marrying that Asgeir. Not a bad looking fellow at all.
We got a few pieces of jewelry at the Prawn, Madesi. Want to come take a look at them later?
We have, of course, severed all ties with the mage in question, but the Jarl isn't appeased.
We study the Way of the Voice, according to the teachings of our founder, Jurgen Windcaller.
Well then [QUOTE]observe[QUOTE] from a greater distance. You're making people uncomfortable.
Well, where is it? Forgive me, but I don't dare just trust your word, no matter who you are.
Well, you know the drill. You don't see it here, it's gonna cost you extra for me to get it.
What an amazing city. I've actually never managed to visit Whiterun, but I always wanted to.
What? I'm sorry, sir, but you must have misunderstood. I'm not permitted to leave the party.
Where I go is my business. If you have a concern about my honor, bring it before the Circle.
Wulfharth was Dragonborn. Talos, too - the founder of the Empire, back in the good old days.
Yatul and I tend to dote on Mauhulakh. You know how aunts can be with their favorite nephew.
Yes, because a worthless City Orc is just what we've been waiting for. Finally, we're saved!
Yes, indeed. An entire caravan shipment of your mead taken by Imperial soldiers. What of it?
Yes... yes, that's an excellent idea. Who knows what other lost treasures we might discover?
You do that, and I'll see what I can do about recruiting some new additions to our Family...
You escaped Cidhna Mine? With Madanach? Everyone in the Warrens has been praising your name.
You have seen the young, fickle love of youth, and helped a more seasoned love find its way.
You have the ability, but you need to learn discpline if you wish to fulfill your potential.
You have to understand, it's been a long time since Brynjolf's sent me anyone I can rely on.
You idiot. He said [QUOTE]firs[QUOTE] not [QUOTE]furs.[QUOTE] It was a damn logging caravan!
You kill the giant, bring me the hammer. We go back to Largashbur, I tell everyone I did it.
You know, now that I think of it, that sounds fair. Just shove off before the others notice.
You leave him alone. I don't want to hear Skaggi telling me you've been bothering him again!
You look like someone who knows how to wield a weapon. Well, you've come to the right place.
You said a whole lot of nonsense about selling Gleda to hire a priestess for some big event.
You see, Riften is my great beast to be slain and my fortune comes from gratitude and trust.
You should go into town and talk to an elf named Nelacar. He was involved in the whole mess.
You there. Are you here to kill me? Slay the mighty Logrolf while he sits tied and helpless?
You wish to be married? It's good to see love blossoming, even during these difficult times.
You're asking me? She promised that she was sending someone who knew what they were doing...
You're going to have to sneak over to Madesi's stall and use your lockpick on the strongbox.
You're making progress, Heimvar. But my boy could still work the bellows better than you do!
Your concerns are understandable; trust is a very difficult commodity to come by these days.
[QUOTE]He sacked Winterhold his only true ally, and used magic bold to blame Solitude.[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]Next season for sure...[QUOTE] What? Uncle Calcelmo, I don't understand what you mean.
A change has swept into Solitude, like a breeze off the ocean - the Thieves Guild has come...
A cup I'll gladly raise in company with you. None have yet bested me in boasting or drinking.
Absolutely not. I prefer to be near enough to come visit but free to come and go as I please.
Again? You just had an [QUOTE]extended hunt[QUOTE] last month. To the Pine Forest, wasn't it.
Ah, a woman who lets her actions speak for her. I knew there was something I liked about you.
Alduin has returned! The World-Eater! Even now, he devours the souls of your fallen comrades!
All the Argonians at the docks are nice to me. Good thing, too, or father would run them off!
And guess who owns the Silver-Blood Inn? Not that we named it that, the people just insisted.
And if, in the process, my presence helps to deter those who might seek to do harm, so be it.
And it was only later that it was realized that this individual might... misuse such a staff.
And now that this Cicero mess has been mopped up, we can get back to the matter at hand, hmm?
And perhaps more importantly, I need to break one of our boys out of a rebel controlled fort.
And so, from that time until this, our great keep has been called [QUOTE]Dragonsreach.[QUOTE]
Are you going soft on me, Hemming? Perhaps I made the wrong choice installing you as steward.
As long as the Synod don't blame us for this mess, I have more pressing matters to deal with.
As you can see, Eldergleam's roots are large and stretch far, blocking any path to her trunk.
Ask all you want, you can't squeeze blood from a stone. Not in this part of the world anyway.
Astrid ordered me to keep an eye on you. Figured you could use a hand when the chaos erupted.
At least tell me where you're going, so we can send someone after you if you don't come back.
At Sovngarde's gates I'll meet my fate with mirthful heart, and know I fell in noblest cause.
Being brought up by a poor family, I had to learn how to steal if I wanted to make ends meet.
Bloodsuckers. Vampires. Take every precaution. One bite, and you could end up as one of them.
Business is booming, coin is flowing and everyone seems content as things keep going our way.
But he hasn't returned yet, so I'll need to wait for his account. For now, speak with Galmar.
But I digress. Here, let me give you these. They are to be delivered to your, um... superior.
But now that I know who she is, I'd say she's trying to hit the Thieves Guild where it hurts.
But she was also the best... bringing in more coin a month than some thieves heist in a year.
But the dragons are the most fearsome. Lucky for us, they don't seem to hunt along the roads.
But yes, the books. The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes.
Calcelmo. He's the Jarl's magical advisor, but he spends most of his time studying the ruins.
Carry the blessings of Mara with you, so the rest of the province may shine with her glories.
Come on, Tullius. You have to give a little ground here. The dragons are a threat to us both.
Damn it, we're blundering around in the dark here! We need to figure out who's behind it all!
Desperate times call for desperate measures. Maybe he found what he was looking for in there.
Did you just talk back to me? I'm not paid to listen. I'm paid to keep you working. Now work.
Did you know that most of Winterhold fell into the sea? I heard it's because of that College.
Do you know why I live here, at the peak of the Monahven - what you name Throat of the World?
Do... do you want something? Look, if you ain't gonna talk, or spare no coin, just go away...
Don't make me to defend the honor of my mead! It's been my friend a lot longer than you have!
Every night, I walk around the Gray Quarter and let them gray-skins know what I think of 'em.
Excellent. Once Alain is dead, I'll pay you. In gold. I've saved up a bit. I hope that'll do.
Fantastic. I was concerned I had asked for too many, but I'm glad to see you proved me wrong.
Farengar is probably puttering around in his lab. Day and night. I'm not sure he ever sleeps.
Fortunately, these doors have a weakness if you know how to exploit it. Quite simple, really.
From the look of you, I'm guessing you're more looking to cause some trouble for the Horkers.
Gallus would call her his [QUOTE]little nightingale.[QUOTE] He was absolutely smitten by her.
Get the money into the hands of one of these guards, and I'll tell you what you want to know.
Giants don't usually cause problems like this, but these ones are stirred up for some reason.
Good question. I've only set foot inside a few times myself and that was in Mercer's company.
Good. The Greybeards can teach you a lot, but don't let them turn you away from your destiny.
Good. Wait. Dead? That's not what I asked for. I... uh... you should leave. I need a drink...
Greetings, brother. You look weary. I have something to help you relax, if you're interested.
Ha! My opponent is so paralyzed with terror, no words will come. Let's be done with it, then!
Has he? I suppose he doesn't want to miss a chance to bluster about the Empire's many crimes.
He even stole that locket right off that poor murdered girl's body... or what was left of it.
He... thanked us for contacting him, but said they didn't need any more lumber at the moment.
Helvard! The guards are looking sloppy today. I want you to reduce their wages for the month.
Here, I'm entrusting you with the dagger. Bring it to Andurs and he'll take care of the rest.
Here, take this. It's an Imperial officer's sword. A fitting weapon to use against our enemy.
Here, this key will provide access to my museum. Feel free to browse for as long as you wish.
High Hrothgar is a very peaceful place. Very... disconnected from the troubles of this world.
His door to Sovngarde is at Skuldafn, one of his ancient fanes high in the eastern mountains.
His shrine lies northwest of Largashbur. I am unsure that he will listen, but it cannot hurt.
Hmm. You may have a point. I'm always surprised by how seriously the Nords take these things.
I assume you saw the Gildergreen? Big tree, all burnt up, in the middle of the Wind District.
I bet the two of us, we're very alike. So why not take the next step? We can help each other.
I can't imagine how exciting it must be like to journey from place to place. You're so lucky!
I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my family is starting to suspect something.
I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my father is starting to suspect something.
I didn't think Maven or Mercer would allow me to get away with this, but I had little choice.
I don't have anything for you just yet. Please, talk to Nazir, and see what he has available.
I don't recall seeing you at one of these before. And I know everyone who's anyone in Skyrim.
I get my skooma from Sarthis Idren. He has some sort of a setup over at the Riften Warehouse.
I have a long way to go before I'm ready for the kind of advanced magic I've been attempting.
I haven't been touched like that since I visited a certain brothel in the city of Sentinel...
I haven't seen Savos since the explosion. He must've been blown clear, and he may be injured.
I just don't know that it's right for us to be in here like this, picking through the ruins .
I know how to mix a few basic potions, but I'm nowhere near as skilled as a master alchemist.
I mean look at this place. I've never seen so much wealth down here. You've made us all rich.
I might be old, but I haven't forgotten that a Jarl's first duty is to look after his people.
I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great import to Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun.
I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun. 
I oppose tyranny. I oppose those who tell me how to live, what to think, and what to believe.
I prayed to Mara and she spoke to me in a dream. She said a stranger would appear to help me.
I should bring some of these Dwemer artifacts to the Arcane University in Cyrodiil for study.
I suggest you learn more on your own. Come back once you've attained some measure of success.
I suppose Giraud sent you for it? I was still trying to get the wording right but here it is.
I thank you. Here, please accept this as a token of my appreciation for your selfless action.
I think the war is just an excuse. If it does end there will be a new reason and a new place.
I used to serve with Trilf and Steirod. Good guys, but don't get on their bad side, you know?
I was a sailor for many a year. I made my coin as a trader and in time, I bought my own ship.
I wish only to graduate and enroll with the Legion. My drums will lead our troops to victory.
I wonder if we should finally leave Markarth. These dragon attacks, I think Skyrim is cursed.
I would need to challenge the chief, and take his head, to return home. I'd rather stay here.
I'm glad they didn't find my lucky dagger. It's time to gut these rotten birds. Lead the way!
I'm not one to complain, but I'm not sure why Kraldar insists on keeping Malur Seloth around.
I'm sure that the owner of that place is relieved. They certainly came through with the coin.
I'm told they're the ravings of a madman... a wizard named Arondil and his peculiar cravings.
I'm worried about my daughter. I'm keeping an eye on her for a little while before I pass on.
If he could, Savos would float the the entire College above Skyrim, for all the Nords to see.
If he's right about Alduin... we both have just as much to lose here, Tullius, remember that.
If it's arms or armor you need, see Beirand in Castle Dour. Bloody good blacksmith, that one.
If the stones were remounted on the crown, it would be of great benefit to the Thieves Guild.
If you brought that Kel, that Elder Scroll back here... to the Tiid-Ahraan, the Time-Wound...
If you run across any enemy couriers, take them down, and bring me whatever they're carrying.
In the meantime, I'll make myself at home in the Sanctuary. I'm sure Mother needs... tending.
Ironic, right? The old enemies assume that every calamity must be a plot by the other side...
Is this what our people fought and died for? To forsake our most beloved ancestor and divine?
It appears that Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the Guild for months.
It has been proposed that the object is in fact the entirety of Aurbis in one physical space.
It was all just a fabrication of this Wyndelius character? I can't believe we were so stupid.
It was created by those who had lived under the unimaginable cruelty of Alduin's Dragon Cult.
It's clear you'll never see the Skeleton Key as I do... as an instrument of limitless wealth.
It's good to have another quick-eyed Shield-Sister in the hall. Come to me with any troubles.
It's one thing to say you've got the skills to be a thief. It's another to actually use them.
Just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine. Let me give you the details.
Kerah, do you have anything... exotic? Something no other woman in Markarth would be wearing.
Lacking the heart of a dead god, I am substituting the crystal you helped craft in its place.
Later, little one. I need to finish what I'm working on. But keep watching. Watch, and learn.
Look, the only religion I believe in is the good old septim. Everything else is just a waste.
Lot of history in these walls. We're trying to make some more. It's a lucky time to be alive.
Malacath himself said this to you? But what does it... Ah! Yes! I see! A ritual is necessary!
Mighty Arkay, I pray that you will shepherd these souls as they pass into the realm of death.
My sister keeps telling me that the farm keeps us alive, but I don't really call this living.
No doubt he thought it was the only way to make his point. And also because he knew he could.
No, I found her horse. Don't worry, I've taken care of it... she won't be using it to escape.
No, it was Svidi's brother, Wulfur. She's in hiding now. Somewhere far from here I'd suspect.
No, no. Mostly, I'm just a simple herbalist. Lami over in Morthal should be able to help you.
No. I can't risk weakening the city while we are under the threat of enemy attack. I'm sorry.
Not that I actually want to see one, understand. I hope that dragon stays far away from here.
Now go forth, child. Continue your tiny subversions against the orders of trust and intimacy.
Now look what you've gotten yourself into. No worries. Just sit tight. I'll find the release.
Of course working for Bolfrida isn't my first choice. But what else can a Dunmer do out here?
Oh really? And I don't suppose you'd just do it out of the kindness of your heart, would you?
Oh, my! You? It is an honor! Your food has opened my eyes to the wonders this world can hold.
Oh, this was thousands of years ago, before the Akaviri crusaders cleansed Skyrim of dragons.
One day, I intend to be chief. I will fight my father and my brother for it, as is tradition.
Outlaws and brigands are the lowest of the low. They prey on their own countrymen for profit.
Pactur and I, we make sure the miners aren't stealing, and that the ore makes it to Solitude.
Perhaps that is what you are meant to believe. To better serve your role as Azura's champion.
Pickings may be a bit slim today, but if you see anything you like I'll make you a good deal.
Plunder these ruins at your peril, friend. The spirits of the dead won't look kindly upon it.
Raerek is far too cautious, but I'll agree with him on any measure that keeps this city safe.
Several of his ancestors belonged to the Mythic Dawn, the cult that almost destroyed Tamriel.
She only lets us out in the yard once. In the morning. And she just stands there watching us.
She's an absolute pleasure to work for! In fact, I almost feel guilty accepting pay from her.
Since you went so far as seek out the Augur for advice, I thought you'd be more enthusiastic.
Sir, I will shape them up but with the war on it is unwise to reduce their wages any further.
Smithing isn't the most exciting thing for me, but we all have to lend a hand as best we can.
Speak with Urag in the Arcanaeum. See if he is aware of anything that matches your discovery.
Take a look at my supplies if you must, but do hurry... I'm not getting any younger you know!
Tell you what. Keep to your word, and I'll line your pockets with as much as I can scrape up.
Thank you for telling me. This is a day where our souls must cry, and our hearts will answer.
Thank you. I'll be sure to get Elgrim to examine this as soon as his... busy schedule allows.
Thanks again for saving my life. I think I'm done with venturing outside of Markarth, though.
That's right. An Orc stronghold. Kept to ourselves. Lived as our ancestors would have wanted.
The assumption that the Nightingales were just a myth was seeded within the Guild on purpose.
The city hasn't changed that much, dear. Same old dwarven stones gathering the same old moss.
The Elder Scroll gives insight deeper than the deep ones, though. To bring about the opening.
The Empire and the Jarls who back them must be swept away. The people demand it. I demand it.
The Eye of Magnus. Here, but lost. Slipped through our grasp. Oh, what we might have learned.
The guardian spirits of Bear, Mammoth and Sabre Cat await you. Return when they are defeated.
The Imperial agent? That's right. I knew. How many dogs is the Empire going to send after me?
The last person that made trouble for Vekel ended up floating in the canal... catch my drift?
The only thing better than a powerful mage fighting at your side is... well, nothing, really.
The resulting disaster would reflect quite poorly on everyone involved. Are you following me?
The short answer is: we fight. The long answer is... eh, forget it. You're not worth my time.
The sons of Skyrim will live up to their agreements. As long as the Imperials hold to theirs.
The stories don't say why the dwarves disappeared. I wonder if their machines turned on them.
Then I say well met, friend. I could tell you were a sharp one the moment I laid eyes on you.
Then it appears the shadows shroud more than your presence... they blind your wisdom as well.
There's a rift here in Skyrim, and can't neither magic nor the passin' of time make it right.
There's a whole college up in Solitude where they teach the arts. Song. Lute-playing. Poetry.
They don't make finer steel anywhere else. If this doesn't keep you from dying, nothing will.
They live in seclusion near the top of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim.
They say this marriage is the first step towards peace. Who in Shor's name wants peace? Pfft.
They wanted a confession. To what didn't matter, they simply wanted me to admit to something.
They're able to grind it down so fine that it can be infused into the lattice of packed snow.
This is the resting place of Ysgramor. And his most trusted generals. You should be cautious.
This skill should prove very useful, Dragonborn. Fighting fire with fire, as the saying goes.
Those falls... dangerous place. Derkeethus thought he could find some good fish in the pools.
To hear Farkas tell it, our father raised us here as happy pups, running around biting knees.
To suddenly have all that wrenched away is like losing someone you hold dearly in your heart.
Try to find out where their fortress is. The captain, Stig Salt-Plank, has to know something.
Turns out you're a screw up like the rest. But I still need you. So I'll overlook it for now.
Ulfric's a bloody hero. I don't think there's a worthy Nord alive who'd dare argue the point.
Very well. It's not something often discussed, as it might be... misunderstood by the locals.
Wanderer like you must have plenty of tales to tell. But I'm afraid I'm too busy to hear 'em.
We will oust Ulfric from Windhelm soon enough. And when we do, I'll have his head on a plate.
Well, my friend... the time's come to make it official. It's time to become our Guild Master.
Well, there were eight of them and she'd already killed three by the time I joined the fight.
What do you think the Imperials would be doing while this dragon is busy slaughtering my men?
What do you think? I can't let Ulfric dictate terms to me before the negotiations even start.
What I meant to say was... I love having an Orc here in the barracks. They're so... pleasant.
What you have already learned in a few days took even the most gifted of us years to achieve.
What? That little tease! Leading me on and turning cold at the last minute. I don't think so.
Where do you think you'll be the most help - scouting ahead or supporting the rest of my men?
Why did you... nevermind, it's a sign. I'll return to temple. Here's something for your help.
Why do your people claim the Reach is theirs? The Orcs have been in these lands just as long.
Why would anyone join the Stormcloaks? They have a fraction of the Empire's wealth and power.
Will she swear fealty to me, so all may know that we are at peace, and a new day has dawned? 
Yamarz charged me with keeping outsiders away from Largashbur. You would have me disobey him?
Yes... quite. But if that power could be harnessed. Controlled. The possibilities would be...
You an assassin or a thief? Next time, keep your blade sheathed if you want to make any gold.
You don't worry about two Orc men coming into your stronghold? That they might challenge you?
You have vanquished a great evil from Skyrim. You have saved this land... and our very souls.
You haven't heard of the Silver-Blood family? They're the most important people in the Reach.
You hear the news? Those damn mages blew up Winterhold! Guess it was just a matter of time...
You look like someone who can hold their liquor. How about a friendly contest to win a staff?
You make an interesting offer. Very well, I'm sure that I can put the extra coin to good use.
You may be right. Camilla may see Faendal as little more than a friend, but why take chances?
You mean, after all that's transpired, the Dark Brotherhood will still... honor the contract?
You tempt me mightily, Alva. But I won't cuckhold another man, even on murderer like Hroggar.
You want me to let a dragon into the heart of my city, with the threat of war on my doorstep?
You'll find Ri'saad with his caravan group. Just don't do anything stupid when you get there.
You'll meet a lot of tongue-wagging gossips in this town. Try not to take them too seriously.
You'll need to use spells to do that. Being from the College, I assume you know them already.
You've been in Riften for quite some time now, Lady Mjoll. I fear that you soon may leave us.
'Tis a wicked axe you wield there, friend. That blade looks sharp enough to cut through a god.
[QUOTE]Olaf sent word to Solitude's Jarl, cajoling and mocking and begging for a fight.[QUOTE]
A big dead tree isn't very inspiring if you're coming to worship the divine of wind and rains.
A Priest of Arkay is entrusted with a ceremonial dagger once they've completed their training.
A warrior marches on the gut. Here. This should give you strength. I'll cook another tomorrow.
Ah, splendid, splendid. It's for a special brew I'm working on. A love elixir like none other.
An apple to keep you healthy? A tomato to keep you strong? Surely you need one or the other...
And everything is made of stone. Even the beds. We'll have no trouble from dragon's fire here.
And if the rebels have themselves a dragon, General Tullius is the only one who can stop them.
And you're sure Helgen was destroyed by a dragon? This wasn't some Stormcloak raid gone wrong?
Are you kidding me? Vex lost them in seconds... once she steps into the shadows, she vanishes.
Aren't they? I always set some aside for myself when the traders bring them up from the south.
Arnleif and Sons Trading Company. I'm a porter. Just some muscle hired to move heavy packages.
As long as they can swing a pickaxe where I tell them, they're as smart as we need them to be.
At least, I don't think so. No, it's just... It's just something I'd prefer to keep to myself.
At this time, there is no indication that either group is aware of the other's correspondence.
Be sure and introduce yourself to your new Family members. They're all very eager to meet you.
Biding his time until what? Until another person is lying dead in the streets? Don't be naive.
Brynjolf pulled me in a few years ago. Said the Guild was lacking some muscle, so I joined up.
Brynjolf tells me you'll make an excellent Guild Master. Oh, he's looking for you, by the way.
Bunch of foreign troublemakers. Wandering around, getting into mischief, scaring the citizens.
But I haven't forgotten the service you did for me in retrieving the Dragonstone for Farengar.
But I never knew if nights-end brought victory - a swift-flying arrow to Sovngarde carried me.
By Ysmir's beard, I ain't one for humor. You know who the Companions are. So quit your asking.
Can't wait to see the look on their faces when they find us here waiting to spill their blood.
Capable as he may be, I don't see any signs of him being this, what, [QUOTE]Dragonborn.[QUOTE]
Captain Volf is ashore right now and I want the authorities waiting for him when he gets back.
Did you find the Elder Scroll? What happened when you took it back to the Throat of the World?
Didn't have a coin to spend between our entire family. Ate the same slop we fed our livestock.
Do not dishonor or attempt to harm Elisif in any way. Adhere to that rule, and you'll be fine.
Does she exact payment when we die? When we suffer does she revel in our misery? No one knows.
Don't expect the local Nords to take kindly to you once they find out you're from the College.
Don't get me wrong. The first few years with that clan were some of the best years of my life.
Don't go to the Blue Palace. The master is on vacation. Don't listen to Dervenin. Don't do it.
Don't have to tell me twice. But then, I'm not the one that buried iron under these mountains.
Don't think I can take you? One hundred septims says I can punch you back where you came from.
Don't worry. I'm sure he made it out. It'll take more than a dragon to stop Ulfric Stormcloak.
Dragons, is it? Does that make you the fabled [QUOTE]Dragonborn[QUOTE] we've heard mention of?
Drink up, my boy! Drink to those who have fallen! May their souls find their way to Sovngarde!
Eirid's a little girl who doesn't understand that they're responsible for destroying our home.
Fine. The hilt is in a chest inside my house.  Here are the keys. Take that damn thing and go.
Glad my father seems to have found someone. I just hope she can hold her own against my aunts.
Going back would be the end of all of us. We keep pushing forward, and we'll make it. We will!
Good. I'm glad you're making progress. My employers are anxious to have some tangible answers.
He usually knows what's going in and out of that place. Thankfully that means I don't have to.
He wanted to meet Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken from him.
He was always a quiet lad, but lately... something has changed. He's become brooding. Violent.
He's barred the door. Gods only know how he's... defiling the bodies of my ancestors in there!
Here, see for yourself. This is the last word I received. I'm telling you, he's gone for good.
Here. Take a look for yourself. But give it back soon. It's almost time for milady's medicine.
Hmm. So I haven't. All right, I'll buy the ingredients tomorrow and we can have it for dinner.
Hmmm... horker. So delicious. I swear, is there a soul alive who doesn't enjoy the taste of...
Hmph. Don't say much, but there's a strange aura about you. You walk in the shadow of death...
How can Mercer open up a vault that needs two keys? It's impossible. Could he pick his way in?
However, if we lose the war, the guardsmen of Solitude will make little difference in the end.
I ain't afraid of the old hag. Still, I wish Constance was in charge. She treats us real good.
I believe I've heard it said that it's the only thing that could adequately contain his power.
I can fashion whatever kind of weapon you want. Finest forge in Skyrim, right here before you.
I certainly don't expect it to have quite the same results. I'm no tonal architect, of course!
I don't believe it. I made that bow myself. Been through some messes with it, let me tell you.
I don't dare show my face, lest they recognize me, so you'll have to find out where they are. 
I don't have time for this foolishness. Now come along quietly and we won't have to get rough.
I don't know if they were right to execute him for what he did, but I'll tell you something...
I don't think Rikke even knows my name. Probably because I'm not [QUOTE]The Dragonborn.[QUOTE]
I don't trust them. Come to think of it, I don't trust you either, but at least you're family.
I expected better of you, Dragonborn. You swore an oath to serve the Emperor. Don't forget it.
I had hoped your scholars would be on a level comparable with my own colleagues. They are not.
I have never been without Azura's foresight since escaping Morrowind. I don't know what to do.
I know why you're here. I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is.
I know you have a damn good reason for siding with Karliah, so I hope you can give it to them.
I meditate on the Rotmulaag - the Words of Power. I counsel in their use. It is enough for me.
I own the Pelagia Farm, just outside the city walls. Nimriel takes good care of things for me.
I paid extra for the biggest room in the Silver-Blood Inn. I need space to stretch these arms.
I really just needed something to encourage you to go out into the world and spread merriment.
I served in the Great War against the Thalmor. I remember how bravely a Legionnaire can fight.
I swear, you people are an odd bunch. Please, just step aside, that I may return to my duties!
I traveled the length and breadth of this land, learning all I could of the sword and the axe.
I was hoping to head into Riften for supplies, but I can do that after I'm done with the elms.
I was one of the best soldiers in the Stormcloak army, until I took a sword through the chest.
I will meet with Molag Bal, and I will venerate his altar in Boethiah's name, as I did before.
I won't complain about Korir being gone, but I don't expect things to really be any different.
I'd like to know why there's someone claiming to be from the Psijic Order here in the College.
I'll carry on his tradition as best I can. I could spend a lifetime just going over his notes.
I'm afraid that concludes our business. You have exhausted all available additional contracts.
I'm not saying it's my business, but I have to ask. Why are you so cruel to your little girls?
I'm sorry to hear that. If you change your mind, speak with Galmar. What does bring you to me?
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression earlier. I meant no disrespect.
I'm sure you've already noticed the markings. They're quite unlike anything we've seen before.
I'm the heavy hitter around here. When someone needs pushing around, I'm the one they send in.
I've been chronicling the recent history of the Blades. What would you like your entry to say?
I've got a recipe for venison stew that I want to try out. Will you have venison anytime soon?
I've just been asked enough questions. I'm here to learn, not to explain myself over and over.
I've made a lot of new contacts thanks to you, and more contacts means more coin for everyone.
If Alduin is eternal, then eternity's done. For his story is over and the dragons are... gone.
If I make enough money from the farm, I'll buy myself a longship to sail the rivers of Skyrim.
If I'm a traitor, so are you! Have you not heard the maiden's voice? Are you not the Listener?
If only we could get our hands on that treasure. We could get out of here and never look back.
If so, the bride will probably address the crowd from the balcony. It overlooks the courtyard.
If you can't pound the dusk out of your iron, it'll break when it's finished. Hit. It. Harder.
If you could convince him that I don't care about his tab, it'd certainly make me feel better.
If you'd allow me to indulge myself for a moment, I thought I might make a few observations...
If you're going after those thieves, you should head to Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town.
If you're in the market for the finest bows money can buy, you're talking to the right person.
If you're looking to purchase goods, I have none to sell. You should head into Riften instead.
Imperials, Stormcloaks... I don't care who's in charge around here. I just want to make money!
In fact, Vex barely made it out of there alive. You should talk to her about it before you go.
Is it that obvious? I should take pains to seem more happy. I wouldn't want to upset our host.
Is that a threat? Back off, or by the Eight I'll cleave that arrogant head from its shoulders.
It does. The College has caused enough problems; don't need you or anyone else adding to them.
It further suggests that we are somehow then outside our own existence while looking in at it.
It seems that predators have taken up residence and have been attacking farmers and travelers.
It takes a brave soul to wander onto my deck. It'll take more than that to leave in one piece.
It was Atmah's idea to come here, at first. She talked me into it, and I convinced the others.
It was the blade hefted by Ysgramor when he returned to drive the elves out of the old Skyrim.
It was the Kel - the Elder Scroll. They used it to... cast him adrift on the currents of Time.
It's an honor to have Viarmo for instruction on drum, but he's far too reserved for my tastes.
It's been a brutal winter. I can't remember the last time it was this cold, and for this long.
It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I wouldn't have made it without your help today.
It's unnatural, building all these machines. If you ask me, the Dwemer got what they deserved.
J'zargo understands. You hesitate because you know J'zargo will be better than you. Very well.
Jarls come and jarls go, but a good cook stays for a lifetime. And I'm a very, very good cook.
Just do whatever the contact wishes. Be professional, represent us well, and get the job done.
Just like old times, huh Horik? You and me fighting in a war over some forsaken scrap of land.
Just look at this place. I've seen better workmanship from Nord children only ten winters old.
Karliah always was a nimble minx... slipping passed these draugr must be child's play for her.
Killing the Gourmet will leave an emptiness in the collective soul of Skyrim. This pleases me.
Last thing the Black-Briars need is some stranger stickin' their nose where it doesn't belong.
Let me know the minute you find something. I've got to see to Veezara, and calm everyone down.
Let's hope the miners didn't unearth anything besides precious stones, if you take my meaning.
Listen, I'm going to lay up here for a while. You can make your own way to Solitude from here.
Look, I'm getting out of here. Normally, spiders make my skin crawl, but magic spiders? Blech.
Lord of Seasons, I pray to you now that you might watch over the dead with mercy and kindness.
Madanach! Think you can escape my prison do you? You'll pay for what you've done to my family!
Mine is not a popular position, but someone needs to keep things running smoothly around here.
Most of the establishments in Skyrim keep their transactions recorded within business ledgers.
My choice, hmm? All right, then - tomatoes. Simple, yet infinitely flavorful. Don't you agree?
My disciples still follow the difficult path - the Way of the Voice is neither wide, nor easy.
My Saffir doesn't like that I've been spending so much time looking for my father's old sword.
Near Giants' Gap, in the gloom before dawn, we marched, unsuspecting into the Imperials' trap.
No killing. I'm not hiring the Dark Brotherhood, here. If you get caught, it's not my problem.
No, we Daedra are far more powerful than any god. And among my brethren, I am the most feared.
No. I was just buying jewelry for my sister in Cyrodiil. I've never even seen that man before.
No. I was just getting some fresh air. Had one too many pints of mead at the Silver-Blood Inn.
Not at all. I tend not to ask too many questions when I'm on the job. I'm sure you understand.
Not much more to tell. This dragon flew over and just wrecked the whole place. Mass confusion.
Not to worry, dear Svana. I promise you I can handle it, but your concern is quite flattering.
Now he's in the Emperor's pocket like the rest of 'em, with no regard for honor an' tradition.
Oh yes, many times. But mighty Talos was my keeper, my shield against the heresy of the south!
Oh yes. I know everyone who sleeps in the Warrens. Kind of the one who passes the keys around.
Oh, Faida. I may travel alone, but you know I carry you always in my heart. I'll see you soon.
Oh, for the salt spray, the creek of the mast, and the clash of sabers. Those were the days...
Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend. Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?
Oh, I get it. This is a test, right? You want to see how well I know the Potage le Magnifique.
Oh, I shouldn't be surprised if they come 'round. And if you're never seen or heard from agin.
Oh, no. I hadn't heard from Gorm for a while, so I'd hoped he'd given up on his little scheme.
Oh, thank you! I've been working on an original piece. I hope it can stand up to the classics!
Oh! You're a traveler! You must have so much to tell about the world outside this boring town!
Oh... Oh how marvelous. Just delicious. It is everything I had hoped it would be. It.... I....
Oh... yes... um... thank you. Here you go. Some gold for your assistance and your, discretion.
Okay, look. If I'm caught saying anything bad about the meadery or the family, I'm a dead man.
Old fort. Abandoned for years. They're like jackals, making their home anywhere they can find.
Once the sun goes down, it's just me and the dogs. They keep me warm, and don't talk too much.
One day I hope to become a painter, but at this rate it looks like it's never going to happen.
Others returned home after the Red Year, when Vvardenfell erupted and caused much destruction.
Our chief is weakened. He will not rest, will not sleep. He suffers, and so the tribe suffers.
Perhaps... Perhaps it might. If nothing else, you could be an excellent sacrifice to Malacath.
Priests of Arkay such as myself perform rites for the dead and sometimes console the bereaved.
Really? Oh, I use Nirnroot as a special seasoning all the time as well. What a wonderful idea.
Reldith is the hardest-working farmer in Rorikstead, but I'm the one with a head for business.
Search out enemy soldiers in the wilderness, or guarding towns and settlements, and kill them.
She flashed a bag of gold in my face and said all I had to do was pay Aringoth for the estate.
She is likely not using her true name. We will pay for any information regarding her location.
She's trying to undermine my confidence, make me doubt myself. Well it won't work, I tell you!
Since you're so well informed I'm certain you've solved the problem with thermic drift, right?
Skyrim is the birth place of the Empire. We won't let a bunch of thugs rob her of her lineage.
So, they're making you Guild Master, eh? Good. Just find Brynjolf and he can make it official.
Some day soon, you will all see battle. And what you do here, today, may well save your lives!
Some folk who make the trip leave them food or other essentials, but not to make conversation.
Still shaken from all the fighting, my friend. It's been too long since I had to kill someone.
Thank you. I can't stand the thought of being trapped in this village for the rest of my days.
That's about the truth of it. Write tales about the sights I've seen. The battles I've fought.
That's when the fun starts. You'll have to slip away from the party without raising the alarm.
The cornerclub's been filling up at night lately. I'll bet Elda up at Candlehearth is jealous.
The dwarves were very clever, tapping into and drawing power from the Heart of Lorkhan itself.
The Empire will withdraw its troops from Winterhold, allowing Jarl Korir to return from exile.
The Eye of Talos was a fine ship, once. Now it lies wrecked, off an island just north of here.
The Guild will not tolerate the kind of behavior you've been displaying. Too much is at stake.
The Jarl is not to be disturbed with common affairs of court. You direct those concerns to me.
The nightmares in Dawnstar have lifted, and I hear you helped that happen. You have my thanks.
The only reason you have the gold for your [QUOTE]business[QUOTE] is because I gave it to you.
The only thing keeping me from having you killed is Brynjolf. He's stepped in and made amends.
The other noble houses discovered her betrayal and she fled. They want her brought back alive.
The Rift is seeing a lot of trouble from some riff-raff. We need to head in and break them up.
The Silver Hand have taken over the old fort at Gallows Rock. They always make such easy prey.
The Skyforge? Aye, my clan-fathers have worked it since the first Gray-Manes came to Whiterun.
The Stormcloaks will withdraw from Hjaalmarch, and Idgrod Ravencrone will resume the Jarlship.
The temple offers her blessings to pilgrims and instruction in enjoying all life has to offer.
The warehouse is for East Empire Company workers only. Entering without permission is a crime.
Then by Talos, you do what you feel you're meant to do. I'll take care of your father for you.
Then go back to your boss and tell him what I've already told him so many times, I lose count.
There are pockets brimming with coin and coffers overflowing with riches ripe for the picking.
There's a lot of pressure for me to excel in my studies. I hope I can live up to expectations.
There's the one about Tiber Septim and the dragon Nafaalilargus. I never bothered to learn it.
These terms are satisfactory to my government. The truce is unlikely to last long in any case.
They grabbed me in the Ratway. The nerve of these bastards... they need to be taught a lesson.
They live in seclusion on the slopes of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim.
They say ruins like these are filled with treasure. Of course, they're filled with traps, too.
They usually make runs along the coast shipping all sorts of contraband to and from Morrowind.
They're vermin... garbage. They're exactly what makes this city such a horrible place to live.
This is where they built Alduin's Wall, to set down in stone all their accumulated dragonlore.
To reach the heights of the Companions, you must join with us in the shared blood of the wolf.
True, he's a dangerous and blood thirsty man, but he's also a Nord that honors our traditions.
Try to hide it all you want. I know you're in the Thieves Guild... and so do the other guards.
Uh... yeah. I know you don't mind hurting people. Just look what you did to... well, you know.
Vex just tells me to run, so I did. Half of them went after me, the other half went after her.
We have nothing to say to each other. Paarthurnax's murder is beyond my powers of forgiveness.
We scuffled for a while, broke each other's weapons, and finally fell to the ground exhausted.
We should be careful. There's no telling what traps and wards the ancient Blades may have set.
We should tread carefully. I wouldn't be surprised if he's left behind a few surprises for us.
Welcome, sister! I'm glad that your eyes have finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.
Well, I did hear that the Argonians have been banned from living inside the walls of Windhelm.
Well, sir, the hold of Falkreath is fairly vulnerable, and blocks the only road from Cyrodiil.
Were the Greybeards any help? Did they know this anything about the Shout used against Alduin?
What I want is irrelevant. This Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again.
What's the matter, soldier? I gave you an order. I want that fort, and I want it now. Move it!
When I became Steward, I had to give up the bottle. The people of the hold need me at my best.
When I started out in this business, I wasn't really interested in the Guild or being a thief.
When people talk about the decadent, tottering Empire, it's people like you they have in mind!
Why not? Business has been terrible. Most folk would rather hunt their own meat than buy ours.
Why settle for just stabbing your foes when you can roast them alive in a gout of arcane fire?
Why? Because I'd rather be here trying to keep my only brother from drinking himself to death.
Windhelm has been hard on my people. But our fortunes will turn, and we have shelter and food.
Woah, ease up there. We're rough, but there's no need to kill a Shield-Brother over a dispute.
Yatul's been teaching me to hunt. I'm still learning, but she's the best teacher I could have.
Yeah, but raising Draugr to take on both the Imperials and the Stormcloaks? That's just crazy.
Yeah, sure. Got a business on tap that could use a little number rearrangin'. What do you say?
Yes, my friend. Though no one has been able to get close to her for as long as I can remember.
Yes, well. After the unfortunate incident that occurred, I think it's best if we just move on.
You always were a fool, Ulfric. You're no better at diplomacy than you are on the battlefield.
You do not understand. Alduin cannot be slain like a lesser dragon. He is beyond our strength.
You keep giving and giving Bersi, and they'll keep taking and taking. When is it going to end?
You know what? I want you to keep it. My great hunts are behind me, but yours are yet to come.
You know, I'm almost beginning to like you, but you haven't earned your place out of here yet.
You surrender Falkreath to us. Siddgeir steps down, and Dengeir of Stuhn resumes the Jarlship.
You want to know more? Ask Calcelmo. He's usually in front of the ruins, just down the tunnel.
You will find him holed up at Knifepoint Ridge, where he plays king to bandits and highwaymen.
You're alive. I owe Ulfric a drink. I have to admit, I didn't think we'd be seeing you again. 
You've been seen in the company of the Companions. That's an honorable path you're on, friend.
You've disgraced yourself and our cause. You are no longer fit to be known as a son of Skyrim.
Your daughters are growing up fast, Lemkil. Seems like only yesterday they were newborn babes.
Your job is to get into the party without being fingered as a spy. I'll take care of the rest.
Your main job will be to keep an eye out and get the people to safety if the town is attacked.
[QUOTE]Every door has a key,[QUOTE] says Vilkas. Sometimes he is wrong, but look around anyway.
[QUOTE]From Winterhold Olaf had sent every message, upon attack he was nowhere in sight.[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]No shouting match between dragon and man, no fire or fury did this battle entail.[QUOTE]
A parent should never outlive a child. Having my son's spirit here... it's as if he never died.
A piece of my power has been locked away behind it, and even my eyes cannot see past the seals.
About the same as everyone else. They're the cat-folk of Elsweyr. Great warriors, good traders.
After we're done here, head over to Tonilia and she'll set you up with your Guild Master Armor.
Ah, the immortal plane. It is said to be the source of all magic. This is a noble goal, indeed.
Ah, yes... seems he sent back my satchel stuffed with letters. I look forward  to reading them.
Ah, you see? That wasn't so hard, now was it? Let's the two of us just forget we ever met, hmm?
Ah, you're just in time. I got in a shipment of fine wares courtesy of the East Empire Company.
Ahhh... You're quite brave to carry such a message. It's a pity you've chosen the wrong side...
All right, you delivered on your end, so I'll deliver on mine. Here's the gem Arniel was after.
And don't think I've forgotten that you were the one that gave it to Ulfric in the first place.
And why would you be looking for me, hmm? I'm not sure I appreciate your presence here. Friend.
Another day, another settlement gets attacked. No place in the Reach is safe from the Forsworn.
Any resident of Solitude can tell you, she was the deadliest person ever to come out of Skyrim.
Are you all enjoying yourselves? Please, eat, drink, and make merry on this most happy of days.
Are you kidding me? Ever since the Guild's luck turned sour, we haven't had a coin to our name.
As the one who bore the fragments, I think you should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into battle.
As time passed, a thriving community sprang up around Jorrvaskr, as was common with mead halls.
At the end of the day you'll find all we care about down here is how much gold you can make us.
At the end of the day, I'm the last line of defense for the Jarl. I will not allow her to fall.
Be warned. Many have thought as you do. I have broken them all. You shall not evade me forever.
Because they've got Thorald locked away somewhere, and if they find me here I'll disappear too!
Because you wanted to learn the longer blades. Aela's never used anything bigger than a dagger.
Big lizards? By Shor, your mother gave birth to a half-wit. That is the end of this discussion.
But a single candle can banish the darkness of the entire Void. If not you, then someone else. 
But do not make the mistake of underestimating the Legion. Plenty of them are Nords same as us.
But do you know what intrigues me the most? The fact that this was all possible because of you.
But he thinks everything used to be better. I, for one, would trust any Companion with my life.
But I do respect power, and the Thalmor have that. They leave me alone, and I leave them alone.
But more than that, it was you who fought for Skyrim, for our right to fight our own battles...
But there's a Khajiit hanging around the main gate. I didn't like the way he was looking at me.
But with four Voices joined, our valor combined, we can blast the mist and bring him to battle.
By blade or by spell, if you want it dead, I'll make it dead. All you need to do is pay my fee.
By Ysmir, you've helped save the Gildergreen. Words can't express what that means to this city.
Capable as she may be, I don't see any signs of her being this, what, [QUOTE]Dragonborn.[QUOTE]
Come see me in Solitude when this is all done. The Emperor can always use another good soldier.
Desperate times call for desperate measures. Maybe she found what she was looking for in there.
Do you think muscling me is going to work? I'm a wizard. An old. Elven. Wizard. Think about it.
Does it look like I can afford losing a day's wage? That damn Orc isn't getting the best of me.
Don't worry, I'll get Esbern there in one piece. We'll wait for you near Karthspire. Good luck.
Don't you worry Rhiada. If any Forsworn coming knocking on our door, Nana will let you know....
Dragons are coming back, and you're a born dragonslayer. That's all you need to know right now.
Dragons, pah. They can be killed. The Blades killed many in their early days as dragon-slayers.
Drop it off and he'll trade you something for the delivery. Keep it as payment for the legwork.
Either way, the Reach is wild country these days. The Forsworn are everywhere. Best be careful.
Endon's mold? I'm afraid you have the wrong place, my friend. You'll find no silversmiths here.
Every day is a struggle, but a Nord doesn't back down from a fight when the cause is honorable.
Every year, I sell more Honningbrew and Maven loses customers. Know why? My mead tastes better.
Fair enough. You claim to be neutral, but it seems that you actually favor the Empire. Still...
Father says I don't have the knack for reading, but mama says I won't need it to work the farm.
Few would dare to trespass in these ruins. What you lack in wisdom, you make up for in courage.
Fine. Then I'll invite him out to play. He lives right there. I'm going to knock on his door...
Fine. You sound like a priest of Mara, but I get your point. Tell him to forget about the gold.
First, we're going to take out their sentry, then we'll situate ourselves overlooking the camp.
For one thing, I won't empty Falkreath's coffers to buy myself fine clothes an' expensive mead.
Given the history of this place, it's more than likely there's still some amount of power here.
Go and slay one of the beasts. It should let them know that Dawnstar is not to be trifled with.
Got word from Torsten Cruel-Sea in Windhelm that a rival Guild is tryin' to get itself started.
Hard to say. It's ancient, that much we know for sure. It was here long before the town itself.
Have you seen Astrid? She needs to speak with you. It seemed urgent. Come talk to me afterward.
He explained it all to me. Before, when I still understood. I don't remember, but I still know.
He needs someone to confide in. If it will not be one of us, perhaps it will be you. Go to him.
He now serves us honorably as Thane, and to the great benefit of the hold, I now serve as Jarl.
He's afraid of being taken as well, so he hasn't left the house. All he talks about is Thorald.
Here, just like I promised. This should fetch you a nice price. And thank you. Thank you again.
Here. I want you to accept this as payment for your sacrifice and I... well, we both thank you.
Hey, maybe the reason these gray-skins don't help in the war is because they're Imperial spies!
Hjerim? Well, I'm not sure what you think you'll find there, but you're welcome to have a look.
Hold, Alduin on the Wing! Sister Hawk, grant us your sacred breath to make this contract heard!
How long will it be sung? My feet were set upon the rock but it turned to mud and drew me down.
Hroggar doesn't have to know if we sit together. Or drink together. I doubt he would even care.
Hurry up with it, we've got a merchant in the pit to take care of after we carve this thing up.
I can take care of myself. A Whiterun woman learns how to handle a few idiot men early in life.
I could smelt metal in half the time as you weak-willed pink-skins. Do I have to do everything?
I don't care what it costs. I need four longbows and four score of arrows. Just make it happen.
I don't know how, but he lives. I get his messages, and I hand out his orders without question.
I don't think Galmar even knows my name. Probably because I'm not [QUOTE]The Dragonborn.[QUOTE]
I fear keeping the Phial would just remind me of Nurelion's obsession, and how it consumed him.
I find that highly unlikely... I think it would be irresponsible to write that in to the verse.
I got one last special request of you. Finish this one and all of Skyrim's ours for the takin'.
I guess I should get back to my brother. He'll throw a fit if I take too long. Such a child....
I handle the burglary, shill, sweep and heist jobs. Most of them involve breaking and entering.
I have a business proposition for any sailors who might be looking to make a few extra septims.
I have some thoughts. There are three crucial elements. Some may be easier to find than others.
I have to admit, I admire your courage. Most folk in Skyrim wouldn't go near a place like this.
I hear your heart beat like the Harbingers of old. Your glories in Skyrim are seen and honored.
I heard the Gourmet is hiding out somewhere in Skyrim. You know, fella who wrote that cookbook.
I made a lot of friends in a lot of ports, and the Thalmor approached me with a generous offer.
I need someone that cares about me more than they care about themselves. That person isn't you.
I never did understand the local custom of simply leaving one's trash wherever is convenient...
I once saw Steirod tear a whole tree out the ground with his bare hands. Glad he's on our side!
I only hope we can restore the Guild to its former glory after all the damage that's been done.
I saw you working the forge today, wife. Your muscles have grown strong from the metal shaping!
I see. Then there's nothing further to discuss. If you change your mind, speak with the Legate.
I see... it looks like Suvaris has been traveling to Dawnstar to meet with a pirate crew there.
I seem to have more chores for the Winking Skeever each day. I still have a delivery to do too.
I think if Brynjolf catches wind of it, he'll boot you right out of here... so drop it already!
I think we could blow up half of Eastmarch, and people would still come to us for enchantments.
I thought we'd talked enough. Unless you've reconsidered my offer? That Cicero needs sortin'...
I want to make things clear. Markarth has its troubles, but there are no Forsworn in this city.
I will do nothing of the sort. You have no business here. I'm sorry, but you really must leave.
I will have someone take care of the cave as well Varnius, you can rest easy. You're dismissed.
I would like to officially extend to you an invitation to join my Family. The Dark Brotherhood.
I'll add this to the rest of the items. I don't think there's anything further I need from you.
I'll admit, I'm having trouble coming to terms with all of this. I'll just follow Nazir's lead.
I'll be glad to help you. There are many ways to improve your home, provided you have the coin.
I'll give you a brief tour, and then we'll get you to your first class. Are you ready to begin?
I'll need a whole crate of fruit. That Varnius Junius went through quite a few of our supplies.
I'm fortunate that Kust and the people of Falkreath have come to accept me as one of their own.
I'm going to make this short and sweet, because frankly I don't think you deserve another shot.
I'm not as skilled as Curalmil, so I'm afraid it will only ever refill with one type of liquid.
I'm not just talking about my subjects. I'm talking about my people: the proud Nords of Skyrim.
I'm not Madanach. I was never a leader of the Forsworn. The only anger I can justify is my own.
I'm so glad you got back from Olaf's Tomb okay. They gave you a tougher task then they gave me.
I'm sure you can figure it out on your own. If you can't, perhaps Urag has a book you can read.
I've never seen anything like this in Nordic ruins before. Why, just look at all these coffins!
I've read the entrails many times, but can't fathom why Mauhulakh's wives keep finding tragedy.
If he does, he isn't telling me a thing. I've asked, but all I get from him are more questions.
If I have to hold your hand through everything, maybe you aren't cut out for this kind of work.
If I were you, I'd pack up and get out of here before you end up in one of those burial cairns.
If the guards in the Gray Quarter weren't a bunch of n'wahs, I wouldn't be here talking to you.
If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell.
If you like I'd be happy to take it over the operation for you. Take the source off your hands.
If you want to know, ask Nelacar. He's staying at the Frozen Hearth. Knows the whole sad story.
If you're looking for Ranmir, he's either passed out in bed, or working on winding up that way.
If you're looking for truth instead, see Noster. He's a good example of what life has to offer.
If you're not here for the College, then you've little other reason to be in Winterhold at all.
If you're off to fight, talk to Beirand before you go. His armor is well forged and dependable.
If you've got an axe, you can always make gold chopping wood. Just bring me everything you cut.
In a world of fools, you stand out above the rest. Here, take this small sign of my friendship.
Ingun, how much longer do you intend to waste your life concocting your foolish little potions?
Is that so, Erikur? And you with such delicate sensibilities. It must have been most upsetting.
It can make life difficult when one's colleagues fail to recognize the research one engages in.
It is no great secret that we have been unjustly blamed for a great many things over the years.
It is through the ebb and flow of this cosmic tide that we find renewal and, in the end, peace.
It was nice to finally meet someone out here who doesn't want to rob you or take off your head.
It's quiet for now, Dragonborn. Perhaps later we'll find where one of those serpents is hiding.
Jarl is who you want to talk to. Always coin to be made killing off some Forsworn in the hills.
Join the forces mustering outside of [CAPITAL]. (Infos conditioned on Capital location go here)
Just don't lose yourself in the role. We have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation.
Just stay away from me and maybe I won't weave a spell to shrink something that matters to you.
Kodlak is the one who figures out who can be a Companion. So talk to him. It's out of my hands.
Let him know that we've unearthed something... Well, I'm not sure. Something unique, let's say.
Let me just take this coin purse off your hands for you. And those nice boots you've got there.
Let's just say the headsman's axe may not be the worst way for a Solitude Jail prisoner to die.
Let's pretend for a moment that a certain individual was looking to acquire a particular staff.
Listen, when you're ready to do something useful, find me outside Haemar's Shame, in Falkreath.
Look around, see if you see anything unusual. Any signs of the mound being disturbed. Anything.
Looks like it's going to be a bountiful harvest once again. The gods continue to smile upon us.
Maybe you're right. I guess I just didn't want anyone to think I couldn't handle one Nord lass.
Mercer must have triggered these pistons. We're going to have to search for a way to open them.
Most people in Skyrim don't care for Dunmer. Roggi's the only one around here even half-decent.
My name is Eorlund Gray-Mane. I work the Skyforge. Best steel in all of Skyrim. All of Tamriel.
My specialty is pickpocketing. All I need is a rich mark, a moon-lit sky and I'm in my element.
No day goes by where I am not tempted to return to my inborn nature. Zin krif horvut se suleyk.
No one is in charge here. Each Shield-Brother is his own man, each Shield-Sister her own woman.
No, I'm sorry, but I can't go anywhere with you. I won't. Please, I must get back to my duties.
No, I've been busy trying to keep the whole mine from collapsing, if that's all right with you.
No, not that kind of spell. Believe me when I say I wouldn't be asking if it weren't necessary.
No. She said my part was over. That my fate had moved beyond the Twilight, and I was on my own.
Nobody trusts those mages, way up north in their college. Gods only know what they do up there.
Now I have to spend a fortune to keep the whole thing quiet. Guess where that money comes from.
Now, clear your mind and breathe deeply. Good concentration is very important for spellcasting.
Now, if you'll both proceed to the armory to don your Nightingale Armor, we can begin the Oath.
Now, of course I must ask... Killing the Emperor... How much did Motierre pay for such a thing?
Of course you cannot. No one can. It is my lot as Chief of this tribe, and so I suffer quietly.
Of course, she would never admit such a thing. Captain Safia is far too proud a woman for that.
Oh you must be nobility of some sort. Running around partying and paying others to clean it up.
Oh, don't worry. I'll let you make it up to me. Now, where can we go for a little privacy, hmm?
Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend.  Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?
Oh, I quite like living in the hall. Mother says it's an honor to live there and serve Morthal.
Oh, really? You're just like my brother. Fine, but if you change your mind, I'll be right here.
On the coldest of nights, in the steam rising from my breath, I see the many faces of the dead.
Once he's dead, plant the incriminating letter on his body, and let fate take care of the rest.
Once M'aiq got in trouble in Riften, and fled to Windhelm. It is good that nobody there cared. 
One of them came in and demanded payment. Bolli tried to tell them no; stood up to them, but...
Orc chiefs should be strong and stand alone. They need no companions. Progeny is a poor excuse.
Other than that, watch your footing. In these wintry conditions, the stairs can be treacherous.
Pleased enough, I suppose. At least they appreciate the ways and traditions of the Nord people.
Remember to check behind you every once in a while. Who knows what might try to sneak up on us.
Save him. Let him perform his rite one more time. And when he does, we will be waiting for him.
Save him. Let him perform his rites one more time. And when he does, I will be waiting for him.
See that you do. I will not let Windhelm descend into chaos over a few overactive imaginations.
She's been with me ever since her parents were killed by bandits and she was dropped in my lap.
Skaggi tells me that you were bothering him today. Can't you and Torom just play by yourselves?
Skjor's heard rumors of a bear the size of a mammoth in Hammerfell. We're going to seek it out.
Skyrim is a beautiful and harsh mistress, but her people cling to such a petty notion of honor.
So the Alik'r know where I am? What did they offer you? Gold? How many more of them are coming?
So, you bring that staff back here, and I'll consider it payment for the item Arniel was after.
Some can't separate the animal from themselves. Go feral. This poor sod could have been anyone.
Some say Alduin is Akatosh. Some say M'aiq is a Liar. Don't you believe either of those things.
Something has to change soon or I may as well pack this place up and leave it for the skeevers.
Sorry, Marise. I just can't sit back and watch them treat us like a resource. This is our home!
Such an investment will mean that I can take better care of my family, as well as my customers.
Svana! Has that skooma-addled idiot Niluva paid us her rent yet? Or does she have more excuses?
Tell you what... if you still feel unsure, come by the temple sometime and we'll talk about it.
That is where your job ends and mine begins. The work of the mind, sadly undervalued in Skyrim.
That is your choice. We will not force you. But to join the Circle, your blood must be as ours.
The Akaviri blood seal can only be opened with the right kind of blood. Your blood, Dragonborn.
The architecture of this temple is marvelous. Have you ever seen stonework like this, Delphine?
The Augur was a brilliant mage. Truly inspired. Mastered spells others could barely comprehend.
The Black Star will never decay, but it can no longer hold the white souls of lesser creatures.
The dirt, the moisture... it's disgusting. Who wants to spend their life living like a skeever?
The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Rift, allowing the return of Jarl Laila Law-Giver.
The Greybeards are a solitary lot. I don't think they've ever ventured outside their monastery.
The Pale will be turned over to the Empire. Brina Merilis will assume the Jarlship in Dawnstar.
The Stormcloaks are gone, but Talos will never be forgotten. I don't care what the Thalmor say!
Then I'm afraid your suspension will stand for now. I'm sorry, but that's the way it has to be.
Then like Roggvir, you're a Nord at heart. It's hard for many of the people here to understand.
Then you've found your home, friend. Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth. Welcome.
There ain't much to offer, but if you wanna place dry to spend the night, I'll rent you a room.
There is much to do, and I need every able bodied man and woman committed to rebuilding Skyrim.
There is some good news though. I think the borders of the shrine may be smaller than we think.
Think he worked down at the smelter. Lot of the laborers there are sympathetic to the Forsworn.
This again?! That was different. Was I given a chance to object to the terms of the treaty? No.
This is all just too much, too fast. Go get some work from Nazir. I need time to... to think...
This is the happiest day of my life. Where should we live? My home is your home now, of course.
This must be their hive. We'll have to keep silent if we want to avoid drawing their attention.
This opens up entire new realms of research for us. Oh, if only Septimus were here to see this!
This wasn't supposed to happen. I thought they wanted my help, not to use me as a test subject!
This work isn't for everyone. Maybe you're more cut out for those snowberries up in Winterhold.
This... this is about the inheritance, isn't it? All right! I'll tell you where I've hidden it.
To cling to something past its usefulness is unseemly, how much more so when that thing is you?
To even consider it would be such a sign of weakness that I might as well abandon my tribe now.
Travel southeast and you'll find an Orc stronghold, up around the old Dushnikh orichalcum mine.
True, I may look the part of dashing swordsman, but I prefer the art of wit to that of warfare.
Trust me, there's no place better to forge relationships with the movers and shakers of Skyrim.
Trying to stay ahead of the Thalmor assassins. I'm not a hero like you. I don't stand a chance.
Used to have their own kingdom, till the Nords came, now they're at the bottom of the hay pile.
Walking around with your weapon out is bound to make people nervous. We understand each other? 
We draw council at Japhet's Folly. The fools in Windhelm won't go near it, which is fine by us.
We drink to our youth, and to days come and gone. For the age of oppression is now nearly done.
We should bow our heads in silent reverence for those who are interred in Falkreath's cemetery.
We work where we can get work. The Nords don't like unloading their ships, so we do it instead.
We've got him locked in there now, but he's still challenging anyone that looks crooked at him.
We've made you a fair offer. If you're really serious about this truce, you need to reconsider.
Welcome to the family, lad. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me.
Welcome, brother! I'm glad that your eyes have finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.
Well, if it works in the one case, why not the other? Don't you want to at least give it a try?
Well, look at the evidence. Nords generally don't trust magic, so it's not off to a good start.
Well, maybe that's not entirely true, but our clan's got a long an' proud history in this hold.
Well, that's one way to find out if they're real. I even know where we might find one. Lead on!
Well, there's an old sewer tunnel that dumps into the lake on the northwest side of the island.
Well... perhaps there is a way he could earn his place back at my side. Maybe. But no promises.
What dangers and wonders shall we discover in the frozen wastes? I can hardly wait to find out!
What the rebels like to forget, is that the Empire's what's keeping the Dominion out of Skyrim.
When my aunt got married, they had a cake that was three feet tall. I got really sick that day.
While we were off fighting the Elves in the Great War, Madanach was busy ruling over the Reach.
Will there ever come a time when the people of Skyrim no longer need our services? I think not.
Winterhold has lost much of its history, and with that much of its power. I aim to change that.
With Leifnarr gone, it's really put me in a terrible bind. I'm having trouble making ends meet.
Without birth there is no life, without death there is only stasis. Such is the truth of Arkay.
Woah there, lass. I appreciate the armor, but becoming a Nightingale? That was never discussed.
Wujeeta, you can't keep showing up here late. Bolli's just going to get someone to replace you.
Yes, but I need a show of loyalty from you. I don't need a shiv in the back while we break out.
Yes, I know. That last job was my fault. I obviously thought Niruin was ready, but I was wrong.
You better get back to Whiterun right away. Jarl Balgruuf will want to know what happened here.
You don't like the Nords? Fine. But pledging your whole life to killing them? That's just dumb.
You have learned so much already, Dragonborn. Growing your gift too quickly would be dangerous.
You know, I took some classes at the Bards College as a youth. Poems come in handy when wooing.
You should speak to the priest in the Temple of Mara to arrange the ceremony. No sense waiting.
You should unload some of that unwanted gear. Head over to Sadri's Used Wares, talk to the Elf.
You sure? It was in your handwriting. If you can't keep the books straight then let me do them.
You want to work on something that's not officially allowed? Don't tell anyone you're doing it.
You, place that hammer on the shrine. You're the only one who's proven worthy in all of this...
You'll want to watch yourself in Riften. A lot of ways to get yourself in trouble in that town.
You're a traveler, right? I have this letter for him. Let him know how much of a failure he is.
Your superior and I were simply having a... discussion about my level of access to the College.
[QUOTE]Olaf captured a fast-sleeping dragon, a mighty feat which the meek would not fail.[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]Olaf was Numinex in human form, on moonless nights he would spread wings and sail.[QUOTE]
A great darkness is growing, and soon we will be called to fight it, on these shores or abroad. 
After all, repentance is something you deny to Paarthurnax by meting out your so-called justice.
After you're done with all this, come back anytime, and I'll make good on my end of the bargain.
Alduin's wings, they did darken the sky. His roar fury's fire, and his scales sharpened scythes.
All I need is a messenger to bring Her words to these poor souls by distributing these missives.
And don't think for a moment I've forgotten it was you that lost us the hold in the first place.
And if Alduin wins, man is gone from this world. Lost in the shadow of the black wings unfurled.
And the parts that are readable... well... bardic verse has come a long way since ancient times.
Any king who denies the Emperor will wake one morning to face the Legion staring down his gates.
Are you a fool? Look at the bodies around you. Even if you're blind, surely you smell the blood.
Are you crazy? What were you thinkin'? You can't just go around doin' things the way you please!
Are you married? You look the type. Make sure you treat your wife with the respect she deserves.
As long as the rebels are willing to die fighting the Empire, we must be willing to oblige them.
At some point we should hire Tekla on here. If she could just spend less time serving Dengeir...
At the end of that path is a clearing and an old standing stone. I'd ask you both meet me there.
At this very moment, he's layin' the groundwork for the Guild to reestablish itself in Windhelm.
Besides, nothing tells the people of Riften we mean business better than a huge column of smoke.
Best of all, he's also pledged to open doors for us in Solitude and to get things rollin' again.
But Mikael... He sings only for gold and the affections of wenches. He dishonors our traditions.
But on the other, the scarcity of supplies has led to some, well, [QUOTE]elevated[QUOTE] prices.
But there must be more to it than that. Did something... strange... happen when the dragon died?
But you can bet he'll be trying to figure it out. This could shift the whole balance of the war.
But you can hear me, obviously. Something still isn't quite right. At least I'm making progress.
By the gods, a dragon's been sighted just south of the city, flying around Lost Tongue Overlook.
Come on, everyone in town knows that you spend more time with Fastred than fishing in the river.
Contacts are springin' up all over and I've got young footpads beatin' down the door to join up.
Damn place is filled with this reddish mist. Can't see more than ten feet in front of your face.
Dear sister. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated.
Difference is, the Gray-Manes turned their backs on the Empire and we Battle-Borns stayed loyal.
Don't worry, my friend, I'll spare you the facetious quip about killing a defenseless old woman.
Don't you think all your tramping around there investigating might have something to do with it?
Dragons, murder, rebellion... and we sail right into the middle of it with the Emperor on board.
Easy, huh? So, should I just hand you purses of coin or are you going to work to earn your keep?
Eh, fine. I can tell you aren't worth the trouble. Just get out of here before I change my mind.
Ever since I took over as the foreman the production of our mead has never been more profitable.
Every other day, seems one of the laborers runs off in the hills saying he'll join the Forsworn.
Everything that represents Nocturnal's influence is contained within the walls of the Sepulcher.
Faendal thinks he can woo Camilla Valerius away from me. She's already mine, I keep telling him.
Finally, all the pieces of Mehrunes' Razor are in my hands. It's time I let you in on something.
General Tullius has his headquarters in Castle Dour, in the city of Solitude, northwest of here.
Go. Tell your commanders you have won. I, my family, and my men will be gone before they arrive.
Good thing you did for Nurelion, retrieving that phial for him before he died. Man was obsessed.
He's from the battle, I just know it. He's one of Tiber Septim's soldiers... back from the dead.
Her name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
Hmph. My family. All that wealth and they squander it on foolish ventures and political schemes.
How I envy you. I can only imagine the excitement of seeing history through the eyes of another!
Huh. Heard you broke out of Cidhna Mine with those Forsworn. Do you have any idea how many died?
I almost didn't. I wasn't sure I could stomach having some Imperial tell me how to live my life.
I do what's necessary so we can get by. Have to, since I can't count on my brother for anything.
I get to help mother with the shop. I used to help papa too... 'till I tried to use the forge...
I guess we have our entire lives together, now. Where should we live? You could stay with me....
I hate working these parties. Some of the guests are nice, but there's always a few like Erikur.
I have a family heirloom you can have. Supposed to be sort of valuable. I hope that's all right.
I heard Lucan yelling the other day about a thief breaking into his store. It wasn't me, honest!
I just got lucky is all. Bumped into someone who knew someone else. The rest just writes itself.
I just wanted to let you know that Ancano's been asking about you. I think he's looking for you.
I know it well. Or at least, I've heard of it. I would wager that carving once depicted a skull.
I learned the ways of the blade in the Great War. Nearly lost my life outside the Imperial City.
I owe it all to my father who started me swinging the pickaxe when I was a barefoot little girl.
I remember you... you were with us at Helgen. I heard you joined us. Welcome to the Stormcloaks!
I said I'm fine, Madena. I won't have some court mage fixing me up like some magical experiment.
I see. Well yes, I suppose I did mention it, though I'm not sure what he expects me to tell you.
I think Bryling's the one you want to talk to. I'm mostly just here to scare away the riff raff.
I want to pay you, but I had to cover up the murder. Didn't expect you to go on a killing spree.
I'd be glad to help a friend of Hadvar. But you didn't answer my question - how do you know him?
I'd kill you where you stand if I wasn't bound by my oath as an officer of the Aldmeri Dominion.
I'd like to know why you're wasting time asking about it when you should already be on your way.
I'd make it worth your while. No one would notice a few missing ingots out of the next shipment.
I'll give you a few more minutes. I can't wait here all day. It's my neck on the line, remember.
I'll go back to the Orphanage in a while. I'll give them time to, you know... clean up the mess.
I'm afraid he's had to reschedule, my grace. By all accounts, waging war takes his every moment.
I'm part of a group that's been looking for you... well, someone like you, for a very long time.
I'm sorry to hear that. I thought your eyes had finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.
I'm sorry, but you've been suspended from the College. I can't be seen talking to you right now.
I'm too weak right now. Between the spiders and the coven, I'd be dead before escaping the cave.
I've got a hungry daughter to feed, so selling my produce is really the only thing I care about.
If he paid what he owes, I wouldn't have to say anything. Besides, what in Oblivion do you care?
If Nocturnal was truly displeased with me... with any of us, she wouldn't have answered my call.
If the Night Mother really did give you an order to talk to a contact, we'd be mad to ignore it.
If you can remain calm, even in the midst of chaos, your arrow will most likely find its target.
If you do good works for the people and purchase a home from my steward, I'll name you my Thane.
If you're looking for a good attitude go see the Bards. They'll fake it for you if nothing else.
In fact, if you could retrieve a few things for me, I could start on my next set of experiments.
Indeed. Being a drunken boor is thirsty work. And I can't seem to find my way back to the bar...
Is that the one about something buried beneath Saarthal? Something that men and mer fought over?
It doesn't last long, though. The blood of your foes can sustain you. If you're willing to feed.
It is by Shor's command that we curb our wrath - so let's feast and sing 'til our fate calls us.
It just feels right somehow, having this new life as an adventurer. It's what I was meant to do.
It means signing on for the Nord ideas of how to live your life. Honor, battle, glory, all that.
It should hurt. A lot. But I'm not paying for murder. Oh, if you're caught, it's not my problem.
It stops at once, or else there will be consequences of an unpleasant nature. Do you understand?
It was you convinced the Jarl to trap that dragon in the keep. And by Ysmir, it actually worked.
It's a small group of us here at the College. Favors don't go unremembered. Neither do affronts.
It's been a good week, my boy! Loud customers mean good cheer, and good cheer means a full till!
It's been so long since we've had any contact with the Greybeards. Do you really have the Voice?
It's called [QUOTE]Nettlebane.[QUOTE] The hags terrify me, or I would have gone after it myself.
It's hard to recover from something like the Great Collapse, but I believe Winterhold can do it.
It's Nilsine Shatter-Shield, in Windhelm. If Nilsine dies, too... I'll make it worth your while.
It's true that his crimes are long in the past, but justice does not count the passage of years.
Jarl Igmund will go into exile, with Thongvor Silver-Blood taking his place as Jarl of Markarth.
Judgment will be passed on your actions to come, and how you deal with the dangers ahead of you.
Just browsin' today. If the gods be kind, someone will take mercy on me and spare a few septims.
Just keep on Gulum-Ei's tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.
Karliah and I were like partners. I went with her on every heist. We watched each other's backs.
Karliah didn't even want it, she wanted to keep the sale a secret. I can see how well that went.
Magic? Got no good use for that here. Mages keep to their College in Winterhold. Go bother them.
Many of us have begun to question Alduin's lordship, whether his Thu'um was truly the strongest.
Markarth's a different place, now. Do business here, and you do business with the Thieves Guild.
Maybe we'll pay you a visit tonight, little spy. We got ways of finding out what you really are.
Me? I like to talk to my targets before the kill. Taunt them, scare them... even challenge them.
Me? I ran... and I ran... straight through the gates of Windhelm and all the way back to Riften.
Meet me back in Riverwood. If I'm not back when you get there, wait for me. I shouldn't be long.
My boy, he always did have an eye for the pretty ones. That Vittoria ain't bad, for an Imperial.
My brother keeps trying to spin these fantasies to me about my aunts and our father. He's crazy.
My business is falling apart, my apprentice never listens to me and now there's talk of dragons.
My family has owned Karthwasten for generations. Rare for anyone in the Reach that isn't a Nord.
My father was a Legionnaire, and his before him. I guess I never considered doing anything else.
My father, the great Bear of Eastmarch, died during my imprisonment after the Markarth Incident.
My master and I had a bit of a falling out. We got into an argument and it got rather... heated.
My wife's a good woman. She can be a little hard-headed sometimes, but I love her just the same.
Need a drink, you go to the Bee and Barb. Stay out of the Ragged Flagon, stay out of the Ratway.
New to Narzulbur? If you're smart, you'll keep moving. There is a wicked shadow over this place.
No, I openly welcome the presence of armed strangers who have no reason to care about any of us.
No, we usually let them go. I refused to do it, and Garthek ordered the clan to kill me as well.
Not against me. Against all of Falkreath. Those Imperial bastards are spying on every one of us.
Not very good quality, is it? Probably came from the Gray Quarter. Have a talk with Revyn Sadri.
Not yet. You know you're asking for some pretty strange stuff, don't you? It's not easy to find.
Now if you were to help tidy up and perhaps apologize afterwards... I might be able to help you.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to figure out how we're going to fill our recently emptied mine.
Of course. My fellow Harbingers and I have been warming ourselves here. Trying to evade Hircine.
Ogmund the skald. He's old, respected, and I know for a fact that he worships Talos in his home.
Oh and you'll need the hip bone... it's very important. No entering Pelagius' Wing without that.
Oh that's very sweet of you. Anything you can find out from Captain Aldis would be welcome news.
Oh, excuse me, milady. I'll be glad to sell you an elixir after I'm done with these fine people.
Oh, excuse me, milord. I'll be glad to sell you an elixir after I'm done with these fine people.
Oh, wipe that frown off your face Rogatus. You've been wearing that frown for over 50 years now.
On the other hand, the Thalmor have considerable funds and are looking to expand their shipping.
Once you've made a bit of a name for yourself, Skjor and Vilkas might have things for you to do.
Only if you don't know how to use it. All the great heroes have had to learn to use their power.
Or else what? You think you can stand against the entire Whiterun city guard? The gate's closed.
Our own security forces are limited, and all the mercenaries are tied up in this ridiculous war.
Pardon me, but I trust you've been working on your poem, on the classical heroes of Skyrim, yes?
Perhaps some more Glow Dust in the next batch of potions. That should increase their resistance.
Pfft. I'm the oldest woman in Dawnstar. Was here when the Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger.
Phinis is one of the best Conjurers in all of Skyrim, and can help with spells from that school.
Pity no one told the Elves. Whole group of those Thalmor came and they demanded Ulfric's arrest.
Precisely. There are a few who still call Nocturnal [QUOTE]Lady Luck[QUOTE] and for good reason.
Projects are underway to discern the origin and nature of the College's recent find in Saarthal.
Raise the taxes, then! Put anyone that refuses to pay in the stocks and make an example of them.
Really. We aren't interested in seeing all that. Remove yourself until you are properly attired!
Sell-swords are common in Skyrim, but you'll find precious few as stout and as a strong as I am.
She was always so close to being Empress, but despite her machinations, it was never to be hers.
Shutting this place down would dishonor my family's heritage, but what other choice will I have?
Skyrim is well known to be full of these... Draugr, ancient Nord warriors who cannot find peace.
Skyrim needs a High King who will fight for her, and Whiterun needs a Jarl who will do the same.
So great was his reign in life, when he ascended to the heavens he was made lord of the Divines.
So is it Riften or Rifton? This place has changed its name so many times, I can't even remember.
So you can spend it on drinks at the Bannered Mare? If it's food you need, ask for that instead.
So, you're the new recruit everyone's been talking about, eh? I guess it's about time we talked.
Sorry, sir. These old bones do like a bit of warmth in the evening. There's no need to make fun.
Talk of strange happenings at Autumnshade Clearing, just north of the lake. My guess? Spriggans.
Tamriel is full of wisdom and magic, if one is willing to look for it. Few have their eyes open.
Tell me something. Do you enjoy spending Lady Maven's gold for her? It certainly seems that way.
That fetcher! I gave him the same keg just this morning and told him to store it in the cellars.
That last brigade of soldiers said there's a tall forest on the eastern edge of the White River.
That means he has the pick of the litter from some of the finest goods to grace Skyrim's shores.
That must have been a hard bit of business. I hear Stentor had been alive for a long, long time.
That woman and her Thalmor Justiciars have caused nothing but problems for the people of Skyrim.
The College of Whispers hopes to learn that our College also supports these avenues of research.
The Dragonborn is an exception to all the rules - the Dragon Blood itself is a gift of the gods.
The General and I have our disagreements, but he's the best hope for both the Empire and Skyrim.
The Jarl's palace in Whiterun? Ah, yes... the old story about King Olaf's pet dragon. Ingenious!
The laboratory adjoins the library. I'm hoping we'll find a sample of the Torpor left undamaged.
The new initiates are working out well. Eager, dedicated, and not afraid to get their hands wet.
The old man and I have our differences when it comes to this. It's a blessing, given by Hircine.
The stone was pried off of Barenziah's ceremonial crown by a thief in order to cover his tracks.
The Throne of Ysgramor! The throne of my father...  I only hope I can prove worthy of the honor.
The Treasury House is really just for patrons of the Silver-Blood family. You don't belong here.
Then like Roggvir, you have a Nord's heart. It's hard for many of the people here to understand.
Then there's no time to lose. It won't take long for Sarthis's associates to learn of his death.
There are forts like this all over Skyrim. The Imperials abandoned most of them a long time ago.
There's a smart lad. Take the map. The loot's hidden there. It'll show itself when you get near.
They say that our cause is false and that we are nothing more than thieves, thugs and murderers!
They're remnants of the old rulers of Markarth. Natives of the Reach. Followers of the old ways.
This giant... It's not the only thing in Fallowstone Cave. Getting to it isn't going to be easy.
This is a private home, and the master of the house is a very old man. He's not to be disturbed.
This is no time for cold feet. I've put everything in your hands here, not least Malborn's life.
This is one of the signs. The signs that Lady Mara is displeased with your constant inebriation.
This isn't a command. Just decency. Help out an old blacksmith. I've got to get back to my work.
This isn't over. I catch you sending one letter to General Tullius, I'll have you both executed.
This one angered someone pretty high up in the keep. Can I count on you to get this done for me?
This place could be massive... very easy to get lost. We have to be careful not to lose our way.
Took an incredible amount of work to get it running again. Now I'm hoping it'll all be worth it.
Vex and Delvin are having to turn clients away at this point, it's almost impossible to keep up.
We actually got a request from one of the most powerful families in Whiterun, the Battle-Born's.
We have been in this land for so long, I have forgotten what it feels like to walk on warm sand.
We may be Nightingales, but in our hearts we're still thieves and we're damn good at what we do.
We'd better get out of here. I don't think this place is going to stand up to much more of this.
We'll cross to the White River and follow it to Windhelm. Then we can swing south to Kynesgrove.
We're not mining up any ore with those undead around, so I wouldn't go down there if I were you.
We've made you a fair offer. Are you serious about these talks, or are you just here to posture?
Welcome to the cozy little family. I'm one of the lookouts for the Guild. I watch Delvin's back.
Welcome to the family, lass. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me.
Well met, friend. It's good to see you're still in one piece, with all the trouble you get into.
Well, seems like you have a bit of gold left in your pockets, don't you, my friend?  Mmm, yes...
Well, that's not bad. But I was thinking [QUOTE]Mogo's Mead[QUOTE] really gets the place moving.
Well, the giants took care of him, and you took care of the giants. Two problems solved at once.
What are you doing here? The excavation site is closed. I don't need any more workers or guards.
What do you think this is? We don't do battle with magic around here, new blood. Now come at me.
What's the matter with you? We said keep it clean! Well, you can just forget about your payment.
Wise decision. The vaults in the Hall of the Vigilant will guard this against future temptation.
Wish I could head inside Solitude myself. Wouldn't mind seeing Roggvir get what's coming to him.
Yeah, yeah, dog gets master, master gets cosmic axe, everyone's happy. Just get over here, mutt.
Yes, markedly so. Ulfric and his Stormcloaks made no secret of their disdain for the Dark Elves.
Yes, of course. We'll have more time to look around later, I suppose. Let's see what's up ahead.
You must also pledge unswerving loyalty to your fellow Stormcloaks, to Skyrim and to her people.
You'll find tonics, salves, poultices and potions on my shelves. Browse to your heart's content.
You'll want to speak with Mirabelle Ervine right away. And welcome to the College of Winterhold.
You're gouging me for what little coin I make and you can't even protect yourselves? Ridiculous!
You're wrong. Ulfric. We need the Empire. Without it Skyrim will assuredly fall to the Dominion.
Your targets are the beggar Narfi, an ex-miller named Ennodius Papius, and Beitild, a mine boss.
Zu'u lost ofan hin laan... now that I have answered your question, you will allow me to go free?
[QUOTE]Olaf struck a deal to make himself king, Numinex let go though none tell that tale.[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]We're safe[QUOTE] he says. You'll eat those words when a draugr is tearing into your face.
A dastardly group, but they're more than simple brigands. Shrewd. Clever. Not to be trifled with.
A small container, made of the magically infused snow that first fell on the Throat of the World.
Ah, excellent. Well, here's the gold the Jarl offered in exchange for taking care of the problem.
Ah, no. Don't think you've got the stuff. Come back when you've seen a bit more in life, perhaps.
Ah, Vlindrel Hall's a fine home, if you can afford it. The steward in the keep can tell you more.
Ahhhh... No, no Elven spices. Just some salt, to preserve it. You're not afraid of salt, are you?
All I care about is two things: watchin' Maven's back and countin' the gold she pays me to do it.
All I need is someone to deliver it for me. If anyone saw me leave Riften, they'd get suspicious.
All right men, spread out and search the tower. No telling who- or what- we're dealing with here.
All right, prisoner. Eyes front. You're in Cidhna Mine, now. And we expect you to earn your keep.
All right... All right... Fine. I thought we were friends, but you're a real jerk, you know that?
And here you are. Champion of Namira. Keeper of her ring. You're everything I hoped you would be.
And in return, both in life and in death, you must serve as a guardian of the Twilight Sepulcher.
And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.
And so the Tongues freed us from Alduin's rage. Gave the gift of the Voice, ushered in a new Age.
And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.
And that, my nervous little friend, has not happened. Would you care to comment on that, perhaps?
And the fiercest foes rout when they hear triumph's shout, Dragonborn, for your blessing we pray!
And you. If you're here for treasure, or wisdom, or anything, I'm afraid you've wasted your time.
Apparently so many people sought his death, Astrid had to hold a lottery to determine the client.
As Mara is my witness, if I didn't have this hood on right now I would spit right in your face...
At last. I can rest safely. You have done me a great service, warrior. I cannot thank you enough.
Because it's boring. The fields are going to do fine... you don't have to dote over them so much.
But I have many more rooms to clean. Fort Greymoor is quite large, and rather filthy if I do say.
But it was all a mistake. You weren't supposed to be on that cart with those Stormcloak traitors.
But now that I've got Rocksplinter here, I can cut through stone like a hot knife through butter.
But of course. You and I have a date with destiny. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm?
But our oath as Blades binds us. Paarthurnax must die. There's no excuse now that Alduin is dead.
But that was precisely the point! He was a puppet-king of the Empire , not a High King of Skyrim.
But there's always been a kind of honor to it. We don't deal in politics or underhanded sneaking.
By doing this, he's compromised our ties to Nocturnal and in essence, caused our luck to run dry.
By Sheor, no. Those archaic policies died out with the Mages Guild, and were never enforced here.
Closest town from here is Riverwood. My uncle's the blacksmith there. I'm sure he'd help you out.
Come see my collection of Gray-Mane's finest trinkets! You'll not find their like in all Tamriel!
Consider this an extremely risky job but with a massive potential for profit, and you'll do fine.
Could be if one side wants to keep the other from coming across, they might try to knock it down.
Crimson Nirnroot? I'd heard such a strain existed, but never imagined I'd see any in my lifetime.
Dear brother. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated.
Did they really record the star positions from Curalmil's tomb? There's no way it's that precise.
Doesn't matter... the title is yours. I henceforth name you Thane of Riften. Don't disappoint me.
Don't take offense to the nicknames, morsel. I'm a werewolf. Hard not to think of you as a snack.
Eehh.. Calixto and his books are often confused about such matters. It happens to the best of us.
Eorlund Gray-Mane's a stubborn fool. Our friendship ended when he turned his back on the Emperor.
Erikur assures me that Captain Volf will spend pretty much the rest of his life clapped in irons.
Esbern was one of the Blades archivists, back before the Thalmor smashed us during the Great War.
Even right this moment, I feel strange... when I don't think I should be feeling anything at all.
Ever been to Markarth? Some say it was built by the dwarves. I don't believe a word of it though.
Excellent. I'll send the proper letters, then, and have some fresh horses delivered straightaway.
Farewell, mortal. Know that Azura will be guarding over the threads of your fate in the Twilight.
Feel free to sit and put your head down on the table for as long as you like. I won't bother you.
Find Arniel Gane. He's somewhere in the northern section of the ruins. He'll show you what to do.
First of all, a son of Skyrim rots in an Imperial prison. We'll be getting him out of there soon.
For all we know, he's here to scout out the College. I'm sure they want to undermine our efforts.
General Tullius does not run this city, Thane Erikur. Or have you forgotten your oaths of fealty?
Good work. Knowing more about the enemy's position makes it that much easier to take it from him.
Grant me the power to break through this barrier and to send the Skull to the depths of Oblivion!
Ha ha! That's funny. Ya' think you can take me on? Try it anytime. I've been itching for a fight.
Haelga! That's just it. I can't keep up with you. Your Dibellan techniques... they're exhausting.
Halldir was the missing link. Rjorn entered Halldir's Cairn in secret, and presumably died there.
Have you found it difficult to get provisions lately? I can scarcely feed the staff in my palace.
Having Goldenglow kept in line by the Thieves Guild has kept the honey flowing with minimal cost.
He isn't exactly in the Guild, but he pays us a cut of all the stuff he lifts from the warehouse.
He told me it was from Labyrinthian, and that I would know what to do with it when the time came.
He was one of the smelter workers. I used to have a job down there myself, casting silver ingots.
He's a friend. Saved my life in fact. Come on, I'll explain everything, but we need to go inside.
He's been digging around the records the Blades left here, too. But we can talk about that later.
He's claimed three victims that I know of, though maybe there's more that haven't been found yet.
He's gone in to defile our family tomb by using our ancestors for his filthy dark elf necromancy.
He's not spying, but it's clear the Empire is making Lod smith up more swords and armor for them.
He's still in town, getting by plying spells to the people inside the Frozen Hearth. Disgraceful.
Here we are. Dawnstar. Capital of the Pale. Don't get up this way much. Beautiful country though.
Here's a dead dragon, and that's something I definitely understand. Now we know we can kill them.
Hey boy, I heard you nailed a Septim into Lucan's doorstep. Damn near drove him crazy. That true?
His cause may be true, but the man is a lie... all he holds in his heart his lust for the throne.
His head will be sent to Cyrodiil where it will adorn a spike on the walls of the Imperial City. 
Hmm? Sorry, I was lost in thought. I'm planning my wedding, you see. So many details to work out.
Honningbrew uses only the finest natural honey, not that sludge you'll find at Goldenglow Estate.
Hopefully they made it to safety before the attack.  I'll begin the search after a quick restock.
How about the gold? Did you remember to bring it or is that too difficult an instruction as well.
How does anyone know there was a city of Winterhold? M'aiq did not see it with his eyes. Did you?
How unfortunate he has to dig through refuse like that. Someone should give him a piece of bread.
How wonderful. Like the sea, their love roils and swells, but brings life and nourishment to all.
I assume everyone's gone ahead of us as planned. I just swept through the castle, no one's here. 
I can't believe Grelod is dead. I had no love for the woman, but to be murdered, in cold blood...
I don't know about such things, but I heard the Greybeards summon you. That's good enough for me.
I don't know why I'm saying this, but if you find it out in your travels, I'd be grateful to you.
I feel pity for these Nords. When the dragons attack cities and towns, they will lose everything.
I had no idea you were a man of violence. What exactly are your intentions in this blessed place?
I have told Idgrod of your concerns. She'll look after you all. Please, go back to your business.
I haven't heard from her lately. I've tried talking to Captain Aldis but he hasn't been any help.
I picked up a set of fine silver brushes in the city, Reldith. I thought you might be interested.
I see. That power certainly exists, I assure you. Wield it faithfully, and few can withstand you.
I should have expected as much. Fine, I shall give you 200 gold, and you shall leave me in peace.
I understand he settled down in Hjaalmarch, and his presence there caused something of a problem.
I used some contacts in the Legion, asked some questions. Was told I should mind my own business.
I used to dream of it. In the dream, I was standing... someplace high up... a tower, or mountain.
I was hoping you'd offer. I didn't think it was my place to ask such a favor of you. I thank you.
I wish there were another way, Dragonborn, but it falls to you to serve justice upon Paarthurnax.
I'd even buy one of your relatives, if you're looking to sell. Ha ha ha ha. That's a little joke.
I'll turn you back over to your Legion. Legate Cipius will have use for you. Gods be with us all.
I'm searching for my Fenrig. He was marching with Gjukar's men, who they say were wiped out here.
I'm sorry you disapprove, father. But I've made up my mind. I'm not a warrior, I'm a businessman.
I'm supposed to be holding a tasting of the new Honningbrew Reserve for the Captain of the Guard.
I'm what you'd call of soldier of fortune. Make me an offer, and I just might fight at your side.
I've already removed the boards so the meadery would get infested. That's where you should start.
I've been trying to put those up around the city, to warn people. Have them keep their eyes open.
I've gotten good at listening to keyholes. At the door in the basement, I hear her talking to me.
I've heard that shadowy figures are being seen coming in and out of the Black Door. Gods help us.
If it's a lady you're looking for, you'd best look elsewhere. Once Mikael gets them, they're got.
If it's my fate to be ended by a dragon, so be it. Meantime, I'll live my life the way I want to.
If that's what you really believe, then you're a fool. Never had much patience for fools, myself.
If the Companions would hunt in the name of their lord, Hircine, we would be granted great power.
If this is about battle magic, forget it. I've told every Jarl I've served under that I won't....
If you can learn to be subtle in rendering death, perhaps I will share more of my power with you.
If you don't like that kind of work, talk to Delvin. He runs the more up-close and personal jobs.
If you journey north, keep well away from Snapleg Cave. Damned Hagravens have infested the place.
If you think you'll make your fortune kickin' around the Flagon all day, that's where your wrong.
If you're here about the nightmares, I'm afraid my pleas to the College of Winterhold go unheard.
If you're so curious, talk to Nelacar, in the Frozen Hearth. He can tell you the whole sad story.
Infiltrating an occupied fort and making it out in one piece is nothing to joke about. Well done.
It is long since one of the living has entered here. May Shor's favor follow you and your errand.
It means I have a business to run, I need to have the books straight and you're barely ever here!
It means you can kill dragons and steal their power - even speak with a dragon's voice, they say.
It was the Empire killed her! I know it! They killed her so they can blame it on the Stormcloaks!
It's a shame our daughter couldn't make the journey herself, but at least she still thinks of us.
It's about your singing. Well, not your singing, your songs. But you know what I'm talking about.
It's locked. See if you can get it open with some picks. We might need that gold once we get out.
It's... in a hollowed-out rock. In the tundra. A bit west of Whiterun. Now please... please stop.
J'zargo will give you scrolls, you will use them and report the results. This is a good plan, no?
Just remember, if she tells you to do somethin'... you damn well better do exactly what she says.
Kynareth has blessed you with tremendous compassion, Silana. You will find a way, I'm sure of it.
Last week a scholar came to us. He said he knew where we could find another fragment of Wuuthrad.
Lately I've had my hands full suppressing these ridiculous accusations of corruption in the keep.
Let me know if you want to practice some more. Next time we'll make it a little more challenging.
Let me see... ah, yes. This is the Wheelstone. It's an heirloom symbol of the power of Windhelm. 
Look, you've already been told you're not allowed here. Turn around and go back the way you came.
Many have braved the shadowed vale but vain is all courage against the peril that guards the way.
Maybe. For now just lay low and do your job. I have a feeling we'll be rid of the Captain soon...
Mmm, yes... Brelas, is that the one? I hope you're not thinking of cutting me out, are you? Haha.
My king. Madanach. When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines.
My mother taught me the millwork trade... you know, which trees to cut and which ones to pass up.
My sister passed away some years ago, so I settled down here and opened the House of Curiosities.
My wife Seren and I run it together. She still smiths even though we found out she is with child.
Nearly broke my back out in the mines today. Damn Nords should bleed for putting us through this!
No more talk of Shel. As chief, I will do what I please, so point your fiery gaze to our enemies.
No, only one option remains. I will send you inside the Star. You will banish Malyn's soul there.
No, that's pushing it too far. Very exciting but highly unlikely, I can't possibly write that in.
No. I'm not. I feel like my scales are clawing into me. Maybe you could help an old Argonian out?
Normally, I would have welcomed someone like you -- resourceful, clearly no friend of the Empire.
Not long, in truth. I came to Skyrim after I found myself unwelcome in both Elsweyr and Cyrodiil.
Not my problem. Not even a little. Take it to Tolfdir, he's supposed to be looking after you lot.
Now that's what I like to hear. Good work. I think you deserve some gold from my tips at the inn.
Now we have to kick you out until things cool down. Can't give you any jobs or payouts for goods.
Now, if you're here on his behalf, I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist on my original payment.
Now, we'll take our friend here back to Hammerfell, where she will pay the price for her treason.
Of a sort. I don't have formal training in the Restoration school, but... something just as good.
Oh gods, what did you do that for? This is horrible. I'm not paying for murder. Get away from me.
Oh no, I'm not talking about that. I'm not being blamed for saying something out of place. Again.
Oh right, the rum. Thank you. I developed a taste for it after a fair weather trip to Hammerfell.
Oh, you could? I sure would love to have it again. Could show you some of my old scouting tricks.
Our master craftsman are nothing compared to the perfection of the Daedra. Look at how it shines.
Perhaps. But he spoke of this [QUOTE]curse[QUOTE] to you, which means it has deeply affected him.
Pick up your mess, then apologize, and if we think you're sincere we'll consider lending you aid.
Secondly, we got a couple of Imperial spies roaming through the hold. Need to put an end to that.
Septimus is clever among men, but he is but an idiot child compared to the dullest of the Dwemer.
So the Emperor had a decoy. Poor bastard got murdered, too. But then, I guess that was his job...
Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to get even more interesting.
Starting to get too old to work all day, but hopefully Master Hlaalu will let me slow down a bit.
Stick to the rules and you'll end up rich. Break them and you're out on your arse. Simple, right?
That dragon should've stuck with killing Imperials. Now he's going to learn how real Nords fight.
That's abominable. Barbaric. I'll have no part of this. Why didn't you tell me what you intended?
That's right. Dawnstar. My Dawnstar is plagued with nightmares. I haven't slept properly in days.
The blood of Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer, and Orsimer. The elves still living provide the key.
The city's ruled by the Jarl up in Dragonsreach. That's the fortress, there, up on the tall hill.
The Dark Brotherhood? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You think this is the first contract I've had on my life?
The excavation, Aicantar! Right after I finish my book. We'll start excavating Nchuand-Zel again.
The goddess's divine blessings have no doubt helped make Whiterun a thriving and prosperous city.
The Goldenglow Estate job has undoubtedly interrupted the supply of honey I need to make my mead.
The Mythic Dawn worshipped Dagon as a god. Having his Razor would be invaluable to my collection.
The Nords drove them out of the city. Ulfric Stormcloak and his men. That was about 20 years ago.
The way things have been going around here, it's a relief that our plan went off without a hitch.
They appear to have little interest in real study and research for the sake of gaining knowledge.
They definitely have some magic in them, I can tell you that much. But it's nothing I know about.
Things hinge on Whiterun. If we can take the city without bloodshed all the better. But if not...
This far? We're livin' in a sewer. You said we'd have a house as big as the Black-Briars' by now.
This is the headquarters of the Nightingales, cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind.
This is the most sacred mountain in Skyrim. Zok revak strunmah. The great mountain of the world. 
Trouble? He's one of the most stubborn lizards I've ever met! You have your work cut out for you.
Turns out, we fatally underestimated the Thalmor. They smashed us with ease during the Great War.
Typically we avoid bestowing it upon men, but for the Sybil's escort, we could make an exception.
Underneath the College. It's not the nicest place, so if you go down there, please do be careful.
Until those people learn to accept the Argonians, they must remain outside, for their own safety.
Wait a moment, you're not talking about Goldenglow, are you? Even our little Vex couldn't get in.
We do the best we can, even though we have next to nothing. But we Nords don't give up, not ever.
We got a nickname for anyone who trifles with us guards here in Windhelm - [QUOTE]Suicide.[QUOTE]
We had some trouble, while back. Stormcloak tried to set the mill on fire. But we sorted her out.
We have learned from our mistakes. Malacath's needs come first, and we will serve him faithfully.
We must have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack.
We want Imperial forces to withdraw from Winterhold, and allow Jarl Kraldar to return from exile.
We'd better keep moving. I don't want to run into any Imperials who know what happened at Helgen.
Well I'll be damned. We heard you were dead. Motierre's in the back room, if you've got business.
Well I'm glad you were there. I don't know how I would have gotten past the Forsworn without you.
Well, well. Looks like one of the Dark Brotherhood rats escaped its burning nest. I can fix that.
Well. Must preserve some professional secrets, mustn't we? I have my sources... reliable sources.
Well... all right. Just because we are friends. Give me, say... 750 gold and we can call it even.
What did you expect? That no one was going to notice you butting into business that wasn't yours?
What is it Ulfric's always saying... [QUOTE]On my honor as a Nord, I swear it.[QUOTE] (Laughter).
What's the bloody hold up in there? How long can it take to run through a few scraggly assassins?
When I grow up, I'm going to be an assassin. That way I can help lots of children, just like you.
When you showed up here, I knew you were the one the Greybeards sent, and not some Thalmor plant.
Why do you tolerate him, mother? All he contributes to this family is embarrassment and disgrace.
Wonderful. You've just made an important contribution to the advancement of a Dwemer scholarship.
Wonderfully done. Pelagius is finally ready to love himself... and continue hating everyone else.
Word is spreading like magefire! The great evil has been vanquished! You have truly saved us all!
Yeah. I'm glad we can finally stand down- getting tired of looking over my shoulder all the time.
Yes, I know Winterhold used to be full of my kind, and no I don't care that they're all gone now.
You and I have a date with destiny, it would seem. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm?
You can waste your own time, not mine. An apprentice obeys his master. A good one does, at least.
You didn't hear it from me, but if you want a real drink, try the Cornerclub in the Gray Quarter.
You hard of hearing? I run this smelter. And I'm late meeting our silver quota. What do you want?
You have my brother and I, obviously. But I don't know if the rest will go along quite so easily.
You idiot! We have to cover your mess up and that costs us gold... which means you don't get any.
You look like maybe you need a new weapon. Something big, perhaps? An axe maybe? Or a greatsword?
You must be another pilgrim on the way up to High Hrothgar. No other reason to pass through here.
You see, that little Aretino boy was looking for the Dark Brotherhood. For me, and my associates.
You watch the market, you hear the rumors around Riften. What have you heard about these dragons?
You! You hurt my family. I don't like when my family gets hurt. Say you're sorry. Or say goodbye.
You... you disappointed me. You gave too much away. More than was necessary to secure this truce.
You're going with me, and you're going to make sure I don't have any trouble reaching that giant.
You're the one who conspired with the Forsworn against Markarth! You're coming with me, murderer!
...he he he... two threes? What was he thinking? Fool never saw me pull that ace out of my boot...
A few days ago, we were ambushed. A nuisance, really, but many of the marauders had quick fingers.
A few intrepid souls even brought some items back from Morvunskar, the fort southwest of the city.
A lifetime of study, you might say. The best comes from Riften, but I haven't been there in years.
A parade would make you an easy target for a Stormcloak assassin. You're safer here in the palace.
Achh... Thank you, dear. You are most kind. The jester's cut feels as bad as it looks, I'm afraid.
Aduri is what some would call a free spirit. She likes to wander the fall forest for hours on end.
Ah... How my heart soars to look upon a sister Bosmer. Please, how can I serve your hunting needs?
Ah...Here it is. Now, if you'd be so kind as to stand still this will be much easier for me to do.
All right, if you insist. But we'll come running if it sounds like things have gotten out of hand.
All right. Be quick about it, will you? This is a good way for the College to bring in some money.
Allow me to gather the materials I need for my ritual, and then I will meet you outside the ruins.
Although... most of you are already in bed with her! But again... I speak figuratively, of course!
Always thought that old mine had more to it. Just like Mauhulakh to smash his way to good fortune.
Am I responsible if the vintage was off on that case? Sorry, you know the rules Vekel. No refunds.
And once you've had your fill of mead, do us all a favor and go home. Markarth has enough trouble.
And they all see you. You've brought honor to the name of the Companions. We won't soon forget it.
And with that, the tour is over. I thank you for your patronage, and I hope to see you again soon!
Another Overseer will replace Orchendor, when the time comes. For now all is cleansed and ordered.
Any day is a good one, long as I don't have to go into town. But some days, Hjorunn's too drunk...
Are you finished ogling the grotesque? I suppose I should be grateful you didn't simply attack me.
Are you thinking you're better than me? I crawled west out of the wasteland, so show some respect.
Be glad you're here in the city, and not out in Riverwood. Those poor sods don't even have a wall.
Black-Briar Mead is just fine, if you need something to wash the dirt off a riding horse's hooves.
Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth. That's the way it is. That's the way it'll stay.
But I realized that the Mythic Dawn's importance -- our importance -- to history cannot be denied.
But I was going through his things and found a book I had never seen before. All about the Totems.
But my agents report that Galmar is pretty damned convinced Korvanjund is the tomb of King Borgas.
But you don't need to share the worries of an old warrior. This day is to rejoice in your bravery!
But you have indulged my weakness for speech long enough. Krosis. Now I will answer your question.
By the Code of Malacath, you must pay bloodprice for your crimes. Which will it be, blood or gold?
Can't fault anyone for that! As long as you hate the Empire as much as I do, that I can work with.
Can't imagine what he expects to do with that... it's warped beyond any ability to capture a soul.
Careful, there's a pressure plate around here. I've triggered it before and got pelted with darts.
Certainly isn't helping my business any; who'd want to rent a room anywhere near a haunted barrow?
Come on, Tullius, you can't seriously expect us to just hand over Riften at the negotiating table.
Damn! This place is coming down! Quick, get the Skeleton Key and the Eye and lets get out of here!
Did you forget the Oath we took as Nightingales? Did you expect him to simply ignore your methods?
Do not raise arms against my people, and you shall always have a place here, Champion of Malacath.
Do you think me a fool? Do you think I'm too stupid to make the connection? You've ruined my work!
Don't move. Don't move. I have it here, somewhere... never thought it would be any use, but now...
Embers lie nestled in stone, needing only fuel to bloom to a flame that will warm all around them.
Everyone here is having nightmares. I have miners tripping over their own feet from lack of sleep.
Feel free to take what you need from time to time. I'll be refilling it once every few days or so.
First time to Solitude? Beautiful old city. Capital of Skyrim, but I'm sure you already knew that.
Fool. I should thank you. I knew the girl wouldn't be strong enough to help me kill Gathrik alone.
For now, just keep on his tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.
Gray-Mane. Now that's a name fills you with pride. We've got roots in Whiterun. We've got history.
Haven't you heard the stories of Kodlak and Skjor fighting off the hundred-and-one Orc berserkers?
He's kicked me out until I find someone who can settle our disagreement. That's where you come in.
He's outlived his minor usefulness. Take care of him, and then we can leave Cidhna Mine for good. 
Help us, you end up rich. Cross us and you'll end up a memory. Is that enough information for you?
Here, I was saving this for a rainy day. Maybe now I can afford a few more for my people. Take it.
How unfortunate she has to dig through refuse like that. Someone should give her a piece of bread.
However, as promised, I'll still be more than happy to take any stolen merchandise off your hands.
However, if you'd take care of this discreetly, you might be able to surprise him without warning.
I already have the gold band, but all I need are three flawless amethysts to complete the setting.
I am so very sorry. I went over this again and again, and I was sure it would have better results.
I assure you, it is. The knowledge contained in the Lexicon created everything you see around you.
I could crack the lock on any house blindfolded before you even got your picks out of your pocket.
I don't care how many Colleges they build, or how much the sea swallows up. I'll outlast them all.
I doubt the Forsworn would risk holding this mine a second time. They lost many of their warriors.
I expect he'd appreciate some help in locating any additional magical artifacts here in the ruins.
I faced him fearlessly - my fate inescapable, yet my honor is unstained - can Ulfric say the same?
I have no idea what you're talking about. I'd never sleep with anyone besides my good wife, Drifa.
I have no strong love for the Stormcloaks but I can't say I'm all that fond of the Empire, either.
I have some things that belonged to my daughter, Friga. She... she won't be needing them any more.
I heard Elenwen say she's going open a bottle of her best Firebrand Wine later. I can hardly wait.
I heard those Forsworn out west live in caves. Can't be any worse than trying to live in Windhelm.
I just can't be a part of this place any more! The things we do here - evil, evil things. No more!
I killed a lot of High Elves in the Great War, and I didn't die. I guess that makes me a war hero.
I know nothing of fear, and nothing of remorse. Pay my fee, and together we will vanquish any foe.
I know there's a cult that worships him at Haemar's Shame. We should be able to talk to him there.
I might not be as big as some of my fellow Nords, but in a fight they can barely lay a hand on me.
I miss those days, before the Forsworn took up arms again, when you could walk the roads in peace.
I need you to break into Mercer's home and search for anything that could tell us where he's gone.
I once saw Fihada put an arrow in between the eyes of a Blackblood Marauder at five hundred paces.
I only brought it to his attention a few months back when the Synod showed up here looking for it.
I remember you... you were with us at Helgen, and Whiterun. Glad to have you with us. How are you?
I spend so much time among the dead, I sometimes forget how much I miss the company of the living.
I suppose if you're truly interested you could talk to Falk. He's the better-safe-than-sorry type.
I think I like this new mate of my father's. I mean... nothing like that. I just think she's nice.
I was working with Vex and we got inside with no trouble. We found the loot, and made our way out.
I wonder if I could put the dogs to work somehow. But I don't really have the heart to force them.
I wonder why the Dwemer came to Skyrim. Why did they build this place? I suppose we'll never know.
I... I don't know. Ancano is gone, but whatever he's done to the Eye doesn't seem to have stopped.
I'll go after you. Although these fellows know me. I never miss one of Elenwen's parties, you see.
I'll wager it could now forge metal the likes of which hasn't been seen since eras long forgotten.
I'm afraid there's a problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.
I'm always happy to see a customer, but I won't deal in stolen goods. That's trouble I don't need.
I'm no scholar, but I know that a lot of battles have been fought here over the course of history.
I'm not stealing anything. Besides, some jail time isn't going to make me roll over and play dead.
I'm not sure how many men they have inside, but I trust that won't be an issue for you. Good luck.
I'm sure it will wear off soon. When it does, you'll be perfectly fine, and then we can try again.
I'm trying something new, offering discounts for bulk purchases. So far, that seems to be working.
I've already lost a family, and we're about to start a new one. I don't want that to happen again.
Idiot! That wasn't the deal. You were just supposed to teach them a lesson. I am not paying you...
If he returns it to you it means we have business to settle. If he keeps it, then we are at peace.
If I wanted to hear a tall tale, I'll read a children's storybook. Get some better stories, Vipir.
If it's true, and you do have the Voice, would you mind showing me? I've never seen it first-hand.
If we'd all died there, if we'd loosed the thing on the world, who knows what might have happened?
If you need me, I'd be honored to accompany you, Guardian of the Star. It would give me a purpose.
If you think you might be able to do that kind of thing, the Legion could certainly use your help.
Iron and steel mostly. I might even have some of your fancy Elven pieces lying around somewhere...
It is my hope that I will one day return to Hjaalmarch. But the Divines have not shown this to me.
It is our way, and I am proud to follow my people's traditions, but I can't help but feel chained.
It is. These aren't particularly glamorous assassinations, I'll be honest. Don't pay much, either.
It took me weeks to find that thieves' den. I can't stop now, and I can't get the sword on my own.
It took me weeks, but I finally tracked down the killer. A bloody Altmer at that. Can you imagine?
It was Mara that first gave birth to all of creation and pledged to watch over us as her children.
It's a miracle these Stormcloaks haven't robbed us blind yet. I'm sure it's only a matter of time.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you. Let me open the gate and you can head into the city.
It's going very well, actually. The war hasn't even slowed down our production or shipping at all.
It's hardly a secret that they have ties to the Empire, and hate anyone who speaks out against it.
It's immoral to worship a man. And it's also illegal. A faithful Imperial citizen would know that.
It's my desire to enter the Bards College. My parents are hesitant, but I pray they let me attend.
It's my pleasure. If you see the Thieves Guild harassing anyone else, you be sure and let me know.
It's not easy running messages, what with Imperials scouts crawling all over the place. Well done.
It's only a matter of time before your whole rotten Empire collapses of its own decay. No offense.
Jarl Black-Briar put your government together. Do it now, or there will be rioting in the streets.
Just got a tip on this house... should be stuffed with loot. Care to head over there and find out?
Kill these two, and I'll have one last contract to give you. I'm just finalizing some details now.
Lady Maven's been developing the secret recipe for Black-Briar Mead over the last several decades.
Let's be honest, here. I don't always think my decisions through.  But you... you're going places.
Let's not kid ourselves. Black-Briar Mead is swill. The only thing keeping it successful is Maven.
Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can. Help yourself to whatever you need, within reason.
Likewise, the College of Whispers has long been driven by its desire to directly oppose the Synod.
Listen to your friend, Fruki. They are just dreams, my dear. I assure you that it is quite normal.
Look, you want it, I got it. You know the price, so talk to me when you want to cough up the gold.
Lorkhan's eyes, do I have to do everything myself? Get back to Riften before the Thalmor find him!
M'aiq does not understand what is so impressive about shouting. M'aiq can shout whenever he wants.
Master! You've taken me back! Does this mean we're going home? Oh, happy times! I can't wait to...
Maven Black-Briar, the matriarch of the family, represents everything that's wrong with this city.
May you all be as happy in your lives as I know I will be in mine. Thank you again for everything.
Mercenaries. Warriors of honor. Brothers and sisters of the blade. Drunken rabble. Take your pick.
Mirabelle does a fine job as Master Wizard, I suppose. Still, there's always room for improvement.
Mmm, sorry. I really can't risk it. I'm sure you can find someone else with a little less dignity.
My advice? Always be honest with the old man, but don't tell him anything he doesn't need to know.
My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I don't think I can take him by myself.
My intention was to spend the rest of my years here, burying the past and praying for forgiveness.
My scouts tell me the inns at Dragonbridge and Rorikstead are frequent stops for Imperial runners.
New to Skyrim? I was confused at first, too. The Nords call their mausoleums the Hall of the Dead.
Next, I need a little investigating to confirm the possibility of blackmailing the Jarl's Steward.
No disrespect toward the general, but sometimes I wonder if he's got your best interests at heart.
No there isn't. And I suggest you leave it at that. I don't want to see anyone get hurt over this.
No, I'm sorry. You must have me mistaken for someone else. I've never even heard that name before.
No? Well, then she hasn't gotten to you yet. But she will. And you don't you believe a word of it.
Now if there are no more questions, how about following me and I'll show you what we're all about.
Now it's up to me to save him one more time... this time from the executioner's block in Solitude.
Now what am I supposed to do? I can't be seen in public like this. If I can even be seen at all...
Now, I know what you're thinking - this is no spoon, it's a fork! Nobody can eat soup with a fork!
Now, mysteriously, some sort of anonymous adversary shows up and takes the Estate out of my hands.
Oddly enough, Spriggans. Usually they let alone, but for some reason, this particular grove isn't.
Of course you can buy me a drink... you didn't need to say a word, but I heard you loud and clear.
Oh, and if you meet Maven Black-Briar, stay on her good side. This is her city, and nobody else's.
Oh, goodness me. You're a friend of Gabriella's, then. Well, I guess we both know why you're here.
Oh, I've heard this one before. Watch out Divines, poor Kodrir curses you all for giving him life!
Oh! There's no need for that. I know why you're here. Tell Brynjolf not to worry about it anymore.
One of their ceremonies involved the Pilgrim's Path, a so called [QUOTE]test of worthiness.[QUOTE]
Perhaps the Stormcloaks will soon lose heart for this little rebellion of theirs once and for all.
Please, help Avulstein if you can. Something has to be done, or we're all going to lose our minds.
Quite amazing, yes. Alchemy and the blessings of a Divine distilled down into a ingestible liquid.
Raiding all along the coast, from Hammerfell to Vvardenfell. Only the Shatter-Shields appear safe.
Ranmir has no problem drinking himself under the table, so I have to be the one to make ends meet.
Return it here, to the Tiid-Ahraan. Then... Kelle vomindok. Nothing is certain with such things...
Return to my figure on Mount Kilkreath, and I shall make you the instrument of my cleansing light.
Right here! I see it in your face! The snakes writhe behind your eyes! Get away, get away from me!
Right, right... Oh, look at that. I seem to have lost my keys. Might take me a while to find them.
She's a friend. Saved my life in fact. Come on, I'll explain everything, but we need to go inside.
She's already come down hard on us for missing shipments. Likely to do it again, since we're late.
She's just worried about you. We all are. We just want you to be happy. We want to make you happy.
Sir, I think we all understand that fairly well. We wouldn't be here if we couldn't control magic!
So you're telling me you and Sam just sent me in there to die, then? I want my money, you bastard.
So, if you've got the nerve, I've got plenty of extra jobs to help get the Guild back on its feet.
So... once again the Key has been stolen and a [QUOTE]champion[QUOTE] returns it to the Sepulcher.
Some of us refused to bow. We knew the old ways would lead us back to having a kingdom of our own.
Someday the College may be fully accepted by the Nords. I hope that my work as Arch-Mage may help.
Sometimes they even look up. What do they see then? What if they dive in? Then the madness begins.
Speak with Nazir and see if he has any contracts available. I need time to read Motierre's letter.
Still, I'm surprised you haven't heard of Ulfric. He's our leader - the leader of the Stormcloaks.
Stormcloak scouts are making it difficult to move around. It's good you made it here in one piece.
Taking his city and leaving him in disgrace would make a more powerful statement, don't you think?
Talos mastered the power of the Voice, and with it he united the lands of men into a great Empire.
Thank you! Here... I stole a lot from the Thalmor over the years. You may as well have some of it.
Thank you. Your Shield-Siblings have withdrawn to the Underforge. I think they're waiting for you.
That's about the only harmless thing you can do in this city. Silver-Blood Inn is the place to go.
That's it. That's it! I don't know who you are, but you may have just saved this little project...
The choice was clear. And now, Ulfric threatens the thinly veiled peace we sacrificed so much for.
The College is a bit of an oddity in Skyrim. Magic isn't something that's looked upon fondly here.
The Empire has no place in Skyrim... not any more. And you? You have no place in Whiterun anymore.
The Flagon was once a city beneath a city. We had our own smith, our own alchemist... you name it.
The Gentle Repose is barren, it was barren the day my father claimed the land and it's barren now.
The Mortar and Pestle makes potions, if you can't tell from the name. Just step up to the counter.
The prophecy which brought the Akaviri to Tamriel in the first place, in search of the Dragonborn.
The Razor is Mehrunes Dagon's personal artifact. It has always heralded bloody change and carnage.
The Star is free to purify itself. Don't worry, mortal. I will return you before you are cleansed.
Then perhaps you care to explain why you are standing so close a dead body with your weapon drawn?
There was some bother about a group of mages being exiled. I can't remember what the details were.
There's a smart lass. Check the map. The loot's hidden there. It'll show itself when you get near.
There's an entrance to it in the basement storeroom of the warehouse that used to be boarded over.
They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else.
This Elder Scroll might be able to show you the past in some way, then... yes, yes, it could work.
This has been going on for years. And all I've been able to find is murder and blood. I need help.
This key opens one of my drop spots in the basement of the meadery. Take anything inside you like.
Too often the general has lost good soldiers because he did not take Ulfric and his men seriously.
Umm... You dropped a piece armor over there. I was kind of hoping that I could, you know, have it?
Until a few months ago, the girl was head over heels for Klimmek. Wouldn't stop talking about him.
Vomindok. I do not know. Perhaps in the very doing they erased the knowing of it from Time itself.
We just got a cask of Old Gold 200 that has a crack in it. Better serve it now before it goes bad.
We'll look the other way this time, but even the Jarl's influence has its limits. Be more careful.
We're not going in there until the Jarl's men come to clear them out, so I wouldn't go down there.
Well then, look. Look all you want. And when you're done looking, maybe we can get some work done.
What a fascinating time to be alive! Mark me, these days will be remembered long after we're gone.
What are you still doing here? The Jarl said retrieving that stone tablet is a priority. Remember?
What do I pay you for, to stand around all day? You're supposed to be bringing goods to the store.
What else could we do? Stay there and die with her? She refused to go on, we didn't have a choice!
What made you think I was to blame in the first place? I've actually been after the killer myself.
Whatever it is, it will have to wait until after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation.
When I heard what Sibbi did, I fled. Now you've found me, and you're going to tell him where I am.
When Linwe moved into the area, he contacted me and said if I didn't fence for them, he'd kill me.
Who can say? Perhaps she collects them for display like works of art in a nonsensical art gallery.
Why don't you take a look at some of my merchandise and we'll see what kind of a deal we can make.
Why, because I'm a proud citizen of the Empire? Because the Stormcloaks only want Nords in Skyrim?
With the rumors going around about how poorly your Guild's been doing, she's become much too bold.
Yes, a blessing. For many months we have sought your guidance, yet we have heard nothing from you.
Yes. You're right. If they needed to die so that Dawnstar could live, then it was worth the price.
You could if I had one. Sold my last available horse to someone that looked an awful lot like you.
You don't deserve to call yourself an Orc! You're weak, you're small, and you're an embarrassment!
You don't have to say anything. There's no need. You're here, so I know you'll accept my contract.
You found it? I've been looking for that blade for months. You took on all those bandits yourself?
You know who I am? You attacked one of my clan. I've come to accept your apology... or your death.
You know, I was thinking of expanding the herb garden. Make room for some new plants I'm planning.
You left this over there. You're lucky - someone else might have kept it for himself. Here you go.
You must be new around here, or you'd know they don't let my kind live anywhere outside that slum.
You should talk to Ainethach if you have business with the mine. Not that there's much these days.
You should tell her that her uncle is scum that betrayed his High King. Best she know now, Addvar.
You still bear a head of the Glenmoril betrayers, yes? Then lead on, back to the Tomb of Ysgramor.
You there! As an officer of the Imperial Legion, I require your assistance to complete my mission.
You're here! And not a moment too soon. If anything should happen to Arn, there'll be hell to pay.
You've already purchased every available improvement. I'm afraid I have nothing else to offer you.
A bad dream I can handle, but everyone having the same bad dream, every night? It's a curse, I say.
A couple of years? I wasn't a Forsworn when I came, but I joined up when I got in. Easier that way.
A great many things obscured to you are quite clear to us. We have long believed you would prevail.
A new chapter in the Thieves Guild is being written this day and we all owe it to you. Many thanks.
A true professional would have kept his cool and dealt with it a different way, but I'll let it go.
Ah Potema. Former queen of Solitude and one of the most dangerous necromancers in recorded history.
Ah yes, Adonato's new work. Shorter than I expected, but words must be judged on merit, not length.
Ah, an excellent question. Mehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Lord of Change, Destruction, and Ambition.
And now I've found the answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and only their magic can release us.
And of course, they'll be caught off guard thinking we're off doing something altogether different.
Before you even ask, yes I have an ancestry steeped in magic, and no I don't want to talk about it.
Best of all, you don't have to pay the ridiculous prices Maven charges. So what do you say to that?
But instead, I wish to offer my services to you. If you ever wish to journey with me, I'll be here.
But make no mistake. I am the leader of this Sanctuary. My word is law. Are we clear on that point?
Can you believe that fetcher had more than tripled the guard? There must be eight of them in there.
Captain Kjar expects the best, but he's a fair man. He never fails to reward hard work and loyalty.
Chin up, Brand-Shei. Lady Mara will provide us strength and guidance through these difficult times.
Dagur's been talking at you, hasn't he? Gotten you roped into his little plan to fix Ranmir's life?
Did she appeal to your sense of honor? Your greed? A more... base need, perhaps? It doesn't matter.
Did you say an [QUOTE]elf[QUOTE] and [QUOTE]stars[QUOTE]? I hope you don't know what you're asking.
Do you like horses? You  should visit the stables. I own them, you see. And our stock is excellent.
Do you remember what I first told you, about how not being able to control magic could destroy you?
Do you think you're strong enough for Kyne's blessing? I would be glad to pass this tradition down.
Don't worry about it. Maven's business dealings usually involve quite a bit of gold for her people.
Eight septims for breaking your back, and then you live in squalor. How much is your dignity worth?
Eorlund and I... we both miss our son terribly. Thorald... he went missing, fighting the Imperials.
Events in the last several hundred years resulted in a significant loss of our history, I'm afraid.
Everyone who's anyone. Viarmo bought an apple the other day, said he was looking for a new student.
Finally, the Nords took over around Tiber Septim's time. That bent a few folks' arms the wrong way.
For centuries, we have benefited from the Empire's protection, and prosperous trade with the south.
For some reason they just throw their lawbreakers out into the sea and think that ends the problem.
Give me a moment while I make a few, um, [QUOTE]corrections[QUOTE] to these reports... There we go.
Go and see for yourself. Zu'u ni bo nol het. I will be here... unless Alduin returns before you do.
Got a loving wife, a healthy son and a patch of land to call my own. What more could a man ask for?
He seemed a fool to me, but if he's right, the honor of the Companions demands that we seek it out.
He speaks to us only rarely, and never to outsiders. Being allowed to see him is a great privilege.
He's an accomplished wizard. And, locating him may be challenging, as he travels with the caravans.
Here you go. Tell Hafjorg that she can chip off whatever she thinks is a fair trade for their time.
Here, take this. I certainly can't use it, but I suppose I need to pay you something for the goods.
Hey, haven't I seen you around the Flagon? I never expected to see another Guild brother down here.
Hey, I still have a contact in Valenwood that may have some work for us. You're welcome to join me.
His name was Torsten Cruel-Sea. He was really rich, 'cause he owned a whole farm called Hollyfrost.
Hmm... Your creature doesn't appear to be fairing any better than before. Methinks your aim is off.
Hmph. Look at you. So calm. So confident. I do believe you were born for this task. So let's begin.
Hmph. You wear that armor well. Iron may be simple, but it'll stop enough to keep you in the fight.
How come you're in Winterhold? My pa says people like you are the reason no one lives here anymore.
How you get it from them is up to you. Nobody would notice if Farengar went missing, I promise you.
Hurt him. I mean her. Whichever. No killing though. And I ain't paying your fine if you get caught.
I also suggest you spend some time in the trainin' room. Just talk to Vipir. He'll show you around.
I am the spirit of the hunt, just one glimpse of the glorious stalker that your kind calls Hircine.
I asked the question because I was hoping you might be able to help me recover something I've lost.
I came home to Skyrim when it was all over. But I wasn't much good at anything other than fighting.
I can't believe how lucky we got landing this job. It's a far cry from working for the Stormcloaks.
I can't stand them, they represent everything I hate about Skyrim. They're tearing the place apart!
I can't thank you enough, friend. I'll hope you'll come back to Rorikstead soon and pay me a visit.
I don't really know anyone at the College. I guess everyone just assumes I do because I'm a Dunmer.
I ended up in Skyrim thanks to a contact I'd made when I was with the Crescents... good old Delvin.
I found the ring's resting place after he died, but I'm far too old to go exploring some cave, now.
I had a bad time a few years back, an' I turned to drink. But Vignar, he wouldn't let me stay weak.
I hope to open my own stables one day, but I think it's going to take a lot longer than I expected.
I just try and do my job, and not to think about what's happened. Try to find what happiness I can.
I know they laughed when I said I wanted to keep the mine open. I'll show them. I'll show them all.
I performed the Black Sacrament, contacted you people, because I thought you guaranteed discretion.
I remember you, you were at Helgen. Speak to Legate Rikke. I suspect we could use someone like you.
I see. Well, make it quick, or do you have better things to do than fight for the people of Skyrim?
I seem to have an unfortunate talent for getting myself involved in misunderstandings with the law.
I serve my chief and my brothers by working in the mines. It's the only place fit for an aging Orc.
I set up the whole deal. A courier was supposed to be bringing it from Morrowind. He never arrived.
I should say so. I'd be careful in the future before you confront someone without all of the facts!
I still think my boy should have had a traditional Nord wedding. Outside, in the cool mountain air.
I try to do my little part. Besides, just between you and me, it's making me pots of money, hahaha.
I understand. I'm sorry. I just get so excited thinking about it. So... can we. Do some fire magic?
I used to run with them myself, but took a job with Maven after they started hittin' a rough patch.
I'll gladly share a portion of the bounty in return for your efforts in seeing proper justice done.
I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can successfully use it to block spells, all right?
I'm disappointed in you brother. You had it all. You had it all and your mouth cost you everything.
I'm here because it's required of me. But there's nothing to be gained by talking to that murderer.
I'm sort of hoping you're going to fight the dragons for us. A normal man is no match for a dragon.
I'm sure it's hard to believe, but I was once a bold adventurer like you, ready to face any danger.
I've got enough to worry about, taking care of my family. I don't concern myself with such matters.
If my analysis is correct, the dragon buried near Kynesgrove will be the next to come back to life.
If there's one thing I hate more than a mean-spirited drunk, it's one who can't settle their debts.
If there's still a Legion left, Adara. I'm sure you'd make a great soldier. Just like your brother.
If this works out, I'll make sure you're rewarded. Just don't trust any offer he makes you... okay?
If you're looking for anything to sell for a fair price, I run the Pawned Prawn over by the market.
Increased his intelligence and knowledge in ways unfathomable to us? We may never know for certain.
Is something wrong. [QUOTE]Is something wrong?[QUOTE] he asks. Yes, something is bloody well wrong!
It was on a job a few years back... it was supposed to be a simple burglary on a house in Windhelm.
It... It's very valuable. Critical to my work, and one-of-a-kind. That's all I care to say for now.
It's just me and my mother at the mill here. My father is gone. We don't know what happened to him.
It's said that the Forsworn make dark pacts with the Hagravens, and that is why they can use magic.
It's the prophecy, don't you see? Only a Dragonborn can stop Alduin and avert the end of the world!
Joric's sister? Poor child. Magic runs deep in that family's bloodline. It's not always a blessing.
Just bring any of them, lad! Can't risk thirsty customers without mead to drink, even for a second!
Just get the notes and bring them to me. If you can't do it, I'll find some other way to manage it.
M'aiq can travel fast across the land. Some lazy types take carriages. It is all the same to M'aiq.
Make sure the back fence is repaired. I swear I saw some skeevers in nibbling the leaves yesterday.
Malyn's enchantments are broken. Hold on. I'm going to pull your soul out of there. Brace yourself.
More coin means more supplies, and that means more useful balms, potions and remedies for everyone.
Most scholars believe that the Nords of old used these implements to prepare their dead for burial.
My niece Svana helps me with the chores. She'd be more help if she kept her head out of the clouds.
My wife, Indara, has a gift with animals.  It makes her a better farmer than anyone I've ever seen.
No but my husband Torygg would want a proper burial and this is the way Nords are buried in Skyrim.
No objections, then? Good. Go now. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.
Nothing, nothing. Just straighten yourself out before you find yourself headed back to Black Marsh.
Now here I am, working for this dreary city's Fishery. I sometimes wonder why I don't just move on.
Now I'm sitting in here counting skeever droppings while he's drinking Black-Briar mead with Maven.
Now if I thought she was really in love with Bassianus, that would be one thing. But she's a child.
Now that we have Winterhold, I can garrison some troops there until I'm ready to march on Windhelm.
Now, while I'm certain this is all terribly interesting to you, I have important matters to attend.
Of course it is. That's what happens when you're partners with a corrupt Imperial whore like Maven.
Oh really? Well you can tell them that I will be putting in a request for a few dresses quite soon.
Oh, be quiet you great lumbering lapdog. The man has had a long journey. You can at least be civil.
Oh, he was young, and handsome. I had half a mind to go after him, myself, before I met my husband.
Oh, no need to be shy! My day is your day! Please - eat, drink, make merry! We're all friends here!
Oh, no. But being surrounded by good music, good drink and good friends is all I've ever asked for.
Oh, of course! Because Malacath would take pity on us if only a useless outsider would lend a hand.
Oh, well... I suppose that's a noble cause. I'll settle this bill at the end of the day. Thank you.
One of Clavicus's little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshiped Hircine.
Perhaps it's actually a sign of their love for you. They don't want to see you with unworthy mates.
Petty thieving, huh? Just like poor Grisvar. Hopefully you'll learn your lesson faster than he has.
Please. You're in the presence of a born huntsman. I can hear the sweat sliding down your forehead.
Pull the chain over there, and watch out for the spikes. Looks like Karliah reset all of the traps.
Sailors are what happened to them. They got drunk and ended up losing the merchandise in some cave.
Saraan uth - I await your command, as promised. Are you ready to see the world as only a dovah can?
See if you can find some, and I'll try to find some more interesting work by the time you get back.
Sentinel? That's in Hammerfell, correct? And you say these bracelets are only worn by the nobility?
Shirking the law in Windhelm ain't what it used to be. Not with the Thieves Guild running things...
Shor's Stone - pissant little town, not even an inn. Just a bunch of miners scratching in the dirt.
Silence. You know the rules. Do not speak unless spoken to. Master Rulindil will ask the questions.
So I've let him run his little Forsworn rebellion from inside Cidhna Mine. Now he's out of control.
Sorry, my lady. I've been looking but I'm convinced Saerlund says truly believes what he is saying.
Steward, I have an idea that might help to bolster the morale of our people in this difficult time.
Take care if you're venturing too far from town. That's a bitter wind coming off the Sea of Ghosts.
Take this payment - the Jarl would thank you but she very much wants to keep Potema's return quiet.
Talos is part of our culture. He's part of our heritage and our tradition. He's Skyrim personified.
Thank you so much. Here. Let me show you a thing or two about not attracting attention to yourself.
Thankfully, Jarl Elisif cares far less about your lost profits than she does about winning the war!
That may be true, but I ordered Irileth to bring back proof. You'd best report back to her at once.
That sounds good. I'm not sure the court will believe that Olaf had wizard powers but we shall see.
That's the trouble. I know Faleen from the Keep, but I have no idea what sorts of things she likes.
The anticipation is killing me. Can you figure out who has the contract? Which one will you choose?
The Balmora Blue is locked in a chest under the docks near the Red Wave. Hope you like getting wet.
The flame of my master burns low. Without him, we are all lost and forever gray... Please, help us!
The lute they stole is Finn's original eight course lute. I doubt they even realize its true value.
The men training here in Solitude and the troops out in the field, they all need weapons and armor.
The Psijics have no connection to these ruins. And no one's seen any of their order in a long time.
The Reach has been part of Skyrim for a thousand years, but the Reachmen still haven't accepted it.
The Silver-Bloods have made you a very generous offer for this pile of dirt. I suggest you take it.
There's Deekus, a shipwreck scavenger. Ma'randru-jo, a traveling caravaner. And Anoriath, a hunter.
There's nothing a man can do that I can't do better, whether it's serving drinks or slaying trolls.
There's someone that wants to see him put out of business permanently. That's all you need to know.
They were a group of mages with a history that pre-dates the Empire. Very powerful, very secretive.
This is my final contract, and certainly the most challenging. Be careful with this one, my friend.
This is Nightingale Hall. You're the first of the uninitiated to set foot inside in over a century.
This is Stormcloak territory. If you're one of those craven Imperials, don't expect a warm welcome.
This one time only, I'll grant you special immunity for any past transgressions, real or perceived.
This truce with the Stormcloaks won't last a fortnight. Bloody savages will kill us while we sleep.
This war has taken a toll on the merchants of Skyrim. Let's hope that it ends soon, for their sake.
Those who overthrew him in ancient times only postponed the day of reckoning, they did not stop it.
Three in fact. They're my own recipe. Brought them over here from my days as a bartender in Gideon.
To even begin to inscribe them, I need something very special. A sigil stone from an Oblivion gate.
To read an Elder Scroll, a person must have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness.
Unlike some folks here in town, we have nothing against the College or the people that come and go.
Used to be the Dark Brotherhood was bound by Five Tenets, but we stopped following those years ago.
We accept the risks that come with our faith, but I'll keep your offer in mind. Thank you, Niranye.
We can't take another villager from the surface so soon. I told you to prepare everything properly!
We only want what is best for Tamriel. Surely, the rebels will accept peace when they realize this.
We will soon begin publicly executing captured men. That should send a clear message to the people.
We're doomed. The mine is going to stay closed, and we'll up be carted of to Cidhna Mine as slaves.
Welcome to Warmaiden's. Now don't let the name worry you - we got plenty o' steel for fightin' men.
Well, I'm not blind to the fact that you've been instrumental in improving my affairs of the heart.
Well, if he wants to stand outside the protection of the Empire, fine. Let Ulfric pillage his city.
Well, we have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation, so don't get sentimental on me now.
Well... we could use some breathing space to regroup. Things haven't been going well for us lately.
What is more, I'm away from the hold at a time when there are dragons and Stormcloaks on the loose.
When I heard Cicero screaming, I knew you'd been discovered. I feared the worst. Are you all right?
Whiterun's walls are tall, but they are old and crumbling, like the Empire whose Legion lines them.
With father I said goodbye... with mother I said goodbye. Reyda leaves and Narfi can't say goodbye.
With the heart of one of their Briar Warriors, I can lock the Phial's magic into its physical form.
Working hard gives a man reason for drinking hard! Well, that and putting up with a wife like mine.
Yes, and I sent it with our fastest courier and under the cover of night, exactly as you specified.
Yes, but I must stay here and wait for the day when I'll be married and sent to another stronghold.
Yes. With Markarth in our hands, we'll be able to raid the Imperial supply lines out of Solitude...
You can make your own potions by mixing up to three ingredients together. Just use the Alchemy Lab.
You can tell Jarl Igmund that the Silver-Blood family won't tolerate his cowardice for much longer.
You could say the Ratway is the city under the city. Dark, dangerous, and no place for decent folk.
You found it? Ha ha ha. There it is. Strange... it seems smaller than I remember. Funny thing, huh?
You have much to learn... But you have proven your will is strong and your heart is devoid of pity.
You persist? Fine. You go tell Malacath to lift this curse from me. See how well he listens to you.
You should come hear me play at the Sleeping Giant Inn. For a small sum you can even pick the song.
You sure about that? You want to let that dragon loose after all the trouble to catch him in there?
You've disgraced yourself and our cause. You are no longer fit to be known as a daughter of Skyrim.
You've never had a taste of sweet Honningbrew? Why, it's only the finest mead outside of Sovngarde!
After you, Dragonborn. You should have the honor of being the first to set foot in Sky Haven Temple.
Ah, good to see you, sister. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed.
All that remains then is the exterior gate. Find a way through to open it and the city will be ours!
And after you told me that sweet story of how you met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why he left you.
And now, I present to you, Ulfric Stormcloak, hero of the people, liberator and High King of Skyrim!
And with the pup back, I'll be restored to my full power. There's a whole world just waiting for me!
As promised, here's the key to the Dwemer Museum. Mind the displays. Some of them are quite fragile.
At first I thought I'd miss farming. I guess I've had my fill of it, because I don't miss it at all.
Aye, they're an old clan like ours, but they cast their lot with the Empire when the uprising began.
Balgruuf and I share a battle bond. We met as youths, and forged our friendship in the fires of war.
Best you forget whatever you think you saw, elf. Such idle talk can prove hazardous to one's health.
Better than ever. With the Guild back on its feet, there's more coin to throw around. How about you?
Better to stay out of sight and ply my trade with the Thieves Guild than risk a contract on my head.
Break the law here in Markarth, and maybe we can work something out. Courtesy of the Thieves Guild. 
But first, inform Nazir of your plans. For you are the Listener, and must bind this Family together.
But I forget myself. Krosis. So los mid fahdon. Melancholy is an easy trap for a dovah to fall into.
But I'm sure those Skyrim dogs would stand down if the keepers of the tales showed their patriotism!
But she is as volatile as a sabre cat. One wrong word, and I've seen her turn on a man so quickly...
But then Olfrid got rich an' decided he an his kin were too good for us simple, backwards Nord folk.
But we don't get any shipments in. Forsworn attack every caravan. So all I do is sit here and drink.
Careful here, there's a trick to this. Trick is to not bleed to death. Ah, and there's a lever, too.
Come on in. Let me know if you need anything, or take a seat by the fire and I'll send someone over.
Come on, now! I want those arrows dead center! The lives of your fellow soldiers are counting on it.
Comes down to trust, I expect. After Dengeir gave up his seat to his nephew, he didn't trust anyone.
Do you feel it? Magic. Deep and ancient. It resonates from the College, like the beating of a heart.
Do you really think Ulfric will just turn Riften over because some Imperial general barked an order?
Don't know why you're asking me. But I'm glad that damn Imperial is gone. Something wrong about him.
Don't worry about those Stormcloaks. You're safe from them here. As if they'd want the place anyway.
Dragging people off in the middle of the night... one of the main causes of this war, if you ask me.
Everyone stay back. The Markarth city guard have this all under control. There are no Forsworn here.
Excellent. Looks like you've really driven them into hiding. Keep this up. We'll wipe them out, yet.
Expecting free information, eh? Help me deal with business first, then we'll see how I can help you.
First of all, I'd like to drum up some more support from the local populace. I have someone in mind.
For a modest fee, I'll bring my formidable arcane powers to bear against your foes. What do you say?
Forget about Hroggar. He's always so tired lately. I need someone with a little fire in their blood.
Give this document to Vald. It frees him from the debt, but I never want to see him in Riften again.
Go now. I have seen the threads of your fate in the Twilight, and you still have much to accomplish.
Gods, I'd hate to lose my footing in a place like this. A fall on this stony floor will break bones.
Good, that must be very comfortable for you. I think mine's a bit too small. Perhaps we could trade?
Ha ha. If it was like that she wouldn't be asking for you, she'd be calling on the Dark Brotherhood.
Hail, Nightingale! Luck has shined down on me and made me a rich man. Here is your cut, as promised.
Has the Empire forsaken us? How could Whiterun fall into the hands of these stinking half-wit Nords?
Have you not heard of me? Perhaps I will have my people carve my name in your corpse, as a reminder.
He lives somewhere in the Ratway Warrens. Must be crazy or desperate to live down there. Maybe both.
He was a brilliant student, an accomplished wizard. Delved into magic in a way none had seen before.
He's a hapless beggar living in some ruins just outside the village of Ivarstead. Easy even for you.
Head north to Winterhold. There's a College there, they teach magic. Most Nords don't care for them.
Hello, husband. You're rising late. You spent too long at the Sleeping Giant last night, didn't you?
Hey, people have paid money for stranger things. Take our cow dung - we sell that by the wagon load.
How did... no, forget it. I don't care to know. I'm free of the little man, and that's what matters.
I am the Jarl of Markarth, now. The Silver-Blood family is finally where it should have always been.
I asked Falion if someday I could learn from the mages in Winterhold, but he doesn't like that idea.
I desired stealth and secrecy, but you executed the task with as much subtlety as a enrage mammoth. 
I don't deal in land or property. Now, if you're looking for goods, you've come to the right person.
I fear for you and your husband, should the Thamlor come here. But perhaps there's a way I can help.
I give you my ring. Wear it, and when you feast on the flesh of the dead, I will grant you my power.
I guess you don't have potatoes in your ears after all. Just make sure we get a fresh batch in soon.
I have a buyer with, shall we say, a very odd taste in literature looking for some particular books.
I inherited the ship when my mother passed away. She spent her life on the water, and now I do, too.
I just hate to see what's happened to him. He hasn't always been like this, you know. Drunk, I mean.
I just want to be left alone to do my job, and to enjoy what little free time I have when I have it.
I knew it. Everyone comes in here, expecting my help, but they don't even have the proper questions.
I know that he still worships Talos. That he hates the Thalmor almost as much as the Stormcloaks do.
I know those lowlifes took it with them back to the Ratway. They left an unmistakable stench behind.
I know, I know, how could I lie to you? Well, how could I trust you until we've shared a few drinks?
I must return my attention to Elisif. If were were to lose another Jarl while I was... distracted...
I never asked you to help in the first place. Why would I? Everyone in Skyrim only helps themselves.
I refuse to believe Alva had anything to do with this. There is no way you can prove it to the Jarl.
I swear, is there no end to these uncouth savages, just throwing their trash wherever they please...
I think by now I've killed one of every living thing in Skyrim. May be time for a trip to Morrowind.
I was lucky. If you hadn't rescued me, I'd probably be a thief, a mercenary or something even worse.
I wish I could believe that I'd have held out forever against their torture, but I can't be so sure.
I wish I could head to one of the capital cities... maybe even back to Mournhold. Anywhere but here.
I wish I could help you, but I've been a prisoner in this very chamber for the last quarter century.
I... I'm so sorry, Torbjorn. You must be suffering terribly. I wish there was some way I could help.
I'm a bard, from the Bards College here in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying.
I'm disappointed in your failure. But the Empire still needs you. I'll have to over look it for now.
I'm kneeling here with my hands bound and a sack over my head, and you have the gall to ask me that?
I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there are several Khajiit Caravans that travel across the realm.
I'm proud to be your battle-brother, Dragonborn. Whiterun doesn't need to fear with you on our side.
I'm sorry, you're going to have to leave. Tell Brynjolf he'll just have to make due without my coin.
I've learned to trust her lead at this point. After all, we Nightingales need to stick together, eh?
If I said that was a tedious question, would you be smart enough to know what I meant? Probably not.
If it wasn't for Aerin, the young man who saved my life, I think I'd already have given up long ago.
If only this parchment had the buyer's name instead of this odd symbol. Any idea what that might be?
If Riften is the best Skyrim has to offer, I may as well turn back right now and just head for home.
If the Circle vouches for you, I'm sworn to respect their judgment. But that doesn't mean I like it.
If Ulfric had asked Torygg directly to stand up, to declare independence, Torygg might have done it.
If you really are Dragonborn, then Skyrim needs you. Go to High Hrothgar and talk to the Greybeards.
If you're heading up to Solitude you should stop to check out the view on your way. It's a good one.
Immensely powerful mage, back in the First Era. Had an understanding of magic few have ever matched.
In any case he won't be turnin' me into no Imperial soldier. I know my place, and it's at your side.
In these grave times each Legionnaire must be his better self at all times and under all conditions.
Is something wrong. [QUOTE]Is something wrong?[QUOTE] she asks. Yes, something is bloody well wrong!
It certainly seems that whoever placed this here intended for it to be well guarded. I wonder why...
It was Talos that helped us win back the city. I'm as sure of that as the sun rising in the morning.
It's always been said that the souls of the heroes of old are what give Skyforge steel its strength.
It's an entirely different situation. I don't expect you to comprehend the nuances of these matters.
It's full of spiders, that's what's wrong with it! Almost killed Grogmar and me when they showed up.
It's not that simple. Ulfric wants a Skyrim for the Nords. He doesn't trust what he calls outsiders.
Jarl's been looking for someone who ain't superstitious though. Be lookin' for a fool if you ask me.
Just be careful, Gralnach. That copse doesn't look safe. If you see any trouble, you run right home.
Just cause some pain. I don't want a death on my conscience. If you get caught, it's not my problem.
Just head right back to the Guild and get the information to Mercer. Nothing else is more important.
Just what we need. City folk barging in, probably looking for an offering to their precious Divines.
Just wondering when you'll be ready to give it up and settle down. Seems like you're always working.
Just... Just bring me some Dwemer cogs. I need to examine them for the methods used in forging them.
Killing him secretly will certainly make things easier on you, but if there are witnesses, so be it.
Kyne's guardian troll awaits you. Complete this trial and you'll have proven yourself a true hunter.
Look, come back tomorrow, okay? If I have anything left that's not sold or spoiled, you can have it.
Look, he says we needed coin, so I got coin. Who cares if people got hurt? Blood washes off septims.
Looks like we're the only ones who made it. Was that really a dragon? The bringers of the End Times?
Lucky for us, that the wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now. Just up the road!
Magic? You're on the wrong side of Skyrim. You want Winterhold... that College there. They teach it.
Make your way to Northwatch Keep in Haafingar. I'll meet you near there, and we'll plan our assault.
Mara this and Mara that. Where is she when hundreds of Stormcloaks are dying for no good reason, eh?
Maul? Yeah. That jerk works for Maven Black-Briar now. Left me down here watching this garbage heap.
Maybe if we stopped singing about their silly Nord heroes, the rebels would stop making such a fuss!
Maybe so, but we shouldn't be making concessions before negotiations even start. Makes us look weak.
My agents are telling me that we've appropriated the caravan from Hammerfell... with minimal losses.
Nivenor is my wife. How I was ever able to meet such a gorgeous creature is one of life's mysteries.
No doubt they still tell tales of Mikael and his sweet songs across Cyrodiil, where last I traveled.
No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut it or you'll ruin our ambush.
No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut up or you'll blow our ambush.
None of that matters to me. Until someone takes a Dunmer, I let Windhelm deal with its own problems.
Nords can be quite stubborn. They're slow to change their ways, and we find more heretics every day.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about finding a new ship. I guess it's easier just to stay put.
Not just anyone is allowed inside. Those wishing to enter must show some degree of skill with magic.
Now it seems Mercer's broken his oath with Nocturnal and defiled the very thing he swore to protect.
Now wait a minute, Listener. Even Cicero has his limits! Not many, mind you... but I do have them...
Now, I am afraid I must leave you. We will continue to watch over you, and guide you as best we can.
Now, I have a soul in Oblivion that needs claiming. Take care of the house while I'm gone. Ha ha ha!
Now, if you're going to get those thieves, you should head to Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town.
Now, they're nothing more than ruffians and thugs trying to pry a few extra coin from honest people.
Of course, it would be much easier to check with an alchemist. They occasionally have them for sale.
Oh, I see. Yes, yes of course I'll take a look. Just bring them by whenever it's convenient for you.
Oh, master. It's your time to do with as you please, but what about those who depend on you so much?
Oh... I see. Well then, let me be just say that it's been an honor serving under you Commander Maro.
Oh... wait a second. I see what this is. You want me to cut you in or you'll rat me out to Brynjolf.
One of the guards dropped this key while I hid. I wager it will come in handy for you. Please hurry!
Only inside the gates. Much of Falkreath hold is wilderness and there's plenty of trouble to be had.
Quicksilver Mine is the best mine in Dawnstar, and you can tell those Iron-Breaker miners I said so.
Retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, our founder, from his tomb in the ancient fane of Ustengrav.
Roggi and I do the work around here. My wife and brats just sit around on their brains wasting time.
Rusted. Dry. There was a time when this mace dripped with the blood of the feeble and the worthless.
Sadly, yes. The longer an individual is exposed to the Miasma, the more the mind can become damaged.
Savos doesn't care for politics. He likes to believe the College is removed from the rest of Skyrim.
See, now that's what I'm talking about. Working hard, making your mark on this world. Good job, son.
So I grew up with a miserable trade. This is all I know how to do... prepare and inter the deceased.
So you made it out. Good for you. Don't expect me to thank you. I still remember what you did to me.
Soon, soon. These things must be done properly, you will be inducted as part of the Festival itself.
Stay close and in plain view. No funny business unless you want a few inches of steel in your belly.
Strange house, but strong. Solid. I think I'll open a store. A task to tend to whenever you're away.
Sure, sure. We're always looking to get our hands on items from all over Skyrim. How about this one?
Take it easy, Vekel. How long we known each other? Yeah. I checked it. All the stuff is in the safe.
Thanks again for getting my bow back from those thieves. Next time they come knocking I'll be ready.
That's mighty bold, strutting about like that, looking for a fight. This one will oblige if he must.
That's... great news. I'd... I'd better go. Right now. Before they find me again. This is my chance.
The dark elves are uneasy. There's a killer on the streets. And Viola Giordano won't leave me alone.
The Dragonborn is different - you have an inborn ability to Shout, the same way dragons are said to.
The Dwemer found a loophole, as they always do. To focus the knowledge away and inside without harm.
The energy coming from it has prevented us from reaching you with the visions you have already seen.
The entrance must be past the Forsworn camp. Look for a canyon or cave entrance into the Karthspire.
The only way to get things done in this city is to keep your head down and pay off the right people.
The Star is being used to sustain Malyn's soul. I can't fix it while that fragment of him is inside.
The Thalmor happened. They've been hunting down every Blade they can find for the past thirty years.
Then right before the spiders had moved in, we found that chunk of ore. Never seen anything like it.
Then you've seen them, too. We lost our home, our livestock... We barely have enough gold to get by.
There are those now who wish for a similar change. I am sorry, but that's all I'm at liberty to say.
There may be a way to bypass the barrier, but I must check their library and confirm it can be done.
There were just too many obstacles blocking the way. The plans were shelved and the rest is history.
There's a lot of history in a place like that. I'll bet these walls could tell some amazing stories.
There's a war on. We need every scrap of ore we can get, so we're going to keep digging. Understand?
There's an Altmer named Nelacar staying at the inn outside the College. You should ask him about it.
There's something that's been troubling me, Falk. I am hesitant to share it, but I feel that I must.
They keep the doors locked when they come down. You kill them, you're trapping us here with no food.
They were a secret cabal of the three top rogues in the Thieves Guild. No one knew their identities.
They'd be hiding it, of course. Wouldn't want it to get out that they've been lying this whole time.
Think of him? He's an odd little man. Always poking around the ruins and wasting time in his museum.
This isn't about me paying Iddra back, this is about me being able to pay her back with my own coin.
This library used to be filled with arcane volumes. Now look at it; almost everything's been burned.
This looks like some sort of lever puzzle.  We'll have to figure out the correct order to flip them.
Those who try to hasten the end, may delay it. Those who work to delay the end, may bring it closer.
To glimpse the world inside an Elder Scroll can damage the eyes. Or the mind, as it has to Septimus.
Too many dark elves in Windhelm complain about the way we're treated. What good does complaining do?
True or not, who would dare deny Ulfric's claim, when the legendary Jagged Crown sits upon his brow?
Viarmo, don't you think it's time that the Bards College officially declared support for the empire?
Wait, I know you. You went into the Emperor's Tower, just before... before his decoy was murdered...
We are all Ashlanders now, brother. Good to find another family that cares where they came from, eh?
We can't do that. Every soldier we send to hunt dragons is one more man that can't defend the Reach.
We grow that much stronger with each son and daughter of Skyrim who joins us. Down with the Emperor!
We were doing well, plenty of coin, a huge mansion and I was even betrothed to a lovely young woman.
We were supposed to find a sacrifice. Human sacrifice. I told her I couldn't do it and she attacked.
We're mounting our final attack on Windhelm. You're needed on the front line. Get a move on soldier!
Well all right. Here, I scribbled down the last place I'd heard about. Check it out, but be careful.
Well enough, I suppose. Nilsine bought up most of the tomatoes, and was asking if we could get more.
Well met. Unlike my brother, I've no dislike of strangers. Met lots of 'em while I was a Stormcloak.
Well, at any rate, organization is not my strong suit. Not at all. I need as much help as I can get.
Well, I was thinking sir, with the war going on and all. Maybe, I could enlist? Fight the Imperials?
What I fear, is that the Thalmor will see our victory here and turn greater attention to our shores.
When I get home, I'll have him start on it right away. Come back to pick it up in, oh... three days?
Wherever someone in Skyrim doesn't feel up to defending their own honor, we'll take up their burden.
Who are you? You... you're with the Dark Brotherhood, ain'tcha? I knew it. I knew you'd come for me!
Why would I agree to let a dragon into the heart of my city, after working so hard to keep them out?
With Ulfric dead and the Stormcloaks gone, who will have the courage to champion the cause of Talos?
Wonderful. The only good bard is a dead one, as far as I'm concerned. All that singing and... mirth.
Wow! Then I could dive into a river and swim so far away that Britte and father could never find me.
Year seven, I think? Surprised I haven't cut my own throat out by now, but something keeps me going.
Yes, I am indeed. Elenwen always serves the best wine at her parties. The food is excellent as well.
You can prove your new allegiance to me, by delivering an important message to the Jarl of Whiterun.
You can stick a sword through an Imperial any day you want. But that doesn't make you a Stormcloak. 
You could? I've got some coin coming in from my last shipment. It's yours if you bring my claw back.
You do not remember the Daedric Lord of the Orcs? The keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse?
You have more than earned the right to purchase property and take the next step to becoming a Thane.
You haven't faced that pirate captain yet, have you? Safia? I only ask because you're still alive...
You looking for work? We could use an extra hand in the mine. Just bring me any Corundum you dig up.
You misunderstand our authority. The Greybeards have never involved themselves in political affairs.
You need something talk to my husband. Vantus Loreius. Or just Loreius, if it's all the same to you.
You need to tell your boys to place nice, Delvin. Almost threw two of them into the well last night.
You shouldn't ask me. There's an Altmer named Nelacar in the Frozen Hearth. He's the one to talk to.
You were given this gift by the gods for a reason. It is up to you to figure out how best to use it.
You were weak. Now you are dead. What signs have you left of your passing for us to remember you by?
You will have the honor of bringing a fresh kill for the main course. And I know the perfect person.
You'd better get out of that Stormcloak gear. Today's not the day to go around dressed like a rebel.
You're already mine, Karliah. Your terms were struck long ago. What could you possibly offer me now?
Your blood should be good enough. This will go easier for us both if you don't bother fighting back.
..told him to just hand over the gold, but did he listen? Oh, no... they always have to fight back...
A Jarl has many duties. Attending parties isn't the most important one, but neither is it unpleasant.
A parent should never outlive a child. Having my daughter's spirit here... it's as if she never died.
According to the old legends, only the Dragonborn can Shout without training, the way the dragons do.
Actually, there is, but I don't think I could get away with doing it. She'd kill me if she found out.
After all, the General needs his soldiers out in the field, fighting battles against the Stormcloaks.
After we discovered what she'd done, we spent months trying to track her down, but she just vanished.
Ah, good to see you, brother. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed.
Ah, Winterhold. I've always wanted to visit this place. The secrets locked inside must be astounding.
Ah, you're a clever one aren't you? Now, here's your shiv. Promise you won't ever use it on me, okay?
Al right, this should be enough to figure out what she's up to. Then I can make sure it doesn't work.
All that ever mattered was what was best for Morthal. Leaving it in Ulfric's hands... It's not right.
Also, if your ward isn't negated by an incoming spell, it will recharge itself after a moment or two.
And after you told me that sweet story of how you met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why she left you.
And by Ysmir, if you find work, just do what you're told. There's enough trouble in Markarth already.
And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade, as he told of bold battles and gold he had made!
And the Scrolls have foretold, of black wings in the cold, that when brothers wage war come unfurled!
And you have companionship. A child of night, and a stalker of the sands. Together, you are a family.
Any warrior that gets to be old is either fearsome or a coward. I'll let you find out which Skjor is.
Are you of the sort that believe you're here to change the world? Or are you only in it for yourself?
As in all matters of faith, though, the reality is more complicated than one believer would tell you.
Assur says his pa says the College made lots of bad things happen, but the mages I've seen look nice.
Azura. Mother of Roses. Goddess of Dusk and Dawn. Your chosen champion has returned your Star to you.
Battles are won by trained and disciplined men. Wars are won by talented and exceptional individuals.
Bear you hence this extractor. It will drink the fresh blood of elves. Come when its set is complete.
Before you're one of us, you must swear fealty to Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, future High King of Skyrim.
Besides the fact that there are only a handful of people in Tamriel that even recognize the language?
Best of all, we'd have enough gold to throw around so we can start living in the lap of luxury again.
But don't kill him. I don't hate the man. I just want him to go back to his farm and forget about me.
But heed my warning - the Blades may say they serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have.
But Nocturnal, she influences our luck; nearly imperceptible assistance we get when we ply our trade.
By all the gods, the groom has been killed. At his own wedding! I can only think of my own husband...
Can't say I'm looking forward to that. But, I'll also be training men and women for their new armies.
Clan Battle-Born's got a proud lineage in Whiterun, but unlike the Gray-Manes, we've also got wealth.
Commander Cauis walks around Dragonsreach like a preening rooster. I could do his job blindfolded....
Crazy old coot, from what I've heard. For that to stand out down here, he must really be off his nut.
Day-to-day operations are my responsibility, which means if you become a problem, you get sent to me.
Did he warn you that your own power would be your undoing? That it would only serve to strengthen me?
Did we really save the Empire? Or did we just plant the seeds for Ulfric's uprising, and another war?
Do I look like a merchant to you? You're going to have to take that up with Vex in the Thieves Guild.
Do you know what Indaryn told me? He said if I'm late one more time he'll kick me right out the door!
Do you realize that at a snap of my fingers I can bring the entire Markarth city guard to my defense?
Don't mention the Guild. In fact, it's better if you don't speak to me at all. This is not the place.
Drem. Patience. There are formalities which must be observed, at the first meeting of two of the dov.
Esbern, if the Empire could even acknowledge the Blades existence, we'd all have reason to celebrate.
Even so, we've got to find Esbern before they do. He'll know how to stop the dragons if anybody does.
Eventually. But this... this is the Tomb of Ysgramor. I think I'm just going to... commune for a bit.
Everyone says Eorlund Gray-Mane is the best smith in Skyrim. I plan to change a few minds about that.
Everywhere he looks, he sees assassins, spies an' plots against him. I'm the only one he confides in.
First, prove your tongue can wield a lie. Find someone. Gain his trust. Lead him to the shrine above.
Follow me. Quickly and quietly now. I want their guts on the ground before they even know we're here.
For someone in possession of the Skeleton Key, stealing the Eyes of the Falmer would be child's play.
For twenty-five years I ran, never sleeping in the same place twice and carefully covering my tracks.
Genuine Falmerblood Elixir for sale! Live for thousands of years... see into other people's thoughts!
Good going... you got arrested. Now how do you think that looks for the Guild? Better luck next time.
Got a shop owner with a very choice item a client wants to get his hands on if you do the dirty work.
Guess I should have known. Maven and Sibbi have been at odds ever since she had him tossed into jail.
Have no fear. I believe it is within you to excel in your studies. But you must learn to concentrate!
He had your soft face, and that silly grin you get when you've done something wrong. That's his, too.
He watches over all Orcs as his children. A truth those who leave the stronghold are quick to forget.
Hmmm. Never read anything from the temple before. I suppose there wouldn't be any harm in reading it.
Hmph. Most certainly not. But perhaps I can teach you how to put some candles out. We'll start there.
Hundreds of years have gone into assembling this collection. It's going to stay pristine, understand?
I believe the Legate gave you an order. Why are you standing around here flapping your jaw? Move out!
I borrowed some gold from Sapphire to pay for the shipment, but it got robbed before it even arrived.
I could soul trap you. Place you inside the Star. Then bring you back once Malyn has been dealt with.
I don't care what you promise. If I tell you the buyer's name and word gets around, it could ruin me!
I have no time or patience for a student. Perhaps the College of Winterhold will grant you admission.
I know I sound abrasive. It's just that I love Mauhulakh so much that I want us to be happy together.
I may have lost a drop or two of blood. Truth is, I'm not going anywhere like this. Hurts to breathe.
I need someone to take this small keg of Black-Briar Mead to Wilhelm at the Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead.
I see you've been allowed to know some secrets before your appointed time. No matter. Yes, it's true.
I suggest we meet there in a few hours, and see what awaits us inside. That's all for now, thank you.
I suppose that makes sense. You didn't mention a Sam and nothing you said about the staff made sense.
I think [QUOTE]Seven Septims for Sigurd[QUOTE] will do nicely. Especially when they're in their cups.
I want soldiers sent to deal with these dragons. Every able-bodied man and woman who can carry a bow.
I was about to let that wench marry into the richest family in Riften, and this is how she repays me.
I wasn't sure it'd ever happen. Here. I want you to have this. My way of saying [QUOTE]thanks.[QUOTE]
I wasn't sure that he'd see the light, but I'm sure you [QUOTE]explained[QUOTE] it to him. Well done!
I wasn't wanting to get anyone in trouble, sir. Just wanting to get the new planting started, is all.
I worry about my brother. This way I can keep an eye on him, make sure he's not getting into trouble.
I worry about my sister. This way I can keep an eye on her, make sure she's not getting into trouble.
I would just like to remind everyone, once again, that Restoration is indeed a valid school of magic.
I yield. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, the Argonians will be paid as much as any other worker.
I'd always intended Mercer's fate to ultimately be decided by the Guild, and it seems they've spoken.
I'll be glad when this beast is gone from here. Do whatever it is you need to do with it, Dragonborn.
I'm a bard, trained at the Bards College in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying.
I'm a deadeye marksman, lethal with a blade and dangerous in bed. And it only gets better from there.
I'm as much a Nord as the next man, but I'm no fool. I don't live in the past, like those Gray-Manes.
I'm glad I'll have you beside me in there. This place chills my blood, and I don't care who knows it.
I'm relieved you discovered a bottle intact; this place looks as though it was ransacked by the orcs.
I've been talking to my sources around the holds, and think I may have heard where one of them lives.
I've found the final resting place of the Jagged Crown. Can you believe it? Well, I'm almost certain.
I've given us a chance to speak privately, but I'm afraid I can't do this for long. We must be brief.
If that's what you want. Watch your back out there, and if you need me again, you know where I'll be.
If you actually want to get out alive, I'd bring whatever you need to move quietly, and kill quickly.
If you ever need the skills of a Khajiit warrior by your side, I would be honored to travel with you.
If you want to help stop that dragon, your best bet is to go to Solitude and join up with the Legion.
Ingun! If you want to remain in my shop as an apprentice I expect you to act like one. No exceptions!
It happened so fast. One minute the dragon was there, the next it was gone. Everything was destroyed.
It means you have the Dragon Blood - you have an inborn ability to use your Voice the way dragons do.
It would seem that the College has what you seek. The question now is what you can offer the College.
It's a small town, with one rather unique feature - it houses Skyrim's only Penitus Oculatus outpost.
It's an old city. Legends say Dwarves built it first. Then after they vanished, the natives moved in.
It's believed that they are literally what guides our uncanny luck... by placing their hands in ours.
It's clearly magical in nature, but like nothing I've ever seen before. He should be most interested.
It's enough for me to know that he's out there somewhere, and not locked up like an animal in a cage.
It's Hemming. He's making advances and I can't bear the man's presence. Is there anything you can do?
It's like... he wants to talk. Likes people and all. But he stays separate, because he's supposed to.
It's this place. It feels like home. It's just nice to finally have something going right in my life.
It's tough to keep track of Hrefna. If her father wasn't such a snowback, he'd be around to help out.
Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again. Not lost, you see, just forgotten.
Just because you've been accepted here so quickly, don't think I'm going to help you rise any faster.
Kodlak White-Mane has been laid to rest, I know. May his soul live forever in the halls of Sovngarde.
Let's make sure we're just as productive this month as we were last. If Bryling's happy, we're happy.
Let's pretend we haven't. What's Alduin's Wall and what does it have to do with stopping the dragons?
Let's see. From a Loredas of Last Seed until a Middas of Heartfire... it will happen soon. Very soon.
Let's see... this one, I think. J'zargo has designed it to be an excellent flame cloak, with a twist.
Let's try and stay together, the sorcerers in these places tend to... well, harvest bodies for parts.
Like I told you, last time I saw her she was headed for Hobs Fall Cave. No idea what happened to her.
Look at this. Cowards must have locked the place down after Skjor charged in. You can taste the fear.
Magic is for the weak. Elves, I mean. They keep to that College in Winterhold. They know their place.
Mercer is being Mercer. If he has a plan to get us out of this rut, then he isn't sharing it with me.
Mercer lied to the Guild, branded me a murderer and slandered my name across his network of contacts.
My friend Dorthe doesn't like my pranking. [QUOTE]You're being mean, Frodnar![QUOTE] So what if I am?
My mother sees things. She doesn't know why, but she does. Only sometimes, she doesn't see me at all.
My mother was a Companion. And her mother. And all the women in my family, back to Hrotti Blackblade.
My travels have taken me from High Rock to Valenwood, Elsweyr to Morrowind and all points in between.
Never heard of anybody like that. But if you want to hide out in Riften, the Ratway's where you'd be.
No one in the Jarl's court is above the charge of conspiring against the city. You're coming with us.
No! Please, grandmother, don't do that. I'm fine. Really. Can we just... not talk about this anymore?
No. I don't have any idea. I was just shopping for a pendant for my sister back in the Imperial City.
Nobody knows his true identity. Well, nobody except Gaius Maro, and you've already taken care of him.
Nocturnal's whim is the greatest mystery to everyone. There have been volumes written on the subject.
Not really. Just that it's very, very old. It was one of the first cities of men in Tamriel, I think.
Nothing raises my ire more than having an agreement broken. It's bad for business and it wastes time.
Now... I don't really want to touch that thing, though. Do you think you could handle the next steps?
Of course he wasn't you stupid whore; he's a man. Now I'm not going to warn you again. Is that clear?
Of course, dear. Of course. And, from what my little ravens tell me, you handled yourself quite well.
Of course, they'd never come into direct contact with Nocturnal but they insisted they had her favor.
Off to Bleak Falls Barrow with you. The Jarl is not a patient man. Neither am I, come to think of it.
Oh, and if you bump into Indaryn from the meadery, keep your mouth shut. He'd rat us out in a second.
Oh, but the Listener jests with poor Cicero. You already have company. You don't need my help at all.
Oh, Haelga... there you are. Your special order from Hammerfell came in off the last Khajiit caravan.
Oh... I've heard of this. They say these walls show the history of the ancients who built this place.
Okay, okay. Come inside, then. Sigrid will get you something to eat and you can tell me all about it.
One last thing, Irileth. This isn't a death or glory mission. I need to know what we're dealing with.
One of the servants had a wonderful idea. Fireproofing Dragonsreach. In case of attack by, um... air.
One sure mark of a fool is to dismiss anything that falls outside his experience as being impossible.
Options were in short supply. Ranmir and I grew up here, and nearly any money I make, he drinks away.
Our actions have always been one in the same; both of us lie, cheat and steal to further our own end.
Perhaps now you have some insight into the forces that shape the vennesetiid... the currents of Time.
Perhaps we would have dragon allies against Alduin if the ancient Blades had not acted so arrogantly.
Petra! Evil Petra put me here, stole my tower. Hate her, chew her bones! Let me out, kind, kind meat.
Ponder the meaning of spirit. Unslaad zii. Where mortal flesh may wither and die, the spirit endures.
Revenge? No. I want submission. I want the priest who did this to bend his knee and give me his soul.
Right now, all that matters is my daughter Mila. No man's going to get between me and my little girl.
Right you are, elf! Or even from the rebels, if they've got enough money to make a competitive offer.
Savor your triumph, Dovahkiin. This is not the last of what you will write upon the currents of Time.
Seems like capturing Riften is turning out to be more of a hassle than a benefit. But what do I know?
She was... he ripped her apart. Like a sabre cat tears a deer. We barely found enough of her to bury.
She's also got ties to the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild, so basically no one can touch her.
Silence, idiot! I should have known better... to trust this place after it's been riddled with filth.
Skyrim couldn't be more different from Elsweyr. But magic... Magic's the same no matter where you go.
Sleep? I can't sleep now! There's too much to be done. And what's this Void you're rambling on about?
Soldiers! They're everywhere these days. And not a one of them knows how to pick up after themselves.
Studies stars you say? Why, there hasn't been a mage doing anything related to stars since.... Oh....
Success means that the Guild is gettin' stronger. We've picked up another merchant and a new recruit.
Thank you so much. I swear it's a fight with them every shipment. Here's something for your troubles.
Thanks to the White-Gold Concordat, they've been able to operate throughout the Empire with impunity.
That godless Emperor can shove his damn treaty into the steaming nether-reaches of my you-know-where.
That is precisely why we remain neutral. Ours is to tell tales of empires, not to make or break them.
That is quite enough. Perhaps I will raise these issues when I have an audience with General Tullius.
That's a fair question. None of us have ever seen a dragon before, or expected to face one in battle.
That's fine. We needed his help. Now we don't, and it's long past time for him to pay for his crimes.
That's it! Come on, let's get out of here before the dragon brings the whole tower down on our heads.
That's right. Welcome to Markarth, traveler. Thank the Divines you can choose to live somewhere else.
That's the only time when we get food, too. And if there's not enough ore mined up, we don't get any.
That's what scares me. I'm afraid I'll travel to Darkwater Crossing and find it burned to the ground.
The answer is simple. Orcs. There is a stronghold nearby whose hunters can butcher a deer in seconds.
The Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes were written by the Mythic Dawn cult leader, Mankar Camoran.
The Dark Elves live in a run-down slum called the Gray Quarter. Ulfric's content to keep it that way.
The Empire, in its wisdom, has come to recognize Talos worship as a barbaric remnant of a bygone age.
The Forsworn? Strange. Well, I hope the Eight give you more peace in the future, for what it's worth.
The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften... a tavern called the Ragged Flagon.
The Guild has welcomed me back with open arms. I feel like a void in my life has finally been filled.
The key is that ugly dwarven urn in his shop. Smash that thing to bits and he'll change his attitude.
The Legion will be staying here for quite some time. I don't expect there to be any further violence.
The longer they're around, the more danger I'm in! Please, kill Kematu and end this nightmare for me!
The nature of the favors varies per deity. Please, feel free to worship at any or all of the shrines.
The only reason dragons are attacking is because Talos is angry with us for turning our backs on him.
The ordinary citizen will be happy to get back to life as normal, to have their families return home.
The poor dear must truly be hungry to comb through rubbish like that. Hope he finds something edible.
The round one, for tuning. Dwemer music is soft and subtle, and needed to open their cleverest gates.
The Stormcloaks can rot in Oblivion for all I care. I've lived in this city for twenty years. Twenty!
The worship of the false god Talos contributed to the unfortunate friction that led to the Great War.
Then we stood and fought, our shield-wall defending until by dawn's light the Legion's ranks wavered.
Then... there is hope after all. For so long, all I could do was watch our doom approach, helplessly.
There are those who would silence the Dragon's truth! But not I! Not Heimskr! His word will be known!
There is another thing you could do for me. Suitable for someone of your particular talents, perhaps.
There weren't any dragons then, idiot. They're just coming back now for the first time in... forever.
There's an author named Adonato staying at the inn. He's published a few works of historical fiction.
There's news of rebellion against the Empire. Strange noises have been heard in the marshes at night.
They say that something happened in the Hall of the Dead. Brother Verulus has the whole place closed.
This here's Candlehearth Hall. Great room's upstairs, an' there's a bed for rent on the ground floor.
This is very irregular. I trust that whatever you're doing doesn't compromise my position in any way?
Trying to stay alive. I think time's running out though. I'm pretty sure the Thalmor know where I am.
Typical Imperial lies. First you take away Talos, now you're keeping us from seeing our honored dead?
Uh, right. Maybe just one of the popular songs, like [QUOTE]The Slaying of the Falmer Princes[QUOTE]?
Umm... don't suppose you'd want to take that fire somewhere else? You know... somewhere away from me?
Unfortunately, a sword can't repair damaged buildings, feed hungry people or undo years of prejudice.
Urog is a good learner. I'm glad I have the chance to teach her. Makes me not miss the woods as much.
Use subtlety and suggestion to turn his thoughts to the war. You're his steward, he'll listen to you.
Vulwulf! The Empire may be our enemy, but Asgeir is still our son and we're a long way from Cyrodiil.
We have survived difficult times, and are better mages for it. We owe you that, Arch-Mage. Thank you.
We're all pretty new at this, right? Let's just give it a chance. What's the worst that could happen?
We're gathering for our final assault on Solitude. I need you there. Report to our camp in Haafingar.
We're looking for information about a woman -- a foreigner in these lands. She's a Redguard, like us.
We've been contracted to make sure Brand-Shei remembers not to meddle in affairs that aren't his own.
Well, he's quite obviously mad. Whether or not that makes him dangerous is another question entirely.
Well, I think this is an excellent start. I'd like you all to continue practicing with wards, please.
Well... why are you still standing here? Oh, right. You need to know where they are! That would help.
What brings you, wayfarer grim, to wander here, in Sovngarde, souls-end, Shor's gift to honored dead?
What do you think? Are we going to let Ulfric dictate terms to us before the negotiations even start?
What kind of a mentor would I be if I denied a potential student a glimpse at his master's ingenuity!
What? You left him on his own? With the Thalmor after him? Go make sure he's safe and bring him here!
What's there to say? You go against the Empire, you wind up dead. Thorald got what was coming to him.
When Gulum-Ei was getting us merchandise from the East Empire Company, we were making a hefty profit.
When I married Torygg, he promised we'd go to lavish parties just like this. I wish he were here now.
With any luck, a worthy hero will step forward and solve our problems, just like in the tales of old.
Would you be interested in gathering some materials for me? I'd certainly be happy to compensate you.
Yeah, I know what you mean. If things don't start getting better soon, I may look for work elsewhere.
Yes, yes I did. I've already sent instructions, you just need to make sure this arrives in one piece.
You been to Markarth? They've got a tavern called the Silver-Blood Inn. Best ale this side of Skyrim.
You can pretend not to hear me all you want... but you better stay out of the Black-Briars' business.
You do not even know our tongue, do you? Such arrogance, to dare take for yourself the name of Dovah.
You ever need another blade at your side, just ask. Wouldn't mind seeing how you handle a few trolls.
You have quite the bounty on your head in The Pale. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. 
You have quite the bounty on your head in The Rift. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. 
You have quite the bounty on your head in Whiterun. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. 
You know I can't tell you that. As soon as I do, and you have a few meads in you, everyone will know.
You should see the grin on Horik's face now that we're in charge. I know he hides it, but I can tell.
You shouldn't even know about that. Remember you're not a full Companion yet, whelp. Know your place.
You... you found her? I can't believe it. Let the girl come with me and we can begin her preparation.
You'd better get to Riften. Talk to Brynjolf. He's... well-connected. A good starting point at least.
You're a clever girl, Karliah. Buying Goldenglow Estate and funding Honningbrew Meadery was inspired.
You're sure? When you see Giruad, ask for a tip. I'm sure he'll be in a good mood after reading this.
You've become a true hero of Skyrim. I number you among my kin. You shall now be known as Stormblade.
You've come to Dawnstar at a strange time, friend. Seems everyone in the town is having nightmares...
[QUOTE]No matter what, we stay together[QUOTE], Hafnar said. I looked him in the eyes and lied to him.
A likely story. They won't even do their own dirty work now, eh? Well, you won't get the better of me!
Ah, let's see, what else... The Bards College is here, and the main office of the East Empire Company.
Ah, now I understand. This is about that my father's hidden cache, isn't it? The dowry for my wedding.
Ah. I sometimes forget you are not versed in the dragon tongue as we are. This is a rough translation:
Ah... the power of the dragon is yours! There can be no doubt that you are the Dragonborn of prophecy.
Ahem. Mi mi mi mi. Pardon me. Just, um, warming up. Never know when I may be called upon for a ballad.
Alduin always was pahlok - arrogant in his power. Uznahgar paar. He took domination as his birthright.
All right, you convinced me. Doubt I'd be much good to you, anyway. The little fop cut me pretty deep.
Ancano has somehow locked himself in the hall. He's up to something, and I intend to put a stop to it.
And skillfully, too. I've been watching you for ages, it seems. You have the makings of a fine hunter.
Are you bloody serious? You're not going to get ahead by quitting around here, that I can promise you.
Are you out of your mind? We said no bloodshed! Well, guess what. You can just forget about your gold.
As Jarl Laila's housecarl, I would ask that you maintain a respectable distance from her at all times.
As restless as ever, sir, but I don't see them taking any kind of incendiary action. Not soon, anyway.
Be mindful. My maid Tekla has been known to pass information to that pompous nephew of mine, Siddgeir.
Being honorable might make you a good man, but it doesn't make you right. Be a better world if it did.
Bolfrida is certainly grating, but she pays well. Thankfully nobody from the city can see me out here.
Bring whatever he's carrying to me, and I'll send you with convincing misinformation back to Dawnstar.
But I have a place here, and I wouldn't want to dishonor my clan by leaving again like some young pup.
By Azura, it gets hot in there. I use Frost Salts for a potion to keep the heat bearable, but I'm out.
By killing Madanach you've freed Markarth from his hidden tyranny. On behalf of the city, I thank you.
Clearly. I've never even thought of him in that manner. I wish that I was as skilled with words as he.
Come back in a few nights when the wedding reception is over and we'll start the ceremony when you do.
Countless dead haunt countless sleepless nights... when Skyrim becomes whole again, perhaps so will I.
Cut out the middleman, eh? Shrewd, very shrewd. You sure you don't have some Black-Briar blood in you?
Dear me. All this trouble over me? I think I was confused. There's no harm in him. Please, let him go.
Dear sister, we talked about this sort of thing before. We sell dry goods, nothing more, nothing less.
Delphine? How do you ... ? This is just a trick to get me to open the door, eh? I told you to go away!
Did he, now? That doesn't sound like my nephew at all. I doubt he'd be mixed up with the likes of you.
Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it Colovian brandy. These terms are still not acceptable.
Don't let it get you down. Indaryn will eventually tire of picking on you and move on to someone else.
Don't you see? Fate has led you to me and to the pieces. Dagon has to answer our call. We're so close.
Dravin! One of the soldiers I spoke to on the way home said you threatened them. What's come over you?
Due to your adventurous nature several of the college professors have some things they wish you to do.
Esbern's your man for that kind of thing. He may be able to at least point you in the right direction.
Gulum-Ei started to get greedy and cut us out of the deal. Almost can't say I blame the scaly bastard.
Hah! Who in their right mind would pay for dirt? You'd get laughed out of Whiterun for even trying it.
Have you? All good, I trust. But you have me at a disadvantage. I'm afraid I know nothing about you...
He's tough, loyal to his men and a good leader, but if you're not a Nord, Ulfric will never trust you.
Here. Wouldn't want you going into a fight on an empty stomach. I'll have another meal ready tomorrow.
Hey, if the Empire and the Stormcloaks want to kill each other over some foolish cause, I say let 'em.
Hmm... Yes, you do raise a good point. What about the [QUOTE]Sweet Maidenfair from Hadleyshire[QUOTE]?
Hmmm... Well, maybe we could go on a sort of trip. Take the wares on the road. Get some new customers.
I admit, the dragons are a concern, but we can avoid them if we do not stay in one place for too long.
I bid you to drink deeply from the Ebonmere, mortal. For this is where the Agent of Nocturnal is born.
I can have a group of men ready at a moment's notice. Many would be willing to help rescue my brother.
I can't believe Gulum-Ei's mixed up in all this; that Argonian couldn't find his tail with both hands.
I don't know how you convinced Ulfric to talk to the Empire. Worse than a waste of time if you ask me.
I envy you, you know. To climb the 7,000 Steps again... I made the pilgrimage once, did you know that?
I had quite the mentor. He taught me everything he know about the nirnroot and its strange properties.
I just know that our sailors are able to keep their ship quarters clean, and I expect the same of you.
I knew you could do it... I believed in you, and yet... I still didn't think I'd live to see this day.
I know how this works, Tullius. I've learned the value of Imperial promises the hard way. Never again.
I like being stronger when I become the wolf. But Kodlak says it is bad for the soul, and I trust him.
I mean, it would take months... years to work out the differentials. But what a revolutionary concept.
I swear they're making me do this for a laugh. At least I'm not dealing with the prisoners down below.
I think she would be happy to know that our collection has brought smiles to faces both young and old.
I think things are going to be a lot different around here from now on and I have you to thank for it.
I told you before, Skald, I have no interest in taking sides in this war. I've no desire to be killed.
I was actually scouting a bit the other day, old times sake. Spied a brigand heading back to his camp.
I was assigned to Ulfric's guard. We were on our way to Darkwater Crossing, in the south of Eastmarch.
I was far from here on the day of Alduin's downfall. But all dov felt the... sundering of Time itself.
I was just a boy, but I had the fire of a man in my heart. Eventually, my body caught up to my spirit.
I'm afraid I'm running errands at the moment. But please, visit me later at the Temple of the Divines.
I'm all too aware that my arrival has aroused suspicion, especially in Ancano, your Thalmor associate.
I'm raising you to Praefect. Take this blade, as a gift and symbol of your new rank. You've earned it.
I'm really afraid of Grelod. When Aventus escaped, she was so mad. I got double the beatings that day.
I'm sure he's Thalmor. Just waiting for me to leave so he can follow me and kill me in a lonely place.
I'm taking command here for the moment. You head back to Whiterun and let the Jarl know what happened.
I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time and I'll see what I can do.
I've been looking to expand the business, and your investment will certainly help with that. I accept!
I've never been a sellsword... never traded my skills for pay. I've always adventured on my own terms.
If Eorlund made it, it's more likely you're gripping it wrong. Find me tomorrow and we can go over it.
If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would have come true. He honors us all.
If it's true that the dragons have returned, what will it mean for all of us? Is this how it all ends?
If you need it, you can get a room for a fair price at the Winking Skeever, just inside the main gate.
If you want me to leave, you could challenge me to a fight. I promise to stop once you've lost an arm.
If you wish to learn more about them, you're welcome to my tome on the subject. Should be on my table.
If you're here for the College, don't let the folks in town bother you. Just try and keep to yourself.
In the middle of it all, the College was practically untouched. Many of the survivors were suspicious.
It has been a profitable journey, and yet I long for the warm sands of Elsweyr more and more each day.
It is true there are some here who have spent years studying the accumulated knowledge of the scrolls.
It used to be a huge system hundreds of years ago but it fell into decay just like the rest of Riften.
It was only 20 years back that the Reachmen rebelled. Even took control of Markarth itself for a time.
It was you who fought the Thalmor and their puppets who would have us deny our gods and our heritage. 
It's a great honor for them to summon you. They speak to very few - in fact, they hardly speak at all.
Jarl Elisif the Fair. Poor woman. Losing her husband and king like that. It was a dark day for us all.
Just a prank? Just a prank? The Daedric Lord of Debauchery does not deal in mere [QUOTE]pranks.[QUOTE]
Just be careful where you do it. Some cowards in this land can't stand the sight of glory before them.
Just like Talos himself at the Battle of Old Hroldan, reclaiming the Reach from those heathen natives.
Kill these casters as fast as you can, otherwise they may summon creatures we don't want to deal with.
Liars and bastards. Every one of them. I'd have their heads on a pike if it wasn't for the war effort.
Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul darkness has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy.
Masters of the Way of the Voice. They live in seclusion high on the slopes of the Throat of the World.
Maven, please. I didn't know it was your man. Had I known, I would have looked the other way, I swear.
Most of the business we get is from folks here to visit the College, though even that's dried up some.
My duty is simple - oversee the Thalmor Justiciars, and make sure they perform their duties admirably.
My lord. Please. This is no time for rash action. I just think we need more information before we act.
My pleasure. But I think it's time for you to go. No fun keeping you locked up in here with the staff.
My Star has been restored and Malyn's soul has been consigned to Oblivion. You have done well, mortal.
Nepos the Nose? He's been in Markarth forever. And he's well-respected among the natives of the Reach.
Never knew what became of the rest of the clan that survived. I suppose they moved on just like I did.
No luck there, lass. Something must have fallen on the other side of the door because it isn't moving!
No matter what Gavros said, this was my idea first. The Council is going to know that when I get back.
No! Linwe prefers stealing from the deceased. Digs up the corpses, breaks into the Hall of the Dead...
Nothing? And what of my son? Hmm? What of Thorald? Is he nothing? So don't talk to me about suffering!
Now - hear his name. Odahviing. Taste it on the wind. Od-ah-viing. Know it in your su'um. Od-ah-viing!
Now it's time to face the consequences of your actions. You don't leave this shack until someone dies.
Now, if you'll pardon me, I'm going to tend to Nurelion. I can make his final days a bit less painful.
Oh, don't give me that look. Fine. I supposed I can find some menial task to set your mind on. Hmm....
Oh, he'll rot in prison for this one I promise you. As soon as Maven finds out, it's all over for him.
Oh, I'd love to help you figure it out, but I'm so busy cleaning up the mess you made of our temple...
Oh, thank goodness! I've been wandering alone for so long, I thought I'd never see another soul again.
Oh. Was it something I said? I can't afford to lower the price, but come back if you change your mind.
Oh... I'm afraid I may have overreacted. Please, I've already forgotten whatever it was he said to me.
Once the Emperor is convinced of the need, then you will see the full strength of the Imperial Legion.
Once you get to the tower, head north. Bleak Falls Barrow should be just around the corner further up.
Peace? When has any Nord ever known peace? Skyrim breeds warriors. It's who we are, it's in our blood.
Perfect. Hopefully this will let us know more about their movement. I think we've got them on the run!
Please. I must remain uninterrupted if I am to complete the ritual. Have no fear, your time will come.
Power is the crux of this world. There's always more of it to be had, if you look in the right places.
Quintus, could you fetch me a copy of The Firmament? I need to compare the old star charts to today's.
Shatter-Shield, East Empire Company... we'll work for any ship that pulls in, as long as they can pay.
She... she said that? She said those words... to you?  [QUOTE]Darkness rises when silence dies[QUOTE]?
Should the need arise, a portal connects the Sepulcher and Nightingale Hall. Use it whenever you wish.
Skyrim needs people like you, if we ever hope to regain our freedom from the damned Empire. Good luck.
Speak with Amaund Motierre at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. He will know the true Emperor's location.
Still, even with the rough treatment we've had at the hands of Ulfric and his lot, I've got ties here.
Summoning an Unbound Dremora is not like other Conjuration spells. It will not simply do your bidding.
That is the kind of thing Kodlak used to say. And he was right. But still, I'd like to see for myself.
That old woman who runs the orphanage has been murdered. Say, didn't I see you coming out of there...?
That would be acceptable. You can tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
That, and I made my fortune by knowing when to spend my septims, and when not to. I can't stand waste.
That's it! You've collected every last verse. I can't thank you enough. This deserves a special bonus.
That's just you getting skinnier every day, old man. You're losing your padding. You need to eat more.
That's what you said about the Wisp Essence and it turned out to be crushed nirnroot mixed with water!
The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Pale, allowing Jarl Skald the Elder to return from exile.
The Eye has grown unstable. It cannot remain here, or else it may destroy your College and this world.
The Jarl will definitely want to talk to you. You'll find him in Dragonsreach, at the top of the hill.
The kind of things that even the College won't tolerate. Things that can get a wizard exiled for life.
The name's Maul; I watch the streets for the Black-Briars. If you need dirt on anything, I'm your guy.
The Palace of the Kings in which you now stand is one of the last buildings that remain from that era.
The paltry amount of coin that I place in the charity box at the temple is the least I can do to help.
The poor dear must truly be hungry to comb through rubbish like that. Hope she finds something edible.
The task of Steward is more important than you realize. The Jarl often asks for my invaluable council.
The Thalmor see our Order as a threat because we have power, and we will not allow them to control us.
The truth is less pleasant. It is...was, the grave of Vighar, my own ancestor, dead for centuries now.
The White-Gold Concordat. Our treaty with the Elves after the Great War forbids free worship of Talos.
Then there's a little matter of some recruiting. I have someone in mind I'd like to join our campaign.
There was some ruckus over by that weird black door. You weren't involved in that craziness, were you?
There's a fourth piece. That scabbard in the display case. Built to house the Razor. And there's more.
There's just so much to memorize. How am I supposed to remember what goes where for every single herb?
There's this old man. I've seen him around Riften. I don't know where he lives. I don't know his name.
They have some of our boys locked up there. But with a little luck, we can turn that to our advantage.
They named me Thane, and they got my nephew Siddgeir in my place. A real friend to Cyrodiil, that one.
They worry that Tullius is so focused on the war, that he risks forgetting what's best for our people.
Think about your choices carefully from now on. You'll go much farther in Riften with me on your side.
This is the bridge out of town. The path up the mountain to the northwest leads to Bleak Falls Barrow.
This is where you'll be staying. This bed and desk are yours. Please try and be considerate of others.
This key opens one of my stashes in the basement of the meadery. Help yourself to any of its contents.
This marvelous object. It practically radiates magicka, and yet it's unlike anything I've felt before.
This should come in handy. Here. Let me show you a few tricks I've learned about buttering up royalty.
This will take time to decryptify. Be on your way, and Septimus will find  you if he has further need.
This would of course mean that Tamriel, indeed all of Mundus, is actually contained within the sphere.
Thorald and I have history, all right? We used to be friends. So I looked into it when he disappeared.
Time is running, Farengar, don't forget. This isn't some theoretical question. Dragons have come back.
To think that I would sit down at the same table with that... Thalmor bitch. Either she walks or I do.
Tolfdir and I can try and keep this contained. You need to get your hands on the Staff of Magnus. Now.
Ulfric will withdraw his forces from Hjaalmarch, allowing Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone to return to Morthal.
Wasn't enough for me, though. I left. Didn't want to end up as the third wife of some lowly chieftain.
We all knew this was the end. Without even opening the door, we knew what was behind it would kill us.
We bring his compassion where none can be found, by cleansing all those who would offend his children.
We didn't pay much attention to it when I was a boy - everyone still had their little shrine to Talos.
We got the mill up and running before we found out that the big stand of trees on the hill was sacred.
We have felt the whisper of a Word. Give me your map, and I will show you where its echo can be found.
We have to wait for nighttime though. The other one is playing too, and she can't come out until then.
We live by his code and follow his teachings. Spend some time with the wise woman and you'll remember.
We must also have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack.
We're married. I guess we'll need to decide where we're living, won't we? You can always stay with me.
We're not fighting we're just.... Why don't I get you something to eat? Mama and papa will talk later.
We're running low on the Black-Briar mead. In a couple days I'll have you make a run, fetch some more.
We've got honor. Wealth and titles, too. Aye, and buxom women to warm your bed on a cold Skyrim night.
Well, I was right, wasn't I? Focused completely wrong by the time we got here! The cold had warped it!
Well, now. There's no need to ruin the party on my account. I don't think he'll be bothering me again.
Well, you can tell that... that long-eared ass not to come around the store anymore. He's not welcome.
What would you have me do, Hrongar? Your brother is the Jarl. You know I can't question his judgement.
What's important is that all of this work was designed to reveal to us sources of great magical power.
When Grimvar asks me why women are being killed around the city. I don't even know what to say to him.
When I was a boy, my friends and I used to play [QUOTE]seek the wumpus[QUOTE] in caves much like this.
When their uprising was crushed, I had Madanach brought to me. He was a wild animal, but a useful one.
Why specifically stars? Wait, you aren't referring to... No, there's no way you would know about that.
Word on the street says that the Thieves Guild is coming back into its own in Markarth so I figured...
Yes, he matches the description of this Esbern guy you're looking for. Maybe it's him. Maybe it isn't.
You assassins and your riddles. It really does get very annoying, you know. Now if you'll excuse me...
You bring a smile to this one's eyes and peace to his heart. Take this. A small token of appreciation.
You come do an honest day's work at my mill, and I'll pay you an honest day's wages. Then we'll drink.
You did well here today. I don't think the truce will last long, but that will not be on your account.
You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat few manage and live to tell about.
You have quite the bounty on your head in Eastmarch. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. 
You have quite the bounty on your head in Falkreath. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. 
You have quite the bounty on your head in Haafingar. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. 
You have quite the bounty on your head in The Reach. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. 
You know. Where do you get your goods? I am always amazed at how you manage to sell things so cheaply.
You should think harder on your commitment to Skyrim's freedom next time you're deciding what's right.
You think some Emperor sitting on a gilded throne in Cyrodiil is going to know what's best for Skyrim?
You, too, huh? I'd take a straight fight with the whole Legion over creeping around a place like this.
You're strong. Clever. I'd be proud to face the challenges of life with you, if you feel the same way.
You've made a mess of things and Maven's furious. I told you not to burn more than three of the hives!
[QUOTE]Because Solitude would not soon bend knee, Olaf would hurt them while his status accrued.[QUOTE]
A lot of people are beginning to get impressed with you here. Me included. Just wanted to let you know.
A pick breaking when it shouldn't have, the clouds in the nighttime sky clearing at the wrong moment...
Ah, it doesn't matter. What's done is done, right? Cicero is here! As is the Night Mother! Joy of joys!
Ah, well. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.
Ah, you're back. I hope you've made some progress on tracking down this Shout we need to defeat Alduin?
All right. Had I known the deal would bring me this much trouble, I never would have accepted the gold.
Among other things, the Dwemer were expert trap-makers. Watch the floor for tripwires and false plates.
And believe me, I don't say that to everyone. I'm very discriminating when it comes to the female form.
And here you are. Good. Come in, browse the display, and let's talk. I have a job you look perfect for.
And so then came the clashing and slashing of steel, as the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!
And then get back here. Because if Ulfric isn't bluffing, I'll need every able body to defend Whiterun.
And to think I was wandering the ash wastes only two years ago. I never knew my path would lead to you.
And you've proven that was the best move I could have made. Don't give me that look. You're free to go.
And... good work. The next time you find yourself exploring Nordic ruins, perhaps this will be helpful.
Anyway, I'm glad my work at the Black-Briar Meadery keeps me busy. Helps me keep my mind off of things.
Are you kidding me? We're all alone out here except for a few guards who couldn't give a damn about us.
As if Skyrim didn't have enough outsiders. Now we've got mercenaries from Hammerfell struttin' about...
At least Narfi has Reyda's Necklace... reminds Narfi of his sister. Thank you for giving this to Narfi.
At long last, Windhelm is free. No longer must we suffer persecution at the hands of Ulfric Stormcloak.
Been here ever since I left the Bards College. Turns out a few muscles earn more gold than a damn lute.
Blade and shadow, silence and death - these are my arts. For a modest fee, I'll make great art for you.
Both the Imperials and Stormcloaks have sent riders this way, scouting the bridge and the lands nearby.
But being happy or unhappy is a choice you make, and I've chosen to make the best of things that I can.
But he willingly gave up this existence that we might better understand the vagaries of life and death.
But I do less business than I used to. The Stormcloaks don't like buying from anyone that isn't a Nord.
But the old tales tell of the Dragonborn who could kill dragons and steal their power. You must be one!
But the only way you're going to get past the guards is if they really believe you're an invited guest.
But without Ulfric to inflame their passions, they'll settle down and return to their homes eventually.
But, I bow before your certainty. In a way I envy you. The curse of much knowledge is often indecision.
But... I don't yet know how you can stop him. The prophecy doesn't say. But Alduin's Wall does. I hope.
Damn those Gray-Manes to Oblivion. They want to back the Stormcloaks, they'll get what's comin' to 'em.
Do you... do you think that could happen here? I mean, could a dragon come here and burn the city down?
Don't worry, I'm mad at her, too. And at myself for ever agreeing to get involved in her insane scheme.
Dragonborn. Here, use my sword to do it. This moment will be immortalized in song. Make it a good kill.
Dragons, now, is it? Please, mother. If you keep on like this everyone in town will think you're crazy.
Drowning your troubles in mead? A lot of folks are doing that these days. You'll want the Windpeak Inn.
Either leave Valenwood, or he'd have me thrown into jail. Gave me a day to say my goodbyes to everyone.
Etienne, he's talked, hasn't he? He knows where that old man is you're looking for, he told me himself.
Excellent. I'd suggest that we go retrieve it immediately, but right now we have more pressing matters.
First off, it seems that we might be able to blackmail the Jarl's Steward. I need to find out for sure.
First Torygg and now Elisif. Damn those Stormcloaks. Let's hope that Erikur fares better than they did.
For hundreds of years it's been shut away from the world. Septimus was a useful tool for unleashing it.
For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity.
Go get her! At least she's bound to follow you back - you smell just like the fermented feed she likes.
Half of Skyrim knows. Old hag gets butchered in her own orphanage? Things like that tend to get around.
Halt, outlander. By the Code of Malacath, this stronghold belongs to the Orcs. Your kind are unwelcome.
He he he he he he he. The real question is, [QUOTE]Would someone pay to have me killed... again.[QUOTE]
He would lie in bed, paralyzed with fear, imagining his own nightmares coming to life. Ooohhh... Scary.
Hjalti? I've never heard of anyone named Hjalti. Tiber Septim had many names. Maybe that's one of them?
I am a loyal citizen of the Empire. My parents were Legionnaires, and I've followed in their footsteps.
I am Lu'ah Al-Skaven. Who are you to disrupt my work? Begone, or I will add you to my army of the dead!
I am under no obligation to tell you anything. Now, leave me at once and never mention that you saw me.
I assure you, I have nothing of value. I'm nothing but a poor woodcutter just trying to make ends meet.
I avoid going to Eastmarch if I can. Something in the air... I think it's just too close to the border.
I can't take it anymore, Tythis. Indaryn keeps pushing me around and I'm not even doing anything wrong.
I can't thank you enough. Here, take this. It's not much, but please accept it as a token of my thanks.
I do not know how he came to be caught. But the bronjun... the Jarl... was very proud of his pet. Paak!
I don't know. When I asked her where she was going she just muttered [QUOTE]Where the end began.[QUOTE]
I don't really have a mind for war, and I think he likes having an untrained opinion from time to time.
I fear this truce will not last. You gave the Empire too much. Ulfric will not let that stand for long.
I had Vald meet the caravan from Winterhold on the western end of the lake so he could avoid the roads.
I hail from Cyrodiil, but after a... misunderstanding with the law, I needed a swift change of scenery.
I have the greatest respect for the Greybeards, of course. And the dragon attacks are a growing plague.
I hear there's been fighting in Skyrim. Rebellion, maybe. Wonder if our iron is being used for weapons.
I hereby grant you permission to purchase property in my city. Talk to my steward if you're interested.
I hope you're having a good time. Actually, I hope I'm having a good time. I could care less about you.
I know what path you set her on. And now Paarthurnax's wisdom is lost to us, just when we need it most.
I know what path you set him on. And now Paarthurnax's wisdom is lost to us, just when we need it most.
I mean of course you will. You can tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
I mean, I'd hate to leave now and find out later you met some horrible fate at the hands of the Caller.
I mostly deal with petty thievery and drunken brawls. Been too long since we've had a good bandit raid.
I prefer to arrive early. Often the day before the party. So as not to miss out on any of the drinking.
I think it only fitting that the Arch-Mage personally receive a large portion of the reward. Well done.
I think you and I are worth about a dozen soldiers each. We'll send that beast back where it came from.
I understand this council was your idea, Dragonborn. I'm afraid I don't hold out much hope for success.
I was able to work out a deal with the stables in Whiterun to sell me some of their tack and harnesses.
I wonder that the Greybeards even notice what's going on down here. They haven't seemed to care before.
I would trust anyone here with my life, which is more than I'd say for the milk drinkers who raised me.
I'd rather spend more time in the mine hauling up iron then doing woman's work keeping the house clean.
I'll let Viarmo take possession but I will be looking forward to adding this to our library. Good work.
I'll make sure the Emperor himself hears of all you've accomplished. You've made Skyrim a better place.
I'll wager it was Ulfric himself that started the rumor. Maybe he thought it would bolster recruitment.
I'm setting him up with a new identity. It's the only way to throw the guard permanently off his trail.
I've battled next to every man and woman here, and the bonds of sweat are stronger than those of blood.
I've never admitted this before, but I've killed more than I care to admit. I'll just leave it at that.
I've tried to convince her the festival is many centuries old and celebrates Solitude but I need proof.
If he were to be crowned High King, I'm not so certain it would be the golden age his followers expect.
If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would have come true. She honors us all.
If that means breaking into their strongboxes and stealing something valuable from them, then so be it.
If the Dark Brotherhood discovered I had been a Morang Tong, they would come after me with a vengeance.
If you need any alchemy supplies, I'll do my best to provide them. Assuming I haven't used them all up.
If you really are Dragonborn, that is. Before I tell you any more, I need to make sure I can trust you.
If you were willing to retrieve him for me I'd give you some fresh meat to attract him out on the road.
If you would have asked me that yesterday, I'd have said no. But now I think our chances have improved.
If you're heading to Kynesgrove, stick to the road. Some pretty dangerous caves between here and there.
If you're here for sight-seeing, well then you've seen the sights. Might as well head somewhere warmer.
In fact, thieves have been known to kill, if there's a profit in it. This war's been hard on all of us.
Indeed. Avanchnzel is as much a library as it is a city. Built to hold the vast memories of the Dwemer.
Indeed. Orin brit ro. I cannot leave here until you defeat Alduin, which you cannot do without my help.
It is large, indeed. I did not anticipate Avanchnzel's size or the time needed to uncover the entrance.
It was an old Nord proverb. It said, the best way to get over the loss of a lover is to find a new one.
It was you who fought a dying Empire who sunk its claws into our land, trying to drag us down with it. 
It's a shame the Black-Briar Meadery took this place over. I never liked it as much as our Honningbrew.
It's appreciated. The captains around here will have one less thing to worry about. Here's your reward.
It's not about the coin, it's about honoring your legacy by picking up arms and keeping this land free.
It's not enough that you've stolen the spotlight with this Eye thing, now you're looking for the Augur?
It's not my fault they turned their backs on the Empire, or their mule of a son raised arms against it.
Just yesterday, I saw a musician in the street playing a flute. It was... beautiful. I want that flute.
Let this whole thing blow over, you know. Give certain parties a chance to forget what I may have done.
Let's not jump to conclusions. We'll do all the research we need to figure out what we're dealing with.
Long have you slept the dreamless sleep of death, Potema. No longer. Hear us Wolf Queen! We Summon You!
Look at my temple, lying in ruins. So much for the constancy of mortals, their crafts and their hearts.
Look, call me crazy if you like, but I trust Karliah. I don't think she'd lead us down a suicidal path.
Look, I can't make the coin appear out of thin air. Please, be reasonable. I'll... I'll pay next month.
Lot krongrah. You truly have the Voice of a dovah. Alduin's allies will think twice after this victory.
Luckily they don't know who he really is, or he wouldn't be serving drinks at the Ambassador's parties.
Maven and I spent weeks planning this. All we need is someone like you to get in there and get it done.
Maven and I worked out a little deal. If Sabjorn ends up in jail, she's going to take over his meadery.
Might head down to the meadery later. See what they're brewing up. You can smell the honey on the wind.
Mjoll told me that it isn't this bad everywhere. Maybe one day I'll venture out and see if she's right.
Mother's calling me. It's time for me to sleep now. I'm so tired. Thank you for making her feel better.
My brother, Thorald. He was fighting for the Stormcloaks, and went missing. Everyone assumes he's dead.
My friend Olava? The seer? She says things will get better for me, once I start sticking up for myself.
My job? Well, I'm the Watcher of the Wheel! Which is... exactly what it sounds like. I watch the Wheel.
My people, the Dunmer, built it. We fled from Morrowind after Vvardenfell erupted almost 200 years ago.
New in town, right? If you need a place to sleep, head over to the Winking Skeever. We keep a fine inn.
Next time you decide to pull a stunt like that again, just remember how much it hurt to give this away.
No one's been hurt yet, and they seem to be staying in the mine, but who knows how long that will last?
No, all my research points in the opposite direction. This is the exact liquid the priests would drink.
No, certainly not. A small experiment may have gone awry, but clearly with no discernable consequences.
No, just check in the guests and manage the coin and keep a roof over your head. No, nothing important.
No? Well, if you think you're capable of it, then I'd be happy to provide it to you for a mere 30 gold.
Not here. Definitely not here. You want to learn, join the College in Winterhold. They'll deal with it.
Not much exciting happens around here. You're as like as not to be bored to death if you stay too long.
Now I've got the itch to travel again. If you're leaving town, I wouldn't mind coming with for a while.
Now that it's upon us, I'm rather looking forward to the challenge. I'll be famouser than Olaf One-Eye!
Now, leave me. I don't want to arouse suspicion by talking to someone that clearly doesn't belong here.
Of course she is. I hear the mining business is extremely cutthroat. And those hours... they're murder.
Of course. Don't forget to keep out of sight, it doesn't count if they catch you red-handed. You ready?
Oh my... that's the worst one yet. How about we stop talking and keep our eyes open like Gulum-Ei said?
Oh, of course, the poor girl who was murdered. Such a beautiful young thing... a tragedy to be certain.
Oh, very brisk. When the snow sets in, even the hardiest Nord needs some spiced wine to warm the blood.
Oh, you've saved me! Thank you so much. Who knows what they'd have done to me if you hadn't come along.
Oh... lovely. Now all my dear Pelagius has to worry about are the several hundred legitimate threats...
On threat of what, exactly? This city wouldn't run without me! Now if you'll excuse me, my work awaits.
Perhaps it used to. But I'll never know. Hircine didn't care for my taking it, and threw a curse on it.
Petty threats and fist waving are not going to sway me. You people are all talk, and everyone knows it!
Pfft, I should've guessed as much. Your kind sticks to that College in Winterhold, as well they should.
Pleased enough to justify the significant amount of gold offered to the College to rectify the problem.
Save the niceties for now. I have no intention of getting invested in someone who may be dead tomorrow.
She wishes to speak to you herself. Please. Place your hands on the altar, and you will hear her voice.
She's threatened by me! By my skill as a wizard, by my elegance and posture, by my superior good looks!
Shor's favor found me today. Let's lift a mug of mead together, our wounds to salve and weariness cure.
Someday I'll be Jarl. Mother reminds me often. I hope I can help the people of Morthal the way she has.
Somewhat, yes. At first it seemed a distant thing, heard only in the idle speech of guards and traders.
Sorry, I thought Skald the Elder sent you. We've got an order to fill, and he's not known for patience.
Splendid! If you'll just follow me, I'll tell you tales and show you wonders such as you've never seen.
Still, you've gotten me out of that cage, and I won't forget it. Thank you again, and good luck to you.
Stormcloaks or Imperials. Either way, all they want is everything for free and you to lick their boots.
Suit yourself, but you better decide what you want to do about this arrest. No one walks away for free.
Teeba-Ei the hatchling never imagined working a mine in this cold place. Greater things were dreamt of.
Tell Delvin that if he still desires to have my support for the Thieves Guild in Windhelm, he's got it.
That's all right. I can teach you a very basic ward, one that's enough for the purposes of this lesson.
That's right, at least according to them scholars. Stonework's clearly not Nord, that much is for sure.
That's right. Whole group of the natives called the Forsworn rose up against the Nords. Drove them out.
The court wizard of Markarth, Calcelmo, may have the materials you need to get this journal translated.
The Empire is fortunate to have the support of the Thalmor during this difficult time, don't you think?
The festival would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our latest applicant.
The ivory produced by those beasts is as hard as iron. But the giants have found ways to make it yield.
The Keeper will be arriving soon, with the body of the Night Mother. So many preparations to be made...
The only reason I stopped fighting was a plea from Laila, otherwise I'd would have fought to the death.
The trade routes are affected as well. Procuring supplies is a guessing game. Weapons sell well though.
The wizards called it the Quill of Gemination and demanded a tremendous amount of gold to have it made.
There are words spoken, and words unspoken. Beware these Thalmor, for they are adept in both languages.
There is no retribution in the hunt. It is not vengeance I seek, but the blood course of a living hunt.
There's not many people left in Winterhold, so I only have Assur to play with, and sometimes he's mean.
They believed that if and when we found a Dragonborn, we would need to protect her against the Thalmor.
They believed that if and when we found a Dragonborn, we would need to protect him against the Thalmor.
They'll be gone as soon as they've found whoever they're looking for. And we'll have all the more coin.
This brings back memories. Come back when you're done and maybe I'll be up to showing you a few tricks.
This could be even more dangerous than I thought. Head to the ships. We'll plan the assault on the way.
This is only a taste of the benefits that accrue to those that align themselves with Thalmor interests.
This is the prayer heard by the goddess and relayed to her servants. Return when she has seen her path.
Those around you will perceive you as normal and you will find the words you utter may not be your own.
Those Battle-Born... they're in with the Imperials. They know it too, and yet they lie to my very face!
To be counted in that line is a bit of immortality. Even if I never see Sovngarde, I'll have that much.
To hear Vignar tell it, they're a bunch of layabouts and useless whiners who used to know how to fight.
Ulfric Stormcloak? The rightful High King? That's bordering on treason, man! Stand up. Stand up, I say!
Until then, let me offer you a warning. Beware the Forsworn. No place in the Reach is safe from us now.
We can't afford to give Paarthurnax the opportunity to betray us in turn, and return to his old master.
We don't even know their base of operations, and attacking single ships won't really solve the problem.
We seem to have run out of Colovian brandy. I'll check in the wine cellar for more when I get a moment.
We'll be ready, don't worry. You do have a plan for actually luring a dragon into this trap, don't you?
We're bound to find some gold in these ruins, but out of respect, let's leave a few coins for the dead.
We're stretched thin in Solitude, and I don't expect these bandits to be much challenge. Are you ready?
We've got an old saying -- the Gray-Manes have lived in Whiterun since the first snows fell in Skyrim. 
Welcome, my sister. Welcome to our Sanctuary. You have made the right choice, joining us, I assure you.
Well, if you had learned to swing it correctly. A sword is an extension of the arm, not a meat cleaver.
What more could I ask of you? No, you're free to roam. I suspect the gods have needs for you elsewhere.
What've you been staring at your feet this whole time? You see that big city up ahead of you? Markarth?
When I arrived, Gallus stepped from the shadows. Before he uttered a sound an arrow pierced his throat.
Why don't you come in? You can browse the displays, and we can talk. I have a job you look perfect for.
Why? There's nothing to discuss as long as that traitor Ulfric is in arms against his rightful Emperor.
Without boring you with the, ahh, details, I am attempting to re-create the circumstances of the event.
Would your good friend be named Jon, by any chance? I've spied the two of you talking quite intimately.
Wuunferth shall be apprehended. I thank you for your diligence in getting to the bottom of this matter.
Yes, actually. How about you smith me an iron dagger? Here's everything you need to make one. Go ahead.
You behave like you're carousing in a house of ill repute, not the residence of the Thalmor Ambassador!
You don't remember me, Hjalti? Two campaigns we served together. You saved my life time and time again.
You have quite the bounty on your head in Hjaalmarch. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. 
You have quite the bounty on your head in Winterhold. You pay me, and I see that your name is cleared. 
You kill me and your only contact with the East Empire Company vanishes. That's not smart for business.
You know I can't agree to these terms. The Emperor would repudiate this treaty and I would be recalled.
You mean... there's still a chance? But how? Our plan has gone to ruin, everyone is dead, the Family...
You might just make it. But for now, you're still a whelp to us, new blood. So you do what we tell you.
You would not come all this way for tinvaak with an old dovah. No. You seek your weapon against Alduin.
You? A servant of the King of Corruption? Has the beast's standards fallen so far? Tell me another one.
You'll just have to wait until after the captain's finished. I suppose you can wait around if you must.
You're making waves around here. I like that. If you ever want to talk about anything, you let me know.
You're welcome to take a look around Sabjorn's office. He keeps most of his papers stashed in his desk.
You're working with the Daedra? Right. Now tell me the one about the Argonian Maid and the lusty baron.
Your destiny requires you to use your Voice - why else would Akatosh have bestowed this power upon you?
Your solo performance is about a week away. I expect to hear your early rendition tomorrow, understand?
...madness is merry, and merriment's might, when the jester comes calling with his knife in the night...
[QUOTE]Forgiveness is the heart of Mara's blessings.[QUOTE] Very well. We shall re-arrange your wedding.
[QUOTE]Olaf gave orders, Winterhold disguises. An attack on Solitude total destruction to follow.[QUOTE]
A mage is only as good as what he knows. I try and make sure as much knowledge is available as possible.
A word of warning. Calcelmo is a fierce guardian of his research. Getting the information won't be easy.
Ah, now that is a good question. Where does Hogni get the finest, freshest meat from all over the Reach?
Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true... well, it changes the situation doesn't it?
And now the Stormcloaks have claimed the entire city. I guess we have Roggvir to thank for that as well.
And so Alduin's lordship passes to you. Thuri, Dovahkiin. I gladly submit to your mastery of the Thu'um.
Any information as to the whereabouts of the previous group of Apprentices would be greatly appreciated.
As promised, here's your payment for bringing them to me. Got it as part of a fair trade from my client.
As strange as it sounds, we'd be dead if not for that dragon. In the confusion, we managed to slip away.
At present, these two groups do little beyond attempting to gain the attention and favor of the Emperor.
Auxiliary, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting.
Back to Markarth with you! Virane must be silenced! He's a potential witness, you witless dagger jabber!
Be wary what you say around here, friend. You'll find not all take kindly to [QUOTE]insurrection.[QUOTE]
Been about eight years now. I used to be a mercenary, but one trip to Ravenscar Hollow cured me of that.
Begging your pardon milady... I know these have something to do with Dibella, but whatever are they for?
Bribing me? Well, a bard does need to eat. On my ancestor's honor, I won't trouble sweet Carlotta again.
Brynjolf's been looking for you. He wants to discuss the Guild Master ceremony. Congratulations... boss.
But I accepted the Dragonborn's invitation to this council, and I at least will negotiate in good faith.
But I am Al-du-in, Firstborn of Akatosh! Mulaagi zok lot! I cannot be slain here, by you or anyone else!
But I don't need some mythical Dragonborn. Someone who can put down a dragon is more than enough for me.
But my little Aethra didn't want to see her papa leave her. She pleaded to the Jarl to take her instead.
But once Alduin is defeated - then it will be the Empire's turn. Remember - [QUOTE]Evgir Unslaad.[QUOTE]
But the Elder Scrolls... they look left and right in the stream of time. The future and past are as one.
But you probably wanted to know about the fancy carvings and stonework, didn't you? Travelers always do.
But you're alive! So there's still a chance. A chance to start over, rebuild. That's why I did... this. 
But, mother... this is quite a sizable contribution and the crime doesn't befit such a harsh punishment.
Camilla, really? You don't have better things to do? Because I could certainly find quite a few tasks...
Can't be too careful these days, with the war and other dangers. For a fair price, I'll watch your back.
Come to me with questions. I know our history almost as well as Vignar by now. Except I can remember it.
Did you know Vittoria's getting married? They say the Emperor might even come to Skyrim for the wedding!
Do you have no better reason for acting than destiny? Are you nothing but a plaything of dez... of fate?
Don't mistake my tone for displeasure, after all, you've obediently performed your duties to the letter.
Drunk again, Embry? Don't let Alvor hear you talking to me that way. He'll stick your head in his forge.
Even now, my court wizard, Farengar, continues his research into ways we might drive back these terrors.
Everyone knows General Tullius wields the real power Solitude. Elisif? Ah, she's a figurehead. A puppet.
Everything in here seems to be about death. Burial urns, crypts, funeral shrouds. It's a bit depressing.
Excellent work, soldier. I have to admit, I had my doubts it even existed. Did you run into any trouble?
Excellent! Sorry it didn't work out with you and your lady. I know how excited you were for the wedding.
Excellent! These things do have a way of working out when people take action. I'll sanctify the remains.
Excellent. Now, you must come with me. You've become a part of this. You must be present for the ritual.
Fight with us and you'll have stories to tell. Come up to Jorrvaskr if you're worth anything in a fight.
Find Mzark and its sky-dome. The machinations there will read the Scroll and lay the lore upon the cube.
From the moment you were struck with my poisoned arrow at Snow Veil Sanctum, my path changed its course.
General Tullius needs more money for the war effort. We need the funds to arm and provision more troops.
Give it here. They've asked for the utmost discretion on this matter, so I'll make sure it gets to them.
Have you heard of the Blessing of Dibella? It can help you with the wooing of women, if that's your aim.
He uses all of Haafingar's resources, and doesn't answer to me in the slightest? This hardly seems fair.
He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Hardly ever leaves the place - has someone bring him food and such.
Head to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun and look for Mallus Maccius. He'll fill you in on all the details.
Hello, captain! Can you spare a moment? I heard something the other day that I wanted to share with you.
Hey, Svana... I hear you like Dark Elves. Perhaps I could should you what a real Dark Elf can do to you.
Hmm? Did you say snakes? Where? I hate them, always slithering they way they do... what? Are they on me?
Hmm. I guess that will have to do. You should pass for a real guest, at least until you open your mouth.
Hmm. Well now. This is all very fascinating, but I don't recall asking to you to touch anything in here.
I can't wait to see who succeeds Mirabelle. I've no doubt she'll be promoted to Arch-Mage at some point.
I dared speak of the Empire and the lies that have been spread by Ulfric, the leader of the Stormcloaks.
I do not have one in my possession. Nor do you, I'm sure. So we require a Daedra to retrieve one for us.
I don't abide fancy clothes, but you look like you might. I hear Radiant Raiments has a large selection.
I don't believe in getting my hands dirty. You have people that handle those sort of things... use them.
I don't care what you're doing, after what happened you're lucky I don't toss you in jail. Now get lost.
I don't care who you're with. After what you did, you're lucky I'm not cutting you down where you stand!
I don't know much about Morvunskar but it sounded like a lovely place for the ceremony. Congratulations.
I don't know why... but I actually believe you. You've got the look of someone who's just seen a dragon.
I don't know, but this place is full of them. Every one I've encountered has been enchanted or the like.
I fight for we few who did come home, only to find our country full of strangers wearing familiar faces.
I got a new order in for shields. I'm gonna need some hardwood planks. None of that soft pine this time.
I guess I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although I'm starting to doubt your fairness.
I guess... I'll hold down the fort by my lonesome. Hurry back and tell them to send a garrison. Quickly!
I hate it here. Those were my favorite shoes, ruined and for what? We never even made it to the wedding.
I have to move on if I want to find her. Please, take the coin I promised. Blessings of Stendarr on you!
I haven't told him anything, of course. What I'm doing is far too important. Can't breathe a word of it.
I know the High King invited them here, but he didn't ask me or anyone else first. Maybe he should have.
I mean, I've... taken care of many people for her in the past. What in Oblivion did she expect me to do?
I must have collapsed, because the next thing I remember is Aerin standing over me tending to my wounds.
I need to send someone out to do a little recruiting. There's someone in particular I'd like to join us.
I need you to take a case of mead to the Frozen Hearth in Winterhold. The delivery fee is yours to keep.
I never knew my mother, but I doubt even she acted as affectionate with my father as Yatul and Bolar do.
I suppose that risk always coexisted with his line of work, I just never thought his luck would run out.
I think of Uglarz. An old friend. When we were little she ran to the woods to hunt, and never came back.
I think you may have joined the wrong side. You showed yourself to be a true friend to the Empire today.
I told her it was a bad idea, that she wasn't cut out for what'd be necessary, but she wouldn't hear it.
I was a different man, once -- strong, commanding, ah, and young. But the Great War was a long time ago.
I will wait for Loreius! Oh yes, mother and I will wait right here, right here until he fixes our wheel.
I'm betting he acted as a go-between for the sale of Goldenglow Estate and that he can finger our buyer.
I'm sorry Enthir, I can't say. All that matters is we deliver your translation to the Guild immediately.
I'm telling you, it works. Let them ring their own ears on my shield, then scoop them up off the ground.
I've been adventuring across Tamriel since I was a fresh-faced young woman barely able to swing a blade.
I've got all sorts of interesting things for you to buy, and I assure you they're of the finest quality.
I've had this bow almost my entire life, and it's never let me down. I hope it brings you the same luck.
If I told you that, I'd be lying. We haven't had a bite in weeks. Our clients are starting to get angry.
If they choose to fear me in their ignorance, that is their choice. But it will not change what is true.
If you could give me a healing potion, I could cleanse this poison from my body and get back to my life.
If you remember to use your Voice in service to the purpose of Akatosh, you will remain true to the Way.
If you're looking for any archery or fletching supplies, you should see Fihada. I'm just the apprentice.
If your will is strong enough, it will stir Boethiah in her Dark Mansion, and she will appear before us.
In order for us to receive our abilities... our end of the bargain, I'm afraid the Key must be returned.
Instead of being clouded with thoughts of revenge and retribution, I feel only serenity and fulfillment.
Is there somewhere we can talk? There's no telling when the news from Helgen will reach the Imperials...
Isn't it obvious? As the Night Mother's Keeper, he believes he's entitled to the rule of this Sanctuary.
It is called [QUOTE]Force[QUOTE] in your tongue. But as you push the world, so does the world push back.
It's nice to be rid of that detestable dog. Things are so much more fun without his incessant preaching.
It's really great we're friends. I was hoping to find some way to thank you. I hope this does the trick.
Keep digging! Ugh... If Lu'ah Al-Skaven can raise an army of Draugr, then why do I have to babysit them?
Last thing the Black-Briars need around here is some troublemaker tryin' to steal a piece of the action.
Let me show you where they are. Maybe they welcome you. Maybe they put an arrow in your face. Who knows?
Linwe is holed up at a place called Uttering Hills Cave. He's got his entire Guild there, so be careful.
Looks like nobody here knows what's happened yet. Come on. Gerdur's probably working in her lumber mill.
Men are complete pigs, am I right? All they care about is one thing... and you know exactly what I mean.
Miss Stentor, these are quite expensive. I trust you know how limited the hold's funds are at this time?
Mostly food supplies like dried fish and salted meats; you know, things that keep fresh for a long time.
No, and I'm not about to either. I value my life you know... you may want to remember that for yourself.
No, but that won't account for the size issue. Blast, if only so many of these creatures hadn't escaped.
Not within society, no. Many who practice within the school of Conjuration do so on their own, secretly.
Now, take Shagrol's hammer back to Largashbur, and we'll see about whipping the rest of them into shape.
Of course, you could just run him through and take what you need off of his corpse... I could care less.
Oh, all right then, Listener. Cicero will just carry on with what he was doing. Until you say otherwise.
Oh, don't worry too much about it. They were all whelps once. They just might not like to talk about it.
Oh... Oh no... Please, please... I ain't never harmed no one... Old Narfi just wants to be left alone...
Oh... perhaps not, then. I don't think the Jarl of Solitude should be participating in a childish prank.
Okay. I'll get this inside the Embassy for you. I've got to go. I'll find you at the party, don't worry.
On the one hand, supplies are harder to come by, since fewer traders are traveling the roads these days.
Once the Skeleton Key has been restored to the Twilight Sepulcher, I'll make this place my home as well.
One block lifts the other. Septimus will give what you want, but you must bring him something in return.
One day, she just disappeared. Ranmir was convinced she'd run off with someone else, leaving him behind.
Onmund, please search that area over there. See if you notice any... residual energies. Alive or undead.
Perhaps it's because there's no better way to face the cold Skyrim nights than with a belly full of ale?
Personally, I've always found Argonians to be incredibly unpredictable opponents. Especially near water.
Pfft. You'd think an emperor would fetch at least twice that. Damn that motherless cheapskate, Motierre.
Please, don't get rid of me! I need the coin. I... I'll work for free for the rest of this week. Please!
Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.
Preparing the defenses is almost impossible lately, every time we get a new war report our needs change.
Pretty simple. Break into a house, grab a specific item and get out before they realize what's going on.
Put down your flagons filled with your vile liquids and embrace the teachings of the handmaiden of Kyne.
Seen some mean-spirited folk pass through lately. Thought I was rid of those sorts when I left Markarth.
She said she'll have it soon. She still has her job at the meadery for now, so she'll be able to pay us.
She said that she barely had enough coin to cover it and I should come back later. Can you imagine that?
Shh. You mustn't speak about such things away from the shrine. Only you and your dinner guests can know.
Sigh. Everyone isn't as short as you are... what good are these boards to someone of the proper height!?
Sir, we can't just keep trading blows with the rebels like this - it's only strengthening their resolve.
So says you. I think I've hit my limit on these things. Tell you what, one more and you win the contest.
So the disgusting pig sent you to bother me? One day, I'll tear his face apart so he can leave me alone.
So, it is done. Alduin dilon. The Eldest is no more, he who came before all others, and has always been.
So, life has brought you to Morthal, and to me. What purpose this serves, we will no doubt see. Welcome.
So, uh... how is Astrid doing' these days? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up.
Some think it's superstition, but I believe it works. I've yet to have a giant kill any of my livestock.
Splendid! With the extra coin, I'll be able to purchase twice the volume in supplies that I normally do.
Steward, when is my appointment to meet with General Tullius? There are some issues we must speak about.
Take care of yourself, and always remember: the world is ripe with people looking to spill your blood...
Tendrils of thought may wind their way through this realm, but those tendrils bind our reality together.
That's what many here wanted. A quiet life in a quiet place, without the noise or the trouble of a city.
The approach to Riften is guarded by watchtowers. They will be full of archers. Move fast, and stay low.
The attack will be launched imminently. Gather your weaponry and get to the front lines... Now, soldier!
The Blackblood girl? Now there was a fighter. If I didn't know better, I'd say she was a Forsworn woman.
The College of Winterhold is an amazing sight. I've never set foot on the grounds, but always wanted to.
The Empire can live with these terms, yes. For a temporary truce, until the dragon menace is dealt with.
The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it will take you to meet him once more.
The Silver-Bloods pay me, let me crack a few skulls, and keep the guards off my back. That's all I need.
The simplest way to put it is [QUOTE]knowledge,[QUOTE] but there's nothing simple about an Elder Scroll.
There's only one way to find out if what the lass says is true. Delvin, I'll need you to open the Vault.
These people just inherited some heirlooms from a relative. Good timing for us, bad timing for them, eh?
These Thalmor might not like to admit it, but as long as the Empire has Skyrim, the Empire has strength.
Think of the way force may be applied effortlessly. Imagine but a whisper pushing aside all in its path.
This little adventure of yours has cost me a number of test subjects. I need more, and you'll do nicely.
Together we're going to stop these dragons, if we have to put every last one of them back in the ground.
True. But few now remember that this was the very spot where Alduin was defeated by the ancient Tongues.
Uh... that's right. We saw it coming from the south. It was fast... faster than anything I've ever seen.
Ulfric, why so hostile? After all, it's not the Thalmor that's burning your farms and killing your sons.
We do this in secret because Kodlak is too busy trying to throw away this great gift we've been granted.
We have not faired well outside our native Black Marsh, but we're determined to make the best of things.
We know that Shalidor had an understanding of magic that surpassed almost any of either his age or ours.
We raided a caravan one spring... I think it was a few wagons with some farmers moving to a new village.
We're there for information, remember? Trust me, I've been doing this for a long time. My way is better.
Welcome, my brother. Welcome to our Sanctuary. You have made the right choice, joining us, I assure you.
What of it, he says. Your Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos.
What? You're out of your mind. That old coot's more interested in dead dwarves than anybody around here.
When my daughter Lash chose to leave the stronghold, I forged a sword to channel all my shame and grief.
Why are you still here? You're supposed to be at Korvanjund, proving Galmar right, or proving him wrong.
Word on the street is that poor Sabjorn has found himself in Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.
Yes, I could use some help with that. An assistant perhaps? No, no, no. Maybe a familiar. No, too messy.
Yes, I've heard the Guild is rising back to power. An alliance would be most beneficial to both parties.
Yes, of course, but Ulfric's message is a powerful one. More of our people flock to his cause every day.
Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking. I'm not a Nord, I'm a Breton, and I have no wish to fight this war.
Yes. I've heard stories that Old Hroldan was haunted, but no ones seen a ghost here since the Great War.
You and I are alike. We seek challenge and great fortune. But for me, that's where the similarities end.
You can return this axe to the man who sent it. And tell him he should prepare to entertain... visitors.
You dropped this. Good thing I found it and not someone else, otherwise you might have lost it for good.
You have a death wish, then? If you know that name, you must know to meet him would be to meet your end.
You healed the wounded, Nura. You saw their life's blood spilling into the mud, giving back to the land.
You might want to rethink that. You're missing out on some wonderful opportunities, working in that bar.
You must have me mistaken for someone else. I am Elisif, widow of High King Torygg and Jarl of Solitude.
You promised me, Hjalti. You promised that when we sacked Hroldan, you would make me your sworn brother.
You two, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Stormcloak reinforcements taking us by surprise.
You were charged with keeping us inside the walls. Have faith, Ugor. I only wish the best for our tribe.
You will be called on to take swift action. Rise to the challenge, and discover what you are capable of.
You will release me - ro laan - if in return I promise to take you to Skuldafn and stop helping Alduin? 
You wish to leave now? In Skyrim's moment of triumph, just before we cast off the yoke of Imperial rule?
You would do that? It's good to know there are some people out there who are willing to help an old man.
You're the one who returned blessed Sheogorath. I would be honored to be Wabbajacked by you, your grace.
You've actually done it. You've found the Sybil of Dibella. You have done Markarth a tremendous service.
Your job would be to change the numbers in those books so the shortfalls from our other jobs look legit.
Ysmir's beard, you're right! No fish was ever caught by staying away from the shore. I'm off to see her!
[QUOTE]Windhelm's an easy posting![QUOTE] they said. Guess they didn't count on Ulfric's little uprising.
A navy, my lord. We could stop the influx of Imperial troops to Solitude, and choke their northern lines.
Agh! Bother and befuddle! Stuck here! Stuck! My mother, my poor mother. Unmoving. At rest, but too still!
Ah, yes, your pay. The Company thanks you for your services. Should we ever be able to help you, stop by.
Alduin? The World-Eater himself? But... how can we fight him? Doesn't his return mean it's the end times?
All I'm saying is Indaryn's going to push someone too far one day and they're going to push back... hard.
Although... it might be difficult to persuade the Jarl to allow you to use his palace as a dragon trap...
And you can trust me. Zu'u ni tahrodiis. Alduin has proven himself unworthy to rule. I go my own way now.
Any and all theories are currently being considered. Those with ideas should please speak with Mirabelle.
Arrogance will serve you poorly. Your worth must be determined before knowledge can be bestowed upon you.
As a result, we both feel that you have the potential of replacing Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild.
As I recall, Yisra was trying to improve flame cloak spells to better work in Skyrim's harsh environment.
As the sun ends the night, end the darkness of this soul, return life to the creature you see before you!
Best head up to Dragonsreach, then, and see the Jarl. He's lord of Whiterun, and can set you on the path.
Bring me whatever he's carrying, and I'll send you to Morthal with something convincing but full of lies.
Brynjolf finally got some dirt on the mark and the evidence to back it up. Think you can give him a hand?
But even the bravest of men consider their actions. I want you to survive long enough to take the mantle.
But I know that after you think about what you saw today, you'll realize that Skyrim deserves to be free.
But make no mistake, this is not a peace forged out of necessity between rival nations of equal strength.
But the Moot has not yet met to name her High Queen. And they won't. Not as long as I have any say in it.
But the truth of it is, I have a mountain of paperwork back in Windhelm and it's not getting any smaller.
But we are honorbound to fight it, even if we fail. This dragon is threatening our homes... our families.
By then, Burguk had already become chief, and he welcomed me home as family, not a rival as is tradition.
Calm down! Why are you over-reacting? I was going to ask if the two of you are collaborating on research!
Carrying around a weight like that... it hurts after a while. Cuts you inside like a dagger to the heart.
Come now. You'll want to show up in Sovngarde refreshed. You got an eternity of merrimakin' ahead of you.
Come see me in Windhelm when this is all done. There's always work for those willing to fight for Skyrim.
Consider it a gift to ensure your silence. That thing seems to be bringing me nothing but trouble anyway.
Contemplate the meaning of a Rotmulaag. You will become closer to that Word, as it fills your inner self.
Delphine really is alive, then? You'd better come in then and tell me how you found me and what you want.
Did you see those robes march in this morning? Who're they with? More of the Emissary's treaty enforcers?
Divines sake, Skald. Who do think we're threatening with our old war wounds? We're not soldiers, anymore.
Don't play dumb with me. Pay up, and you walk right through. Refuse, and you'll never see the other side.
Don't try blocking if you have two weapons. You will only get confused.  Much better to hit twice anyway.
Don't worry, my parties are always well-stocked with the finest food and drink available in this country.
Erandur, she has a point. You keep telling us no harm will follow these dreams, but they must be an omen.
Even if we had a prisoner by that name, the only way he'd be released is by order of the Imperial Legion.
Excellent news. Were it to have gotten out of hand, it could have become a major problem for the College.
Excellent. That's one less settlement in Imperial hands, and one more sign to all that our cause is true.
Fie. We beseech you. Darken this gem so that we may use its power to restore The Order of the Black Worm.
Forget Solitude or Windhelm. Whiterun was the crown jewel of Skyrim before... Well, before... Never mind.
Gadba and me came to work the mine. The plan is to get rich and then go back to Largashbur and take over!
General Tullius will never allow that. He's ordered all surplus food to be given over for the war effort.
Genius! And I'm sure you've completely worked out how to counteract complete dimensional collapse, right?
Good job! With those Imperial scouts out of the way, I can be more aggressive about where I send our men.
Good thing she makes so much money. Makes it easier for merchandise like this to fall through the cracks.
Good. Now remember - pain, and lots of it. But not to the death. If they arrest you, it's not my problem.
Hardly! In fact, I don't know how I get anything done with all of the distractions I have to put up with.
Have a house with a good bit of valuables inside, but one particular item's caught my eye. You up for it?
Have you by chance heard of the [QUOTE]Gourmet[QUOTE]? Read his cookbook? It's become quite a phenomenon.
Haven't you figured it out yet? What more needs to happen before you all wake up and see what's going on?
He did what had to be done. It was long overdue. My only regret is that I wasn't able to kill him myself.
He was too privileged and too foolish, more interested in entertaining his queen than ruling his country.
Here. Take this. You'll need it. Use it on the island. Don't lose it. That's all the help you're getting.
Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
Here's the sword. Tell Harrald to stop slaying walls and perhaps his blade will stay in better condition!
I can assure you, though, that it was quite something in its prime. An early capital of Skyrim, you know.
I can't say I blame them. Murder is not our way. Gallus was before my time, but I still can't believe it.
I do hope you know what your doing with those flames. It would be quite a shame if something caught fire.
I don't expect the three of you to fight off a dragon by yourselves. But I do expect you to do your duty.
I don't have much of a reputation in Skyrim yet, but I'm working on that, one sweet lady at a time. Haha!
I don't know about you, tekla, but all my prayers are silent and who I pray to is still my own to decide.
I don't know if anyone else got out alive. I doubt I'd have made it out myself if not for my friend here.
I don't know if I've ever seen any of those before. I've heard about them, though. Sorry, can't help you.
I don't know, Babette. Looks like he may have suffered a head wound. Best not let him out of our sight...
I don't see any reason why we'd need them. As long as those dogs stay outside of our borders, we're fine.
I expected better from you Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, despite your known Imperial sympathies.
I guess if you're telling me to stop worrying about it, maybe I should just let it go. Thank you, friend.
I have a contact inside the Embassy. He's not up for this kind of high-risk mission, but he can help you.
I have a few things laying around that weren't worth adding to the collection. You may look through them.
I hear you're in for life. Sad. I'd get a shiv if I was you, or maybe some Skooma to drown your troubles.
I heard about what you did at the Guild all the way out here. Sorry, can't buy or sell anything from you.
I heard those mages up in Winterhold have been trying to figure out how many dragons there are in Skyrim.
I just often don't have much to do, so I tend to... I try things out. They don't usually work, but I try.
I learned that a matron who had served for House Telvanni had escaped Morrowind during the Accession War.
I mean, it don't cost me anything to let you have one and the dead won't notice their stuff missing. heh.
I need you to make your way to Solitude and talk to Erikur. He's lookin' to run some kind of a shill job.
I never thought all I would want is peace and quiet, but I think our little adventure scared me straight.
I put it on... and the changes just came to me. I could never guess when. It would be at the worst times.
I really do need you to stay in place, please. I don't want to risk hurting any of the other Apprentices.
I shouldn't let you walk out of here, knowing what you know. But I guess even my paranoia has its limits.
I thought I was a goner just now. Thanks for the help, and if you need any supplies I have a few to sell.
I was a sorceress of no small skill before I came into Azura's faith. Afterwards, her magic sustained me.
I was once, but not any more. I was wounded in a skirmish up near Windhelm. This was years ago, mind you.
I was the newest Companion, until you came along. I guess that's ok. Just means I can show you the ropes!
I will make sure this finds its way to his tomb as soon as possible. Thank you for bringing it, my child.
I won't have you rob our soldiers of their chance to drive out the Empire. I'm done discussing this, Jod.
I work for them. The inn is named after them. When the guards make an arrest, they check with them first.
I wouldn't bother smacking at those hives with a weapon. Set 'em on fire and they'll go up like kindling.
I'm guessing you also don't remember coming in here and blathering incoherently about marriage or a goat.
I'm on my way to a giant camp and I can't guarantee those beasts won't think you're part of the offering.
I'm the Jarl's personal blacksmith, but that doesn't mean I can't sell you a few pieces for a fair price.
I'm trying to understand why I'm here, lass. I'm no priest, and I'm certainly not religious. Why pick me?
I'm worried that they'll come out of the mine looking for food soon... then we're in even bigger trouble.
I've been ridin' horses since I was a lad... nothin' I liked more. But as I got bigger, so did my mounts.
I've busted heads for Maven Black-Briar when she wants to keep her name out of it. Pays good, so why not?
I've got to stay here, to see if we can get to Ancano and stop this. I need someone I can trust to do it.
If it's horses you want, you'll want to speak to Hofgrir. I'm afraid I'm in too much trouble to help you.
If you can goad a target into attacking you first, you may even find any local guards coming to your aid.
If you confront her with three of the Marks, she'd be so embarrassed... well, I don't know what she'd do!
If you deal with Nimhe, I'll let you into both the excavation site and my Dwemer Museum. What do you say?
In trouble with the Guild, eh? Well, looks like we won't be trading merchandise until you smooth it over.
Is the line for my next performance starting already? Come on, don't be shy. Plenty of room for everyone.
It has been long since I held tinvaak with a stranger. I gave in to the temptation to prolong our speech.
It is more like the calm between storms. And the next storm, I think, will be far deadlier than the last.
It seems I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although I'm starting to doubt your fairness.
It turns out that if people think you're some sort of secret wizard, they'll let you get away with a lot.
It was a few years ago. A few of the mages got overconfident and were exiled. They had no talent, anyway.
It would seem Fort Dunstad is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those...
It's a well-known fact that the steward keeps all of the records on Whiterun's prisoners in a large book.
It's possible that there was less than the necessary amount of oversight. That's still being looked into.
It's true, Brynjolf. Every word. Mercer's been stealing from the Guild for years, right under your noses.
It's... Cicero. There's been an incident. You should proceed into the Sanctuary. I'll let Astrid explain.
J'zargo gives you plenty of these scrolls, so you try them and return when you can say whether they work.
Just follow my instructions, and the Dark Brotherhood will be back on top. All thanks to you... Listener.
Just one bottle per customer. Except for the man who saved the festival. Here's a couple bottles for you.
Karliah is the thief responsible for murdering the previous Guild Master, Gallus. Now she's after Mercer.
Legend holds that the Dancer's Pipe has won wars, toppled empires and changed the very course of history.
Legion soldiers gleam like fresh-fallen snow and clank like a kitchen. They head this way, we'll know it.
Look, I'm only telling you this because I care for her. Don't mistake this as acceptance for what you do.
Look, Shadr. Last warning. Pay up or else. All I care about is the gold. Everything else is your problem.
Magic? Goodness, not here! Nothing dangerous like that! That's all kept to that College up in Winterhold.
Malthyr told me that you've been speaking to Ulfric about our situation. He said you're going to help us.
Many of the Empire's troops were Nords at that point. Some of them could even have been from around here.
Many of the monumental ruins that still dot the landscape were, in fact, built as temples to the dragons.
Mara is the Goddess of Love. The temple spreads her gifts by tending to the sick, the poor, and the lost.
Mara's domain encompasses the emotions we strive the most to embrace; love, compassion and understanding.
Master Borri will teach you [QUOTE]Nah[QUOTE] - [QUOTE]Fury[QUOTE] - the second word of Whirlwind Sprint.
Mercer's been careful so far. I don't think he'd just leave those plans behind unless he had his reasons.
Mother, what can I do to make father happier? It seems no matter how successful I become he doesn't care.
My father never thought I was smart enough to be a stablemaster. I just wish he was around to see me now.
My knowledge of Skyrim's history is far from complete, but I did some research and discovered two things.
My sister and I both work for the Nords. Our brother is ashamed of us, but at least we can affort to eat.
My sources must remain a secret for their own protection but I can promise that the contents are genuine.
No, I need a name that will put some fear in the hearts of my enemies. When I have some enemies, that is.
No, she certainly wouldn't. And... for whatever reason, she chose to relay Motierre's information to you.
No! Please! I really don't have any money, Braith! I'll give you ten septims tomorrow. Just don't hit me.
Not enough to outweigh the loss of Riften. The whole south of Eastmarch would be open to Imperial attack.
Not exactly. The crown is what the Guild calls a paragon; an object that enhances our thieving abilities.
Not only did I they take my bow, but they took all of our coin as well. Nothing's sacred to these people.
Not only that, but these Nords have no love for us. They look upon us and see only thieves and smugglers.
Now if you'll excuse me. The East Empire Company has several accounts, and it's up to me to balance them.
Now that stability has been established between the Dominion and the Empire, we seek only to help Skyrim.
Now, to prove yourself to me, I have a task for you. Take my axe, and deliver it to the Jarl of Whiterun.
Oh I know. Isn't it wonderful? I bet she squirmed like a skeever when you pulled them out of your pocket.
Oh, it's you! Sorry to hear about your imprisonment. I'm sure the guards didn't mean to throw you in jail
Oh, you prefer to listen, eh? Of course, of course! The Listener listens! A joke! A funny joke! I get it.
Olaf returned in triumph to Whiterun. By his decree, the city's keep was rebuilt as a prison for Numinex.
Options were in short supply. Ranmir and I grew up here, and his drinking soaked up whatever coin we had.
People think they can run away from their crimes, but I will always catch up with them and make them pay.
Perhaps you could seek out these Convectors in Skyrim ruins? I can even teach you the spell to heat them.
Please, you can't leave me in here! If you let me out I can show you where they hide their best treasure.
Poor Horgeir. Everyone in town knows about his wife's affair but him. Probably better if he doesn't know.
Putting aside Ralston's Constant of Universal Inversion for a moment, how would you approach the problem?
Remember, the Sanctuary is in the southern Pine Forest. Just beneath the road, and away from prying eyes.
Sadly, most have fallen into disrepair. And nearly all have been overrun with bandits or other vagabonds.
Search Cicero's room. Maybe there's something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone.
See if you can drop in on this dealer of poison and convince him to close down his operation permanently.
Should you ever fall victim to an unfortunate accident, I promise your remains will be put to good use...
So now I'm stuck living here while those pigs she calls customers grope me and say the most awful things.
So the Jarl thinks you can be of use to me? Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons.
So your information was correct after all. And we have our friend here to thank for recovering it for us.
So, my fellow beast, what do you want? Answers about the Forsworn? Revenge for trying to have you killed?
So, you're finally going to make Guild Master, eh? Well, you better track down Brynjolf to seal the deal.
Some of them have a long way to go, but they're mostly passable. Don't let them hear I said that, though!
Sure, I understand. It's not easy to go from being executed by the Legion one day to joining up the next.
That remains to be seen. But if it is so, and if Boethiah appears, then we will welcome you as one of us.
That's because there's nothing to tell. He left us to fend for ourselves and that's all you need to know.
That's it? Sure. Shouldn't be too hard. I usually end up making a fool out of myself without even trying.
That's right. He is your son. He has his own hopes and dreams and we have no right to tell him otherwise.
That's the Honningbrew Meadery. Supposed to be a big rivalry between them and the Black-Briars of Riften.
The base broth is already boiled. We can get started right now. So... which ingredient should I add next?
The best tales are those of adventure. Who could truly write such a tale without first experiencing such?
The Gray-Manes have deep roots in Whiterun, but so do we. Difference is, we're rich, and Vignar hates it.
The idiot got lost in the mist and ran his boat right over some rocks, sending it straight to the bottom.
The Imperials were weak. They created this Forsworn problem, but now that we're in charge we'll solve it.
The Jarl would be wise to remember that it is her thanes - and my profits - that are paying for this war.
The money was good, and the women were good, and the drinks were good. But I was losing myself. My heart.
The Redoran contract? Yes, you heard correctly. In and out of Vvardenfell in less than forty eight hours.
The secret is my forge. It consumes fire salts, a strange mineral that burns as hot as Red Mountain lava.
The target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
The what? Why how dare you! I will not be intimidated in my own orphanage! Get out! Get out this instant!
Their fires lit up the night. All across Lake Rumare, like stars come to earth. It was beautiful, really.
Then I found that wretched poetry from Svana. When I confronted Sibbi about it, he threatened to kill me.
There were only three of us left. Takes-In-Light just sat down and gave up, and we left her there to die.
There's a new museum opening up in Dawnstar. The owner is asking me to hand out invitations to travelers.
There's also the matter of your payment. I believe you'll find this more than adequate for your services.
There's just one more thing I need from you. To fully absorb Gathrik's power I require a blood sacrifice.
These are the Guardian Stones, three of the thirteen ancient standing stones that dot Skyrim's landscape.
These Forsworn are just savages. They live in caves and ruins when civilized folk build towns and cities.
They already sing of your valor and skill! The halls of Sovngarde are no doubt ringing with your praises!
They're parasites. They're living in our city, under our protection, but what do they do for us? Nothing!
This should be lit up brighter than the night sky, and it's not! Clearly you've interfered somehow. Or...
Thongvor, I have the latest reports from Cidhna Mine and the smelter. We should go over them immediately.
Those eyes. All right, killer, go on through. But don't try anything. Madanach knows more than you think.
Ulfric prays for strength. I speak to Captain Lonely-Gale, but he doesn't spend much time here. Too busy.
Vacation is where the head is. That is what Dervenin told us about our master. He's cozy in his Solitude.
Vals Veran. My family has never really seen eye to eye with him and he has finally gone off the deep end.
Very true. In our line of work, it's quite rare we set out to return a stolen item to its rightful owner.
Vilkas said you are the new Kodlak. I don't know what that means, but you seem honorable, so that's good.
We are forged by Boethiah's example. We carve our will upon the world through our tongues and our blades.
We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like it has been for a thousand years.
We don't mistake that for acceptance, though. Odds are they're simply too afraid to confront us directly.
We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you and Eltrys started snooping around.
We tore each other to pieces. After it was over, those of us that remained simply went our separate ways.
We're taking Dawnstar. Get down there and join the rest of the men gathering for the attack. Now soldier!
We've got a long way to go, but don't let that bother you... it's a lot farther than we've been in years.
Welcome to the Bee and Barb, milady. If I can interest you in one of our special drinks, you let me know.
Welcome to the Bee and Barb, milord. If I can interest you in one of our special drinks, you let me know.
Well guess what... now you've inherited their debt. Don't come back to me until you have every last coin.
Well, I just did what had to be done. Nothing more. Nothing less. I'm just glad I lived to tell the tale.
Well, you clearly possess the minimum aptitude required. Congratulations. I'll escort you up to the gate.
Well, you see, the palace - Dragonsreach - was originally built to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name.
Well. I'll let it slide this time. But you'd be smart to take that off. Someone might get the wrong idea.
Well... I'd certainly love to have such a powerful staff, but I'm not really sure that any of us need it.
What of it, she says. Your Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos.
What? Oh, no. No, no. I need more time to research the dwarven machinery. Thank you for offering, though.
What? You want it for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers - don't you? I won't let her have you!
Whatever happened when you killed that dragon, it revealed something in you, and the Greybeards heard it.
When speaking of the Black-Briars, only one thought should spring to mind. We are not to be trifled with.
With my lock picking aptitude, I was a natural at jailbreaking... made a great deal of gold doing it too.
Wuuthrad was the blade held by Ysgramor when he cut through the elven hordes that once swarmed this land.
Yes, but that fool Endario can't get it in. I'll thrash him when I get back to the city, don't you worry.
Yes, I think that must be it. My wife hasn't been gone that long, after all. Ask me again on another day.
Yes, show yourself to us. Until that day, we will continue to devote our lives to you and suffer for you.
Yes, that's your mother's side of the family talking. Just stay on for one more season, that's all I ask.
Yes, well. Perhaps someone else in the village can assist you? Please, you're starting to... frighten me.
Yes. It all started when I was a boy. My father owned one of the mines. Rare for anyone who isn't a Nord.
Yes. This is a test. I don't think you're regular militia material. I want to see what you're capable of.
You can return this axe to our friend. The esteemed Jarl of Windhelm has my answer. Make sure he gets it.
You could take word to her that there'll be a shipment soon. Buy us some time and keep her off our backs.
You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat few manage and live to tell about it.
You heard of Ravenscar Hollow? Cave on the island to the west. Place is a roost for those foul Hagravens.
You just keep quiet and stay where you are. Soon as my relief arrives, we'll all take a nice little trip.
You like living in this filthy slum, dark elves? Maybe you should go back to Morrowind, where you belong!
You look like the adventurous sort. You should talk to Erik, the innkeeper's son. He could use your help.
You may think this war is nearly won. You're wrong. I've been fighting you with a mere handful of troops.
You sure you won't change your mind? Riverwood isn't far. I'm sure my uncle will be glad to help you out.
You want to keep helping? How about you make some armor? Let's start by tanning some leather on the rack.
You weren't nearly as successful as you think, fool. According to my scrying the Wolf Queen has returned.
You! You've got a lot of nerve showing yourself in this town again. What do you have to say for yourself?
You'll have to deal with the Hagravens. I've heard about a weapon they've made for sacrificing Spriggans.
You're going to love it here. We have a lot of fun, and we look out for each other. Just like any family.
You're the one that got out of Helgen, aren't you? I could use anyone who's tangled with a dragon before.
A delicate question, to be sure. I'm the Emperor's cousin, and the Empire has little love for the Thalmor.
A true killer, like me. The gods put us here to fill their halls with souls. You'll fit in fine down here.
Aela said we would need a Hagraven's head. I already have one of them, but she said it was a special kind.
Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice like these worthy gentlemen, but it is written here in this scroll.
Ah, kinsman. How my heart soars to look upon a brother Bosmer. Please, how can I serve your hunting needs?
Ah, Viarmo.  I assume you are here to petition for the reinstatement of the Burning of King Olaf Festival.
Ah, Yngvar, here to sing? You know an employee of the Silver-Blood family is always a guest of honor here.
All right, calm down, no need to for that. I'll let you in right away, just need to get the gate unlocked.
Alright, but if you ever want to leave that old curmudgeon I've got plenty for you to do at Gentle Repose.
And I'm sure he told you it was urgent. Well, he's not the only Jarl in Skyrim with problems to deal with.
Around here, you'll want to learn to live your own life. Remember, nobody rules anybody in the Companions.
At least, that's what I'm told it does... there hasn't been a paragon in this Guild for hundreds of years.
Atronachs have a tendency to frighten the locals. Undead.... well, I don't even think it needs to be said.
Aunt Haelga, why you... demean yourself with these people you barely know? They show no real love for you.
Bersi's afraid that someone's making a move to take the Pawned Prawn from us. I think he's being paranoid.
But even the Blades didn't see the Great War coming. We underestimated the Thalmor, and they destroyed us.
But he hands all the paperwork over to Nepos the Nose to finish. That old man's back is heavy with burden.
But I can't turn away a potential ally in these times. Let's see if you're better than a common mercenary.
But now it's too late for escape. The dragon is upon me - fire and darkness descending like a thunderbolt.
But only the Greybeards study the Way of the Voice any more. If you can Shout... you need to talk to them.
But really. A horker, some twine, three wood elves, and a hatchet? Points for creativity, if nothing else.
But there's no shame in it. One of them dragons comes callin' in Whiterun, the place'll go up like tinder.
But Ulfric was at that moot, continually talking about Skyrim's independence in terms just shy of treason.
But we both know this has little to do with honor and oaths and loyalty. It's about the reward; the prize.
Convince Loreius to fix my wheel! Do that, and poor Cicero will reward you. With coin! Gleamy, shiny coin!
Damn it, woman! Ingun is the most promising alchemist I've ever seen and I won't have you scaring her off!
Deal with problems head on. Leave whispers and sneaking to the gutter rats who can't fight for themselves.
Did I see you talking to Sven? Maybe not. Maybe...nevermind. But I would stay away from him if I were you.
Did I tell you I got a letter from General Tullius? They've conscripted some more archers and will need...
Don't know why you'd help a stranger like that, but a septim's a septim... don't care where it comes from.
Don't let the shop's name frighten you away. I have plenty of reliable tonics and healing potions to sell.
Every Argonian wedding proposal band is supposed to have three flawless amethysts as part of their design.
Exile or no, my duty to Balgruuf remains. Keep that in mind when you approach him, for I will be watching.
Fine. Don't tell me. But I know that look in your eyes. Someone who's faced death at the hands of the law.
For not even the strongest machinations of the Dwemer can hold off the all-sight given by an Elder Scroll.
Forgive me for my hasty opinion of you, I see that I was wrong and that there's much I can learn from you.
Give me what you can't live without, and I'll make sure to get it into the Embassy. The rest is up to you.
Go and tell Erik that I've changed my mind. I'll see about borrowing some money in Whiterun for his armor.
Goldenglow Estate brought in a mountain of gold for the Guild. You could almost call it our sweetest deal.
Good. And I hope you were careful in that lumber mill. Those splinters and rusty nails can be quite nasty.
Got a problem with a prisoner? Get a shiv. Hear Grisvar has a spare, if you could get him to part with it.
He has returned... Oh, how Talos has returned. Helgen has been purged in his light. Will Whiterun be next?
He is weak. And no doubt knows it. He's no fool, he'll come, if only to give his troops a chance to refit.
He was rewarded for his deeds by being joined with the Divines in eternal glory. The only mortal to do so.
He's a fool, if you haven't met him already. Thinks Ulfric Stormcloak is invincible and spits dragon fire.
He's stewing in the pit while we figure out what to do with him, if you've got the stomach to look at him.
Here, take my satchel and give it to my father, Verner. He'll likely have something for you to bring back.
Hey there! Can you believe this place? So cold my breath turns to icicles! What are we even doing up here?
Hmm... That's like telling you about the cold of space, or terror of midnight. Sithis is all those things.
I am one of the Afflicted. I'd have been dead from this plague a year ago if not for Peryite's protection.
I can handle training one more. After that, I think we'll be ready for a little dragon hunting of our own.
I can't explain the details. That would be giving away many secrets the Synod have learned over the years.
I can't see you, Reyda! I can't find you! Why are you hiding? Hiding, hide, hide, hide! Don't make me sad!
I damn near met my end in that war. An Aldmeri soldier ran me through with his blade and left me for dead.
I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, this place has gone mad.
I don't care what you think. The Empire put Maven on the throne for a reason. That's all you need to know.
I don't have time for this nonsense. I've got a home to keep and children to feed. Now let me out of here!
I don't know, Babette. Looks like she may have suffered a head wound. Best not let her out of our sight...
I don't much like this, I'll tell you. But you've saved my skin, so maybe I can overlook the past for now.
I guess they think I can open Ulfric's eyes to their plight, and get him to lift a finger on their behalf.
I have. One of the old Akaviri records names a dragon living nearby. Shall we send the Blades to help you?
I just can't seem to tear myself away. Whatever this is, its beauty is like nothing I've ever seen before.
I just wish things were simpler. In my days as a soldier, I knew who the enemy was, and how to defeat him.
I know her techniques, her skills. If she kills me, there'll be no one left that could possibly catch her.
I know life on the docks isn't easy. Sometimes life puts you in difficult circumstances you didn't choose.
I owe you a debt, and I aim to repay it. We'll see each other again someday. For now, goodbye, and thanks.
I think by now, most within the Guild are well aware of what transpired between Mercer Frey and ourselves.
I thought it was crystal clear... no one dies on these jobs. Remember that next time you want to get paid.
I will make sure this gets back to the Jarl. Minus my cut, of course. Consider your name cleared, for now.
I would find the Dwemers' mechanical guardians fascinating if they didn't try to kill everything on sight.
I'll be glad when that beast is gone from Dragonsreach. I never understood what the point of all this was.
I'll be sure to stress your urgency. It seems like every farmer in Skyrim is short on supplies these days.
I'll have you know I can haul up just as much iron as you in a day and still manage to clean up my messes.
I'm afraid there's a further problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.
I'm just glad we had this, now. I was almost getting ready to eat my servant and blame it on the Forsworn.
I'm not seeing signs of any warding magics at all. Either they're not here, or they were removed long ago.
I'm sorry, Aduri, not this year. Perhaps next year after the harvest, I don't know. There's so much to do.
I'm taking you out of the game for now. No jobs will be offered and you won't be able to fence your goods.
I've converted the classic tale of Eyldi the Bear to be performed with drums. I think you'll be impressed!
I've heard of him. My father had suspicions about his connection to the Mythic Dawn. Guess they were true.
I've heard some things about Ulfric I don't like, but he's right about this war and about Skyrim's future.
If I hadn't sunk every bit of gold I had into my mill, I would have picked up and left Ivarstead long ago.
If I see you sneaking off with even one speck of silver, I'll break your leg and throw you into the river.
If it'll put your mind at ease, then I agree. But not now, all right? We need the business from the stand.
If these Nords don't let up soon, I might just make a break for it. At least Cyrodiil is warmer than this.
If you're asking, that means you're the new lifer. Tough luck, friend. Those guards sold you out but good.
If you're ever in need of some quick coin for items you find on the job, Tonilia is the best fence around.
In exchange for Markarth, the source of most of Skyrim's silver? Hardly. I might rather consider Whiterun.
In only a few short years, he's taken that bile he calls mead to market and a chunk of my profits with it!
In return, you'll be required to defend the Twilight Sepulcher and everything within when the need arises.
It doesn't matter if they're in the city. We fight them where they live, we won't have to fight them here.
It took all the favors, bribes, and blackmails I could muster, but I've secured your exit out of the keep.
It was my pleasure, friend. In a way, I envy you getting to carry such a direct sign of Kynareth's graces.
It's about time they turned their gaze from the heavens, back to our bleeding homeland. What do they want?
It's all right. I will not shun you for what you are. Stay. I will tell you everything you have forgotten.
It's inside Reachcliff Cave. But the dead have stirred from their slumber recently, and I was forced here.
It's intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lightning, is it not?
Just how long did you expect me to keep those people distracted? I had to let the whole plan fall through.
Keep watch in the Stone Quarter tomorrow night. That's almost certainly where the killer will strike next.
Looks like he's gone for good this time. But I don't think we should stick around to see if he comes back.
Loyal? Thongvor supports Ulfric and his Stormcloaks! We should imprison the entire family as a precaution.
Mallus is teaching me everything he knows about brewing. Hopefully, I can take over his position some day.
Mark these words carefully, fetcher. Stay away from my family, or I will paint the ground with your blood.
Maybe I'll make the Potage le Magnifique, hmm? But not the way you make it! Ha ha ha. No, certainly not...
Maybe so, but I can't be making concessions before negotiations even start. It makes the Empire look weak.
Mercer must be brought before the Guild to answer for what he's done. He needs to pay for Gallus's murder.
Mercer thinks he knows a way to identify this new thorn in our side. He wants to meet with you right away.
My Lady, I've come before you to throw myself upon your mercy and to accept responsibility for my failure.
Nasty business with that Ancano fellow. Pity that I was unable to assist, but I was... otherwise occupied.
Next, you'll infiltrate their position and get their attention while we hit them with a barrage of arrows.
No, wait! I was just... catching my breath... why wouldn't I tell you again? I don't even know anything...
No. No! Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but you take your orders from me. Are we clear on that?
Now his spirit becomes one with the Evergloam... the realm of perpetual twilight and the cradle of shadow.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm not quite in the mood to entertain guests. I trust you can show yourself out.
Now then. Here's my invitation, I don't have a poisoned dagger strapped to my thigh, et cetera, et cetera.
Now, the horse I got for sale is seven years old, but in fine health. She's got a lot of spirit, that one.
Oh ho. The whimpering Nord, eh? Yes, yes, I can see how you'd come to that conclusion. Interesting choice.
Oh, I do wish to get to know you better. But I must tend to mother. Maybe we can talk for just a moment...
Oh, I do wish we could get to know each other better. But not now! I must tend to mother. See her settled.
Oh. Oh-no. This won't do at all. The copy is incomplete, it's aged to the point that parts are unreadable.
Oh... Oh how marvelous. Just delicious. It is everything I had hoped it would be. Please, everyone. Enjoy.
Once the war is over, I'll petition Ulfric to send the militia and we'll cleanse the Reach of this menace.
Orchendor? Kesh knew him. He's an Overseer. Shepherd. Gathers the Afflicted, contains the festering wound.
Our Family, my dearest. Our Family. Together, united as one, the Dark Brotherhood can accomplish anything.
People say I'm making gold off of other people's misery, but what else would I do? Smithing is all I know.
Perhaps you have encountered Ma'dran or Akhari? Both are sworn to me, and both have worthy goods to offer.
Personally? No, not I. One of their number used to advise the Arch-Mage when I was but an Apprentice here.
Place your hands on my altar one last time, and you will witness the power of Mehrunes Dagon for yourself.
Please, make haste. The Emperor's ship won't stayed moored forever. We won't get a chance like this again.
Really? That must be so nice. I came all the way to Skyrim just to get away from my family's expectations.
Remember, though, being a Blade is a lifelong commitment. Their loyalty has to be with us once they're in.
Retribution was swift. I was captured, quickly tried, and sentenced to death. But my execution never came.
Ripe fruit and fresh vegetables for sale! Straight from the fields and orchards of Whiterun to your table!
S'rendarr be merciful! What ill fortune that this should happen now, while we are trying to make a living.
Seems like no one is getting a decent night's rest in Dawnstar, stranger. Best buy your steel and move on.
She did what had to be done. It was long overdue. My only regret is that I wasn't able to kill him myself.
She used to sing the most lovely songs to me when we were courting. I've never heard a voice so beautiful.
Son, when the Emperor's safety is concerned, anything could go wrong. Off with you, now. And good travels.
Summoned in spirit form is not raised from the dead. She'll need help before she can return to the living.
Sure you finished, but you killed someone to do it. Next time listen to the rules if you want to get paid.
Take it, and get out of here. Bring back that staff before Ancano brings the whole College down around us.
Take your seat at the council table and let us see what wisdom we can find among these warriors of Skyrim.
Technically, that is true. But I still report to the Aldmeri Dominion, and I cannot ignore this situation.
Thank you so much for taking care of those thieves. The Riverwood Trader is back to the way it used to be!
Thanks. You and Sam drink too hard for me. Think I'll take my gold and go buy something for this headache.
That I do. I had a messenger from Dragon Bridge stop here on his way to the Blue Palace, not too long ago.
That isn't an option. Maven sees me serve a competitor's brand here and we may as well dig our own graves.
That sapling you recovered means the Gildergreen will live again. Your deed honors the people of Whiterun.
That'll be the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater. He's an honorable enough man. Never done wrong by me or my kin.
That's where you come in. I've got plenty of work available that could guide us down the road to recovery.
The cold, frightening truth is that the Empire represents progress. Anyone who fears progress is a coward.
The College is a place where we can focus on that, without the pressures of the world weighing down on us.
The contracts I dole out are fairly simple - go to a location, and kill the target. But this is different.
The Empire. They absconded with them. Or so they think. The ones they saw. The ones they thought they saw.
The fair Jonna does me a great courtesy by allowing me to entertain the guests of her noble establishment.
The finished material has the delicate nature of fresh powder snow, but the strength of the hardest steel.
The Jarl is refusing to dispatch men to the front lines. Do you think it's because of the Forsworn threat?
The war's been hard on the farm and hard on Dravin. We don't know what to expect from one day to the next.
Then came the flash of light - just on the horizon, within the clouds that mark the border between worlds.
Then out of the clear blue, Aringoth stops sending us our cut. Mercer was... well, angry to put it kindly.
There are those in the Empire who would wish to evade their obligations to help root out the Talos heresy.
There is indeed much that we know that you do not. That does not mean that you are ready to understand it.
There was a great battle here in Whiterun. It was quite thrilling! I must compose a song about it someday.
They say he Shouted it into submission in single combat atop Mount Anthor and brought it back to Whiterun.
They're the Masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting. They live up on top of the Throat of the World.
This doesn't tell me much. The only thing that could identify Sabjorn's partner is this odd little symbol.
This machinery, all of it, was designed to collect starlight, and then... I'm not sure. Split it, somehow?
This one should be easy. Get in, plant the goods and get out. Quiet and neat. Sound like your kind of job?
This, as you can see, is our Sanctuary. You won't find a safer place in all of Skyrim. So get comfortable.
Uncle Ralof! Can I see your axe? How many Imperials have you killed? Do you really know Ulfric Stormcloak?
Unmid and Anuriel shouldn't blame themselves for Riften's fall, I am the one who's ultimately responsible.
Until he's dead... well, I'm sorry, but we would dishonor our oaths as Blades if we continued to help you.
Watch that tongue, Rendar, or your whole lot could be down with the Argonians hauling ballast by tomorrow.
We don't need your charity, Breton. If my girls deserve something nice, it'll be their father who buys it.
We had an arrangement with Maven. We kept an eye on Goldenglow Estate to make sure the honey kept flowing.
We have lived in Skyrim since before the Nords came. Our way is simple, all work to make the tribe strong.
We left to help with the war and these filth bags swooped in and seized the place.  My family is in there.
We're behind again. I need you to catch another two bushels by week's end if I'm to make another delivery.
Welcome, welcome, welcome! Don't see many strangers out here. Come to get your hands dirty on a real farm?
Well, I'm not one to welch on a deal, so here's your reward. I hope you put it to good use. I know I have.
Well, you can Shout now. You couldn't before, right? That can only mean one thing. You must be Dragonborn.
What do you say now, Proventus? Shall we continue to trust in the strength of our walls? Against a dragon?
What have you done? They'll think I did it. Wait, I did do it! I'm not paying you! This is all your fault!
What's the matter, friend? Khajiit got your tongue? Maybe you need a little ditty to loosen your gob, hmm?
What's to say? I was born on a farm, joined the Legion when I came of age, and I've served you ever since.
Whatever you did at Honningbrew, you're now on her good side. Best of all, if she's happy, Mercer's happy.
When the Skeleton Key was stolen from the Twilight Sepulcher, our access to the inner sanctum was removed.
While a good fight is always entertaining, my patrons don't like blood in their food. Put the weapon away.
With the dragons returning, and now a Dragonborn appearing... maybe the Greybeards know what it all means.
Wonder what kinds of things they've got the Dibella doing, over in the temple. Mostly praying, I reckon...
Yes, but that's too close to Mixwater Mill. We don't want to get Gilfre angry at us by stealing her trees.
Yes, I suppose someone has to be around here. Have you seen the condition of this sorry excuse for a city?
Yes. Ever since mother died a few winters ago. I play songs and help with the drinks when I have the time.
Yes. The man came by at noon just like you said. I gave him the package and he gave me this pouch for you.
You drew blood, so you aren't getting paid. That's the rules. You don't like it, take it up with Brynjolf.
You found it! The passage goes through the sarcophagus... I don't like this... but we'd better keep going.
You know, in the Priesthood of Arkay, we have a joke about an empty pocket being better than a full grave.
You know, the Winking Skeever's not just the best inn in Solitude. It's the also the only inn in Solitude.
You know, this is one of a very few places where you can receive a real education in the schools of magic.
You sure you won't change your mind? Riverwood isn't far. I'm sure my sister will be glad to help you out.
You thought what? You would skip a step? Not heat the metal all the way through? Useless! Now do it again.
You will? Thank you! Ten pinches of fire salts should give me all I need to bring this forge back to life.
You've been here for a while, right? What was it like back when we could still make runs out to the coast?
Your target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
Your typical Solitude wench is like the city itself. Stormy exterior, but ah the charms that lie within...
Zok brit uth! I warn you, once you've flown the skies of Keizaal, your envy of the dov will only increase.
*coughs* The cat... *gasp* Ra'jiir... ambushed me. He's trying to take the sword back! I... can't... *gasp*
A wise choice, my friend. After all, what would a common adventurer know about the complexities of finance?
Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like you. Hmph. No, definitely not like you.
Ah, yes. You. I remember you. You're going to help? That's fine. Just... Just don't make a mess of my work.
All I care about is cause and effect. Did the job get done and was it done correctly. There's no gray area.
All of us possess untapped abilities; the potential to wield great power, securely sealed within our minds.
Although it would benefit the Guild more than you can imagine, in the end, it would do more harm than good.
Although... that court wizard does all manner of experiments. And I know he owns some truly strange things.
Amazing... you can see how the Akaviri craftsmen were beginning to embrace the more flowing Nordic style...
And he's transporting some giant box. Says it's a coffin, and he's going to bury his mother. Mother my eye.
And none of the waiters will bring me a drink. Elenwen must have told them to cut me off, the frigid bitch.
And now the dragons are attacking everywhere, indiscriminately. Skyrim is weakened, the Empire is weakened.
And when the guard traces it back here, and Maven is implicated, I'll be sure to tell her it was your idea.
As for where to find it... such blasphemies have always been the stock in trade of the mages of Winterhold.
At present, there is no confirmation of any of the various theories surrounding the nature of these stones.
Before we continue, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. If you play by the rules, you walk away rich.
Books. Don't know why the Imperials like these so much. This should help the boy, though, Malacath willing.
Brina Merilis came in with the whole damn Legion and deposed Skald. Couldn't have happened to a better man.
Burn all the hives and she'd have to import honey for Black-Briar Meadery which would cut into her profits.
But I've had some disturbing reports of you... seen talking to General Tullius in Castle Dour, for example.
But never mind that, even though you fouled up the job I still think you've got that spark I'm looking for.
But only if you're partial to being flayed alive and having an angry immortal skip rope with your entrails.
But this sneaking around. It doesn't befit warriors of your standing. Aela knows better, and so should you.
But... I can't help but notice that you're doing quite well for yourself, rising through the ranks and all.
By my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. It's the greatest honor that's within my power to grant.
Can't say I'll ever get used to the damn cold, or understand these Nords... but, I've come to respect them.
Check every crate, chest and barrel you see. Who knows, maybe a few of them have something valuable inside.
Come to Dragonsreach to discuss the ongoing hostilities, like the rest of the [QUOTE]great warriors[QUOTE]?
Congratulations. You slaughtered an emaciated beggar in cold blood. You are truly an opponent to be feared.
Could you do an old elf a favor? I misplaced my journal in a cave I was exploring. I'll pay for its return.
Damned Imperial lies! My men would never stoop to such methods, even in retaliation for your butchery at...
Did you hear? The Hall of the Dead is closed. Brother Verulus isn't the most popular man in town right now.
Did you see the fires from Goldenglow Estate? I was afraid the whole place was going to burn to the ground!
Even the Falmer don't deserve the pain these implements must have inflicted. The dwarves were a cruel race.
Fair enough. We're driving the Stormcloaks back well enough at the moment, but we're already overstretched.
First off, seems the Jarl's Steward might be vulnerable to blackmail. Need to investigate that possibility.
Firstly, I've never even seen Morrowind. Secondly, in volcanic soil the plants practically grow themselves.
For some reason that door is special. Only two people can open it, Balgruuf and Farengar, the court wizard.
Great. Looks like you'll be one of us soon.  We'll gather outside the College for the Burning of King Olaf.
Ha! I do love it when the mortals know they're being manipulated. Makes things infinitely more interesting.
Have you visited Rorikstead lately? No matter how harsh the winter, the crops that grow there never falter.
He owes this tavern enough coin to burn it down, build it back up, then burn it down again just for laughs.
Here is the spell you need. Go to the top of the Hall of Attainment; I have prepared a place for you there.
Here it comes again. Not happy with a roof and a trade, no. You want to be something entirely... different.
Here the ancient Tongues, the first mortal masters of the Voice, brought Alduin to battle and defeated him.
Hmm. The Rift would help secure our communications with Cyrodiil... and threaten Ulfric's southern flank...
I am but a humble instrument of Sithis. Our Dread Father guides me. Therefore, failure is an impossibility.
I can be trusted. I know this. But they do not. Onikaan ni ov dovah. It is always wise to mistrust a dovah.
I can breathe more deeply now. I can't smell your heart beating the way I used to. But my mind is... clear.
I cannot leave Idgrod's side, so I must stay here. Could you see that it reaches Captain Aldis in Solitude?
I didn't simply mean it could kill you. The Augur's accident is another very real type of a life destroyed.
I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, Grelod has been so angry.
I do. A personal matter. My father died trying to negotiate with the Forsworn, back when that was possible.
I don't like fighting these Dwemer creations. Where's the fun in killing something that doesn't even bleed?
I heard Valdr made it back safe. Too bad about the others, but at least it's one less thing to worry about.
I heard you were at the wedding of the Emperor's cousin. In Solitude? Gods, that must have been horrible...
I once killed six men, single-handed, while rescuing my brothers-in-arms from ambush by an Imperial patrol.
I suppose the Greybeards care about Skyrim's troubles, in their way, but I needed to do something about it.
I think I've located another one of the Totems. Come with me, and we'll write ourselves into their history.
I think you've been taking things that don't belong to you. Pay your debts, and we'll forget this happened.
I tolerate your son because he'll do anything I ask, without question. I'd expect the same from my own son.
I want to beg his forgiveness. Give him back the ring. But while I'm stuck in here, the beast wanders free.
I want you to head out to Markarth and speak to Endon. He's a silversmith... has some kind of a shop there.
I will grant you my understanding of Clear Skies. This is your final gift from us, Dragonborn. Use it well.
I... I am unsure. He is somewhere within the College. Surely one of your colleagues must know his location.
I'm afraid you've been a little mis-informed. I have something of mine, that I was going to sell to Arniel.
I'm glad you're with us. I don't like the looks of this place... and I'm not talking about the Stormcloaks.
I've already put in a claim to the land and property you'll forfeit when you're found to be a collaborator.
I've also heard troubling rumors about dealings between you and the crew of that pirate ship, the Red Wave.
I've dreamed of seeing Eldergleam for years. Might I travel alongside you? I promise not to get in the way.
I've seen enough death to last three lifetimes, yet I never tire of a good fight. What do you make of that?
If I had my way, I'd spend all my time at parties like this, and none of it dealing with the common rabble.
If it looks to you like an impoverished slum, that's because it is. Ulfric prefers that we live in squalor.
If nothing else, I'd take it as a compliment. The Psijics have only ever dealt with those they feel worthy.
If there's one thing I'm certain of, it's that draugr burn like tinder. We could use that to our advantage.
If this truce will help the Dragonborn here put an end to that menace, we both gain. Remember that, Ulfric.
If you can get to the bottom of this, the Priesthood of Arkay will reward you. Take my key, and be careful.
Indeed. My reverence for Vaermina's machinations should not take precedence over our mission. My apologies.
Is this what killed that Stormcloak over there? Can't be. It looks like it's been dead for a hundred years.
It says Mercer's been stealing from our vault for years. Gallus was looking into it before he was murdered.
It started out innocent enough; he kept claiming the shipments were light because of Imperial interference.
It would mean cutting the Star off from Azura. Only black souls would be able to enter it once we finished.
Just because we live in the middle of nowhere doesn't give Ranmir the right to drink himself into oblivion.
Long as you clean up. You know how to use it right? Mix a couple of ingredients together, see what happens.
Ma didn't live long enough to see me join, but I fight to honor her and all my Shield-Sisters through time.
Master Borri will teach you [QUOTE]Kest[QUOTE] - [QUOTE]Tempest[QUOTE]- the third word of Whirlwind Sprint.
Mauhulakh brought us in when he found ebony in the mine. Not enough men in town to work it, so here we are.
Maven prefers that Aringoth remains alive, but if he tries to stop you from getting the job done, kill him.
No, it can't be... oh my... and all this time, I was thinking he'd been unfaithful to me. I feel so stupid.
No, not until the Moot meets to choose another. And it won't meet until one side or the other wins the war.
No, so your best plan is to follow him after he leaves Dragon Bridge. However, there is one other option...
Nords don't care much for magic. The College in Winterhold is about the only place it's not looked down on.
Nothing tastes better than food you've grown yourself. Something magic about dirt and sunshine making food.
Now all I need to do is find someone to get it. Wait. You. You could do it. I need you to get me that drum.
Now aren't you a strange one. Well, if you're here to shop, shop. If not, find some other caravan to stalk.
Now that this is a Black-Briar Meadery, you can be sure that we'll be selling only the best mead in Skyrim.
Oh, thank you, but I should be fine now that you've shown me the way. But those bandits have to be stopped!
Olfrid Battle-Born made his money from farming, an' got himself some new friends among the Empire's nobles.
On the other hand, takin' some of these extra jobs off my hands, now that'll get you to the top of my list.
Our Grand Master saw them as the greatest threat to Tamriel. At the time, that was true. Maybe it still is.
Poor mother... she's been waiting here so long... Stupid farmer and his stupid tools! Why won't he help us?
Remember to stay within the boundaries and only use the practice arrows. I have some if you don't have any.
Rumor has it you couldn't follow the Guild's rules, so we can't do any business until it's been worked out.
See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. When I was a boy, that place always used to give me nightmares.
See, there you go. Getting involved. Don't ask too many questions in Markarth. Safer for everyone that way.
Smithing's been in my blood for generations. I owe my success to my forefathers and their recipe for flame.
So what are you doing here? Lorkhan's eyes, you can't let the Thalmor get to him first! Get back to Riften!
Some believed the mages were behind the whole thing, and others felt they could have at least prevented it.
Sybille Stentor has a grasp of magical theory that I would never have expected from a human. Even a Breton.
Tell him I sent you. Ask him why he's here. I want you to know how widespread the injustice of Markarth is.
Thank you. This should turn that old cat's gaze. Maybe I'll be able to become a caravaneer myself, one day.
That clumsy maid at the palace spilled wine on my best suit. Sister, I believe it's time for a replacement.
That definitely matches the description of the totem from Skjor's old book. Let's get it to the Underforge.
That said... If your attack on Virane is witnessed, those Markarth guards are going to be none too happy...
That's what an old man gets for thinking the younger generation might be interested in learning some honor.
The Dark Brotherh... Oh. Oh! I... my goodness, you're really here! The Black Sacrament. It actually worked?
The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Reach, allowing Ulfric's forces unhindered access to Markarth.
The festival would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our most recent inductee.
The Greybeards have arranged a truce between the Stormcloaks and Imperials. How long can such a thing last?
The last jailbreak I attempted failed. I was imprisoned in High Rock for three years before they let me go.
The last time we'd discussed this issue was before this damnable war broke out. Things were different then.
The only name I have is Niranye. Has a house right here in Windhelm. That's where you should begin looking.
The original Companions. Their finest warriors rest with Ysgramor. You'll have to prove yourselves to them.
The rebels are only inflaming the tension and weakening the Empire by distracting it from its ultimate aim.
The say the College has been snooping around Saarthal. Mages in a burial crypt. No good can come of that...
The Stormcloaks are here. In force. Get down to the front line. This is it. We must hold the city. Move it!
The various points of focus for magic energies around the College have become polluted, and need cleansing.
The walls of Markarth may be high, but their age will have created weakness or secret entrances. Find them!
Their relative positions do not indicate that any individual stone is part of a larger, unobserved pattern.
There's trouble up in Winterhold. I'm a little surprised anyone's complaining about it, but money is money.
These energies, on occasion, become... polluted. Effort must be made to see that they are kept pure, clean.
They won't say much, but most people have very strong opinions about the College and those that study here.
Those two boys were obsessed with mead. Convinced they could concoct something to compete with Honningbrew.
Today, Whiterun is the jewel of Skyrim. I can say without boast that is the greatest city in all the holds.
Treat her right and she'll make you rich. Try and rip her off and you'll have the whole Guild to answer to.
Unfortunately, sometimes the stone of scholarship is built on the foundation of death. I'll inform the kin.
Vipir [QUOTE]the Fleet.[QUOTE] The only man who's foolish enough to name himself after his bedroom prowess.
Watch yourself out there. The mercenaries Aringoth hired are trained killers. Just ask our poor little Vex.
We would but there's a big wedding taking place at Castle Dour. We'll have to wait until after the wedding.
We're expected to fight there tomorrow. Gjukar elected to camp here for the night. I don't like it, though.
We're going to install a garrison there, but first, your going to clean out the bandits that have moved in.
We're taking Winterhold. Get over there and join the rest of the men gathering for the attack. Now soldier!
We're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives. And when Sovngarde beckons, every one of us dies!
Well it's about damn time. Capturing a woman from her home, keeping her bound like an animal. Ridiculous...
Well now, how is Astrid doin' these days, uh? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up.
Well, let's just say that I know some people who are experts at helping others disappear when they need to.
Well, that explains why the guards let you in. Come on then, the Jarl will want to speak to you personally.
Well, the Stormcloak guards drink a lot more than the Imperials did, so I've been making more money lately.
Well. I'm afraid I can't help you with that. I need the crystal to do anything useful, and I don't have it.
Well... I suppose in that case, it's okay to let you in. But only briefly. Be careful, and come right back!
What is there to know? It's in the temple, you bring it out. You bring it to me, I pay you. Now get moving.
What is this... it's... it's just a book?! I can see. The world beyond burns in my mind. It's marvelous....
What was it like? Cidhna Mine? We've all been talking about your escape. And being pardoned after. Amazing.
What's going on, Madanach? You wouldn't have old Grisvar killed unless you weren't planning on needing him.
What's this? If that oaf thinks all I'm going to do is stay in that filthy house of his and clean, I'll....
When I finally became a priest, they gave me the new high priest's dagger, but I already owned my father's.
When I retired here in Windhelm, most folk already knew me as Captain Lonely-Gale, and the name just stuck.
When I saw the little girl, I was just... I could feel it coming on. I could taste the... I needed to hunt.
Who would dare attack the leader of the Companions? In his own hall? There'll be blood for this, I know it.
Whoa. Hey there. I didn't mean to make you upset. On my honor, Carlotta won't have to worry about me again.
Why do we always focus on retelling the old stories? There are so many new stories being made, right now...
Why don't you keep that dagger and helmet? Maybe you'll remember me when you're making Skyforge Steel, huh?
Why don't you take it? We can always make another for the day when this war ends and Thorald can come home.
Yamarz has revealed himself as a coward and a schemer, and has earned the fate of all who follow that path.
Yes, you've made that quite clear in the past. And now we have Urog and Dushnamub because of your weakness.
Yesterday, I saw a dragon fly right over the city. Headed northeast. Toward Shearpoint, by the looks of it.
You are now in the Arcanaeum, of which I am in charge. It might as well be my own little plane of Oblivion.
You break the rules and you lose your share. No debates, no discussions... you do what we say, when we say.
You deal with them, I'll make sure you get paid. Maybe this old soldier will throw in some lessons as well.
You didn't seem to need either to sell Gleda to the Giant in the first place. I think you'll figure it out.
You have to understand, his presence here has caused... Well, it's difficult for the people to get used to.
You know what I mean. Tell your boss that rough is rough, but when someone pulls a dagger fun time is over.
You may have a point. It's getting difficult to even move troops around without attracting a dragon attack.
You must be new around here. Bad manners to ask such a direct question, at one of Elenwen's little soirees.
You! You must have told Maven about the horse. If you'd just stuck to the plan, I wouldn't be in this mess.
You're free to use those powers as you see fit to further your own goals or the goals of the Thieves Guild.
You've got to admire their courage, doing something like that with dragons on the loose and a war going on.
...lyin' little harlot... that brat ain't mine... could be anyone's... won't get one rusty septim from me...
[QUOTE]Fair[QUOTE] is a word rarely applied to politics, my grace. I'm afraid you must learn to accept this.
[QUOTE]So ends the story of Olaf the liar, a thief and a scoundrel we of Solitude commit to the fire.[QUOTE]
A few years before Mercer murdered Gallus, the Guild took in a thief who specialized in dwarven antiquities.
A rare few are born with a gift for making money. My investments are my strength and my wealth is my weapon.
After years and years of work, I'm closing in on a way to investigate what happened through experimentation.
Ah, now that's a good idea. Head on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach is smarter than you think.
Ah, wonderful, wonderful! Why waste all that hatred on yourself when it can so easily be directed at others!
Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! Seems you are a cut above the usual brutes the Jarl sends my way.
Also, I think you should take this amulet. It belonged to Savos, but I think would do you the most good now.
And he is no fool. Ni mey, rinik gut nol. Far from it. He began as the wisest and most far-seeing of us all.
And now they know Mercer never genuinely cared about the Guild. He lacked the loyalty you obviously possess.
As part of your initiation, Master Einarth will allow you to tap into his understanding of [QUOTE]Ro.[QUOTE]
As the saying goes, you do not need to be faster than the dragon; you need only be faster than your friends.
At this rate, we won't last more than a few more seasons at best. Then I'll just have to sell the old place.
Atmah cried to herself. Hafnar wouldn't look at either of us. And I kept telling them it would be all right.
Aye. A gift from the Black-Briars after they kicked the previous family out... place called Riftweald Manor.
Been a murder, over in Riften. Some old lady who runs an orphanage. Those poor children must be heartbroken.
Begone, before even my philosophy is tested beyond the breaking point. We are men of peace, and you are not.
But do you have the discipline and temperament to follow the path laid out for you? That remains to be seen.
But I swear upon Lady Mara that I will do everything within my power to prevent any harm from befalling you.
But if you spare me, I can be a powerful ally to you. And I would promise to never return to civilized life.
But imagine -- fleets of ships sailing from Windhelm, all bearing the Stormcloak flag! It would be glorious!
But the Jarl has been hesitant to call for his arrest. I want you to break in to his home and find evidence.
But you're right. Victory is within our grasp. We can afford to give the Empire one more chance to withdraw.
By the way, you might want to stop in at Warmaiden's. These days, folk need all the protection they can get.
Can you imagine how wonderful it would be to set what you see on a canvas so you'd have that memory forever?
Capturing that dragon was a mighty deed. In my younger days, I'd have been the first to join in the attempt.
Come now, my friend. Haven't we played this game long enough? Untie me, and we can all go our separate ways.
Convince her that we'll be coming for her, and she needs to leave. Lead her to the stables outside Whiterun.
Could you call yourselves Nords if you ran from this monster? Are you going to let me face this thing alone?
Curses notwithstanding, the tombs of kings are always full of traps to ward off grave robbers, are they not?
Damn it, Proventus. I've got war lurking just outside my gates, and this is what you offer me? This? Begone.
Dead dragons... it hasn't moved since Ysgramor and it's not going to start now. Superstitious milk drinkers.
Do we have anyone reliable to send out there? I don't want to look the fool again in front of her, Brynjolf.
Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here he is. Now what is it that you want?
Even when every other farm in the hold is barely scraping by, the harvest at Rorikstead is always bountiful.
Everyone said it had run out, but I smashed down one wall and found the widest veins of ebony I'd ever seen.
Exactly. One of the pieces stolen from her was a silver locket, a Cruel-Sea family heirloom. I want it back.
Fortunately, his identity isn't known to the authorities in Whiterun, so there's still a chance to save him.
Fralia, do you ever deal with the Khajiit at all? I'm sure they would love to trade in your husband's steel.
General Tullius is counting on us to bring back the Jagged Crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do.
Gerdur? Owns the lumber mill, if I'm not mistaken. Pillar of the community. Not prone to flights of fancy...
Good work, son. We'll take it from here. Head down to the barracks for some food and rest. You've earned it.
Good! There's some gold in it for you if you succeed. Here's the meat - check the road just outside of town.
Good. If you see him, tell him Grosta said he can go straight to Oblivion... he's not welcome here any more.
Gretta, Engar, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Imperial reinforcements taking us by surprise.
Guess Tullius wants to make sure everything's locked down before launching a serious campaign for Eastmarch.
Ha ha! The news is everywhere! Vittoria Vici, the Emperor's cousin, butchered at her own wedding! Well done!
Half of the businesses in town owe me money, and I own most of the rest. I practically run Solitude already.
Have you been bringing the battle to the Silver Hand, friend? I wish I could be there with you. Soon enough.
He even has some wolves guarding it. I swear, I should just cut out his tongue. That would be the end of it.
He has no idea the extent of Maven's fury when she's been cut out of a deal, but I'm certain he'll find out.
He's been gushing about how talented Ingun is at alchemy. He'd never say it to her face; that's not his way.
He's nothing more than a barbarian renegade, whose lust for power has cost the lives of countless innocents.
He's on one of his drunk rants again. Except this time he's challenging everyone to a duel over in the hole.
Heard me a rumor, boy. Something about you putting bugs in the stew over at the Sleeping Giant. You do this?
Here we commune with the voice of the sky, and strive to achieve balance between our inner and outer selves.
His noble spirit... the wisdom of ages... his deep understanding of our existence... all gone, and for what?
Hmph. If you see my good-for-nothing husband Leifnarr on your journeys tell him he's no longer welcome here.
I assign you Lydia as a personal Housecarl, and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
I believe there is a laboratory in the east wing. If we proceed there, we should be able to locate a sample.
I can't take this place anymore. The trees... all the colors, but the city, so dark. Why? It makes no sense.
I had my years of war and fighting. Senseless, all of it. All I want now is a rake and a patch of good soil.
I haven't changed my mind, if that's what you're asking. I won't leave Whiterun defenseless, even for a day.
I hear Adonato Leotelli's staying up in Windhelm. I've read a few of his works. Be good to meet him someday.
I hope so. But you'll forgive me if I don't assume that something's true just because the Greybeards say so.
I hope the elf didn't give you too much trouble. I once got set on fire by a sorcerer. Nasty business, that.
I just don't know what to do anymore. He's hardly ever in the temple. I see him at breakfast, and that's it.
I keep hoping this is another vision, that it's not real. But it is, isn't it? We really have lost our home.
I know what you're thinking: [QUOTE]This Belethor, how could he part with such magnificent treasures?[QUOTE]
I simply need more pieces of Dwemer equipment to study. It's nothing dangerous... At least, not necessarily.
I swear, if I wasn't around, Elgrim would forget to eat his meals. How we make any coin at all is beyond me.
I think I would prefer my ring back. I put a lot of time into making it and you just gave is away as a joke.
I think perhaps we're ready to begin exploring some of the various applications of magic throughout history.
I understand. We must all follow our own paths. If you wish to find me again, I'll be in Nightcaller Temple.
I warned you not to cross Maven. If I hadn't stepped in and paid amends, you'd be... well, I think you know.
I'd give a week's pay to see the look on Ulfric's face again, when he had to swallow the terms of the truce.
I'm afraid I can't offer you much right now, but please take this. And perhaps, if this is all successful...
I'm honored to be leading the latest generation of Namira's faithful. Those who have embraced what they are.
I'm not accustomed to dealing with people who are unreliable. That's why I asked Delvin to send me his best.
I'm so sorry my husband. You must remember, they're at the Bee and Barb to drink, not to listen to a sermon.
I'm sorry I mislead you. Return when this is over, and we'll talk about my involvement in the Thieves Guild.
I've been cracking rock ever since I was able to hold a pickaxe and I'm telling you, this mine is drying up.
I've heard the Empire plans to levy a tax on our trading ships. Falk, you've got to do something about this.
I've told you, my interest in the family business is quite low. I wish to be much more than just a merchant.
If you can find him and focus his attention, there's a great deal Drevis can teach you about Illusion magic.
If you still feel like doing some jobs, I'm sure Delvin and Vex have more than their fair share to give out.
If you want in, Calcelmo has to give his say-so. He's usually in front of Nchuand-Zel. Just down the tunnel.
If you want to try, go right ahead. I don't think anything will get through that thick skull of his, though.
If you're inquiring whether we have concerns about her age and inexperience, well, let me put it this way...
Imperial forces will withdraw from The Pale, and Jarl Skald the Elder will be allowed to return to Dawnstar.
In life we were enemies, but eternity's too long to hold a grudge - my heart's now free of such old hatreds.
In life, I was but a Speaker for the Black Hand. But you have been named Listener. There is no higher honor.
In your tongue, the Word simply means [QUOTE]Fire.[QUOTE] It is change given form. Power at its most primal.
It doesn't matter what I believe. Nurelion does, and it might be the only thing keeping him alive right now.
It wasn't until recently that I heard Mercer Frey and this Dark Elf named Karliah were a part of that group.
It will feel that way for a while. But eventually you'll get used to it, and then you'll get faster with it.
It's been my honor to perform at the Blue Palace on many occasions. His late lordship was quite the admirer.
It's going to take more than just myself and Aerin to help this city... it has to want to help itself first.
It's in a hollowed-out tree stump. In the marsh, south of Solitude. Now please, you'll let me go now. Right?
It's nothing, I just... It's Nazeem. How did we get to this point, Danica? Is there no love left between us?
Lady Nocturnal, we accept your terms. We dedicate ourselves to you as both your avengers and your sentinels.
Last night I saw Lod the blacksmith writing a letter. Probably sending word to Solitude and General Tullius.
Leave, stranger. Evil stirs in this place. I fear for the security of the very land if it should break free.
Look at that dark elf whore... strutting around like she's innocent. I'll cut her open from gullet to groin!
Look, if I was a little harsh before, I just wanted you to know it's because you were new. Know what I mean?
Look, this sounds like a family matter and I don't want the Guild in the middle of it. You do what you want.
Looking for my husband Nazeem? Check the Jarl's backside. That's usually where he stuffs himself these days.
M'aiq's father was also called M'aiq. As was M'aiq's father's father. At least, that's what his father said.
Malkoran is vanquished. Skyrim's dead shall remain at rest. This is as it should be. This is because of you.
Maybe so, but bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. Tullius needs to know I won't be pushed around.
Maybe we should start over, hmm? We want the Gourmet's famous Potage le Magnifique to be perfect, after all.
Maybe... hmm... what of the Greybeards? They are respected by all Nords. High Hrothgar is neutral territory.
Me? I'm Maul. I watch the streets for 'em. If you need dirt on anythin', I'm your guy... but it'll cost you.
Most days, I do all I can to stay away from my sister and my father. The beating's the same from either one.
Museums, keeps, estates... you name it. By the time Mercer took over the Guild we must have had a few dozen.
My chief, Gharol threatens to have me work in the mines. You won't allow my pretty hands to dirty, will you?
My errant formulas have cost Master Elgrim a fortune in ingredients; some of which are almost irreplaceable.
My family came here centuries ago. We've made a good living smithing the silver that flows through the city.
My father was a soldier. He fought in the great war and when it was over, he retired here to raise a family.
My heart goes out to them. If only our coffers were deeper, I could protect them as they were my own family.
My lady, I'm pleased to inform you that you have a new gown for court, specially tailored by madame Endarie.
My only demand is that these vermin are permanently eliminated before my reputation is completely destroyed.
No one's heard from the Psijic Order in so many years. Hard to believe one would just suddenly show up here.
No, no... not at all. Mara believes that the spark of a union comes from inside us, not from our appearance.
Nocturnal isn't one for worship and reverence. There are no priests and no sermons, no services and no alms.
Not much to go on -- I don't even know where he lives, or his name. But they seemed pretty excited about it.
Now let's move. I think that was the last of the Silver Hand, but still plenty of draugr for the both of us.
Of course, without functioning mills, who will make the arrows for our soldiers? Men have no sense of irony.
Oh, how reassuring! Most likely you're with the Thalmor and this is just a trick to get me to open the door!
Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend. Besides, who would ever want to harm such... Wait, it can't be.
Oh... I've heard of this. These walls are supposed to show the history of the ancients who built this place.
Old Nord folk tales always talk about Shouting their enemies to pieces. I always thought it was just a myth.
Once you have summoned the Dremora, you will order it to deliver to you a sigil stone from an Oblivion gate.
Perhaps someday I'll continue where he left off, it's the least I can do considering how much he did for me.
Rinik vazah. An apt phrase. Alduin bovul. One reason I came to your call was to test your Thu'um for myself.
Romlyn, I've been meaning to speak to you. I did a count at the meadery and we're four cases short... again.
See that disgusting drunk over there? A high-ranking official in the East Empire Company, believe it or not.
She never speaks with us. She's allowed this wizard, Falion, to live in our midst practicing gods-know-what.
She still mourns greatly for her husband, High King Torygg. So she leaves many of the courtly details to me.
She was the toughest of the bunch. Honestly, I'm amazed she didn't kick you out of the Bee and Barb herself.
She's a traveler, from the Imperial City. Came by every day looking for jewelry for her relatives back home.
So Cicero brought our Lady to her new home. Here! This is the only Sanctuary left in all of Skyrim, you see.
So you're the newest member of our dwindling, dysfunctional little Family. I've heard quite a bit about you.
Someone he could defeat that represented the Empire, the White-Gold Concordat, the banning of Talos worship.
Sometimes I miss the soldier's life, but when I hold my daughter in my arms, I know I made the right choice.
Stars? You wouldn't be referring to that incident a few years ago? I still say that exile was far too harsh.
Sure, sure. Got one that should be pretty easy, as long as you keep your weapon sheathed. Can you handle it?
Tell me again why we're wasting time and dwindling resources chasing a legend. We don't even know it exists!
Thankfully Faleen is not quite his type, but they've been friends for some time, and he may have some ideas.
That completely takes care of all your basic problems, magicka burn, dimensional collapse and thermic drift!
That one right there, walking out the door. He was one of them asking about that old man you're looking for.
That's tremendous! I have to admit I didn't fully believe it still existed. Now let's take a look at this...
That's what caused all the trouble. Soul gems are used in enchanting, but they break afterwards. Except one.
The circle of stones to the southwest? That's Secunda's Kiss. The giants hold it sacred, so tread carefully.
The cut they were giving me was good at first, but now it's time to clean things up. Go and take care of it.
The Falmer retreated underground and forged an uneasy alliance with the dwarves who ended up betraying them.
The first mortals that I taught the Thu'um - the first Tongues. The leaders of the rebellion against Alduin.
The girl's been running her mouth, wants an ex-lover killed. She's apparently performed the Black Sacrament.
The good people of Skyrim on occasion would rather pass judgment than attempt to understand what we do here.
The kind that curse you, haunt you in the dead of night. There is nothing you can do, nothing anyone can do.
The mead is same as it ever was and the meat is fresh, maybe your sense of taste has [QUOTE]gone off.[QUOTE]
The only thing Madanach expects is a bottle of Skooma in tribute every so often. You're not getting through.
The Poetic Edda is never truly complete. As a living history of Skyrim we Bards continually add parts to it.
The ring itself is worth a few bits. Keep it as thanks for cutting off the last vestige of an unwanted fate.
The young folks are too happy to break their backs for the Nords. They forget what it was like to swim free.
Their Voices are too powerful for anyone not trained in the Way to withstand. Even a whisper could kill you.
There are those who believe that the entire Dwemer race will one day return just as suddenly as it vanished.
There is no question. You are doom-driven. Kogaan Akatosh. The very bones of the earth are at your disposal.
There's an apothecary in town, yeah. But it's down on the lower walkway, so stay sharp if you go down there.
They have clashed with the Aldmeri Dominion before, and I have no intention of allowing that to happen here.
They say the Emperors used to be Dragonborn, but that all ended when Martin died during the Oblivion Crisis.
They're only a threat in the hills and along the roads, where they live. Everywhere else, we are in control.
This gathering is nothing more than a boast. The Thalmor are reminding us that we're at their beck and call.
This goes quite against College policy, and the party responsible is advised to cease these actions at once.
This is not play-acting, here. We are the true spirit of Skyrim. Honor is in our blood, death in our hearts.
This is the College of Winterhold, a safe haven for mages in Skyrim. A place of wisdom and arcane knowledge.
This is the land of my birth, the land that shaped me. I'm proud to have any part in making it strong again.
This was a mighty deed! The doom of Alduin encompassed at last, and cleansed is Sovngarde of his evil snare.
Too many bother my wife with their petty problems, and then don't even understand the advice she gives them.
Torbjorn Shatter-Shield. I wish someone would beat the coin out of his fat fists. He clings to every Septim.
Tsk. How unfortunate. I had hoped you would honor an old man's dying wish. Well, let's be done with it then.
Tythis, please. The Snow-Shods are good people, but tend to exaggerate. Try and stay calm for your own sake.
Ulfric Stormcloak is counting on us to bring him back that crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do.
Very well. If you change your mind, you can usually find me here. In the meantime, feel free to look around.
Very well. Perhaps when my research is complete, I'll feel more comfortable discussing my findings with you.
Violent one, huh? Best keep that to yourself, new blood. Others find out, they'll consider that a challenge.
Vulwulf has been quite generous to let me take care of their farm considering I am not part of their family.
We all are, my dear, but sometimes the Divines reward those who don't seem to deserve it. Call it dumb luck.
We found this in the Jarl's treasury after we captured the city. I thought you should be the one to have it.
We're here to arrange a temporary truce to allow the Dragonborn here to deal with the dragons. Nothing more.
We're looking for a fugitive who comes from Hammerfell. A Redguard woman. She may be somewhere in this city.
Well done. You sought me out, on your own initiative. You've done Whiterun a service, and I won't forget it.
Well guess who really runs things around here? Me. I own the mines. I make the coin pass to the right hands.
Well then, if you don't want the extra gold, you can certainly let Letrush keep it as a gesture of goodwill.
Well then, you're talking to the right person. I'm the only one left in Tamriel that can get my hands on it.
Well, let's all raise a flagon to Ulfric; future King of Skyrim and bringer of poverty to the working class!
Well, well. Look at you. The Nords have turned you into an animal. A wild beast caged up and left to go mad.
Well, your bounty is low... All right, get out of my sight. But you're known to me now, scum. Remember that.
What are you staring at, you worthless piece of gutter trash? I simply must start locking the doors again...
What I need? What I need is for Alain Dufont to die! I want him hunted down and murdered like the dog he is!
What? Nightingales? But, I always assumed they were just a tale... a way to keep the young footpads in line.
When Aventus took off, when he said those things, about killing Grelod... I never imagined he was serious...
Whenever a group of marauders attack a Nord village, Ulfric is the first to sound the horn and send the men.
Whoa, lad. I'd do just as well drawing a blade across my own neck. Where did this foolish request come from?
Why do you insist on defending that woman? All she does with her money is spend it on that Dark Elf garbage!
Yes, exactly! Most people don't know that it was originally built to hold a captive dragon - hence its name.
Yes, from what I've heard I expect Tolfdir will be occupied for some time. Hmm, that is a problem, isn't it?
Yes, the Steward is taking visitors. However, I must accompany you at all times while on the royal premises.
Yes, yes. Don't worry. Although the chance to see a living dragon up close would be tremendously valuable...
Yes. I've wandered a bit, but I always come back to Kynesgrove. My clan was one of the first to settle here.
You aren't for hire, are you? A sellsword? I'll pay you if you can recover that statuette from the Forsworn.
You don't really expect compensation every time a farm gets burned in a war that you started, do you Ulfric?
You were there with us. You saw it. The day the Empire signed that damn treaty was the day the Empire died. 
You... you're an Argonian! Where did you learn to cook like that? Surely not in Black Marsh. Why even the...
You'd be surprised how much work it is selling things at a stall. It's not all standing around and chatting.
You'll shut your mouth and get back to work, or you won't be a miner or a soldier by the day's end. Hear me?
You're going to clear a path to the giant, so I can conserve my strength. I'll make sure you're paid for it.
You're probably right. I was hoping to avoid having to involve them in this, but it seems we have no choice.
You've done more than enough already. You've been a good friend in a time of need, and we won't forget that.
Your people's war, I mean. The Nords. What kind of life would we be giving our little one if we stayed here?
...What? Mother? Is that your voice I hear? Hmm... No, no... Just my head playing tricks... Foolish Cicero...
A flame atronach's body might provide fire salt. They're dangerous creatures that can be summoned by wizards.
A very long time ago, the Blades were dragonslayers, and we served the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer.
About a year or two ago, some fella named Wyndelius came through; said he was some kind of a treasure hunter.
Afraid not. But if you're serious about sharpening that tongue, you might try the Bard's College in Solitude.
Ah, but nobody wants that, right? Painful for you, annoying for me. So, you pay my fine... and you walk away.
Ah, Camilla. Fair as the morning sun. But I ask you, how could she prefer your brooding to my romantic tunes?
Ah... To be honest, no. But High King Torygg supported them, and now her lady Elisif has thrown in with them.
Allow me to introduce myself: Razelan. Imports and exports, by trade. Observer of human nature, by avocation.
And that's on top of noises from the marsh in the night, tales of monsters, and now this wizard in our midst.
And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no moooooree... when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!
And, once more, I prove Commander Maro the fool. I told him you can't stop the Dark Brotherhood. Never could.
Anything that confirms that Thorald isn't dead, but is being held captive. I know those Battle-Borns have it.
Are you sure? I'll need to ask them to take an oath to leave their old life behind and stay here from now on.
As a result, we both feel that you'd make an excellent replacement for Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild.
As an act of good faith on your part, I'd advise that you consider donating an amount of gold to the College.
As far as the Guild's concerned this is between Sibbi and Maven, so we're going to officially stay out of it.
Awful damn cold up here. And only the guests are allowed inside. Damn foreigners and their inhospitable ways.
But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate the altar. Until you came.
But getting both sides to agree to a truce will be difficult at this point. The bitterness has gone too deep.
But it's more than our honor at stake here. Think of it - the first dragon seen in Skyrim since the last age.
But moving on to business. As you probably already know from reading the letter... you're going to a wedding.
But now what? I can't just walk away. Not with my friends' bodies in there, being torn apart by those beasts.
But rest assured. We've won Skyrim's right to determine her own future. And for that, every Nord praises us. 
But this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean. Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams.
But this pitiful, limited body wasn't meant for hunting. Slow. No claws. Weak, mashing teeth for chewing cud.
But, I think, he became too focused on just how much power he could acquire. That's what led to the accident.
But... he has forbidden me from saying his name. He says it distracts him, and woe to those who draw his ire.
But... I rather thought that if I were to help, I might... Well, I might be allowed to return to the College.
By the almighty Divines. You've come. You've actually come. This dreadful Black Sacrament thing... it worked.
By the gods, it's true, isn't it? A dragon has attacked Whiterun. How could mere men bring down such a beast?
Can't say I've heard of any laws against... whatever that is you're doing. But I'll lock you up if I have to.
Come now brother, don't act all high and mighty. I know you could care less about the war one way or another.
Consider it just more of the dirty work. I did my part getting them in there, now you need to clear them out.
Course there's the Orc. Long-term tenant, that one. For what he pays, I could afford to shut this place down.
Dagur and I have an understanding. He gives me privacy, and I make sure my experiments don't blow up his inn.
Deliver the message to the warring parties. If they will listen, I will do what I can to bring them to terms.
Do not delay. Alduin must feel the tremors in Time by the Scroll's presence here. He will know what it means.
Do you think the Stormcloaks will sit idle while this dragon is slaughtering my men and burning down my city?
Don't even say such things! I hope that dragon stays away from Riverwood. We don't need that kind of trouble.
Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here she is. Now what is it that you want?
Elisif mourns her husband deeply and she feels that a festival that burns a King in effigy is... distasteful.
Enchanted weapons, tomes of ancient knowledge, Shalidor's secrets themselves -- who knows what we could find!
Everyone's been worried since you and Mercer haven't shown up in a while. Brynjolf even went out to find you.
Froki won't let me hunt on my own yet, but he never shuts up about killing his first stag when he was eleven.
From what I hear, you're the one gave the Thalmor a black eye. Sure know how to pick your enemies, don't you?
Gavros had to cart it all the way back to Cyrodiil. Left the rest of us here to fend off the damnable Falmer.
Ha! You've done it! Got to admit, I wasn't sure you could pull it off. But you've definitely earned your pay.
He never stays there, just pays for the upkeep on it. Hired some lout by the name of Vald to guard the place.
He told me once that he wanted me to grow up and be a sailor, 'cause that's where our family name comes from.
He was killed. Guards said it was just a madman, but everyone knew the murderer was a member of the Forsworn.
He's going to give you the poison to use on the pests, but you're also going to dump it into the brewing vat.
Hello, my friend! If you seek knowledge about mighty Talos, you have most certainly come to the right person.
Here are my notes about them. I'll gladly pay you for getting the pieces any way you can. No questions asked.
Hmm... looks like it's all here. Okay, go on through. But stick to the road, and don't make any sudden moves.
How do you do it, Valindor? How do you work at Black-Briar Meadery and the Fishery without getting exhausted?
I already told you. They call me Dirge, 'cause I'm the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground.
I always have bedlam jobs. Just remember to hit them fast and don't let them see you. Feel like going for it?
I am concerned about the Jarl's safety. Too many of our guards have been redeployed to fight the Stormcloaks.
I came here as a hatchling. The only thing colder than Skyrim is the Nords themselves, but we stick together.
I can provide you with help for her minions though.  This should help you deal with the Catacombs themselves.
I can't believe she dragged me all the way to this snowball. I'd rather be broke in Cyrodiil than broke here.
I didn't tell you this. Faleen likes to act tough, but she really has a soft spot for, of all things, poetry.
I do what I can to see that Idgrod's time isn't wasted, and that she only has to deal with important matters.
I don't care what the Imperials say -- when Ulfric Stormcloak died, one of Skyrim's greatest heroes was lost.
I fear this truce will not last. General Tullius will be looking for any opportunity to regain the advantage.
I hope I can hear the screams. But don't let on it's from me! And I'm not paying your fine if you get caught.
I know the Guild doesn't do much to foster faith, but I'm going to have to ask that you continue to trust me.
I said move along. The Forsworn are just a bunch of madmen. We have everything under control. Stay out of it.
I suppose you'd better show that to Tolfdir nonetheless. And please, ask before tampering with anything else.
I think we need to prepare for the worst. The coffers are dwindling and I can barely keep our contacts happy.
I was apprenticed to Balimund before he died. He taught me everything I know about forging armor and weapons.
I'd go looking myself, but uhh... Yes, there are calculations to double- and triple-check. Many calculations.
I'll round up what men I can, and meet you outside Northwatch Keep. We'll get in and out as fast as possible.
I'm afraid I'll have to take that Staff from you now. Ancano wants it kept safe... oh, and he wants you dead.
I'm glad we've finally restored the Pale. It was extremely foolish giving the Empire control of another port.
I'm going to stop. That's what I'm going to do! Then everyone will see that I'm not as useless as they think.
I'm sorry to drag you into Markarth's problems, but after that attack in the market, I'm running out of time.
I'm sure Riverwood will be all right, dear. When the Jarl learns what's happened, he's sure to send soldiers.
I've been doing this a long time, remember? While the Thalmor's been looking for me, I've been watching them.
I've been here longer than most of them. Even I don't know sometimes. I just hope they don't kill each other.
I've half a mind to ask if you'll take me on one of your adventures, but I can't just leave Valga on her own.
If the Greybeards were willing to host a peace council... then maybe Ulfric and Tullius would have to listen.
If the Key isn't returned to its lock in the Twilight Sepulcher, things will never be the same for the Guild.
In continuing with our theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic.
Interesting. Keep your ears open for me and tell me if you hear anything more. I'll make it worth your while.
It only takes but a moment to say a silent prayer to Mara. Please come by soon; not for me, but for yourself.
It will have to do. Besides, if it came to blows, I'm sure the Snow-Shod's would come out here and assist us.
It's a clan of giants. The war is driving them out of their lands, and they've started attacking settlements.
It's true, it's true! The Night Mother has spoken! The silence has been broken! The Listener has been chosen!
Just ask whenever you're ready to take on a dragon. We will send the Blades to help you fulfill your destiny.
Kust is my assistant. He helps me tend the headstones and keep our cemetery clean, as befits a place of rest.
Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the Guild. They respected Karliah, and she deserves better.
Listen, you should go to Solitude and join up with the Imperial Legion. We could really use someone like you.
Look, I never needed treasure. My father owns land; our family is wealthy. I just wanted adventure. Not this.
Look, I told the client you probably had a good reason to kill the mark, but well, they demanded reparations.
Looks like the damned rebels got here first. No matter, we have the element of surprise. Prepare to move out.
Losing the Rift gives Tullius easy access to the south of Eastmarch. Talos preserve us. We must take it back!
Many Stormcloaks will fight until they die, because they still believe they're fighting for Skyrim's freedom.
Maramal thinks he's so smart; tells me that Mara will cleanse the filth from my blood. Ha! What does he know?
Markarth is off the table. Your rabble is on the verge of defeat. We have no need of a truce at such a price.
Maybe I'll make the Potage le Magnifique, hmm? You may have killed the Gourmet, but true artistry never dies.
Meanwhile, my very capable steward sees to the needs of the smallfolk and ensures that my hold runs smoothly.
Moved right in and made themselves at home. Did it overnight. I'm not even sure exactly where they came from.
My lord, our provisions are running dangerously low. Our stores of meat, wine and grain are all but depleted.
No, it's not as simple as that, but the Jagged Crown would be a potent symbol for his cause to rally around. 
No, only members of the Circle get this blessing. Right now we're just seeing if you're worth keeping around.
No! Get back! It's still here somewhere! Hroki and Tor just got grabbed when they tried to make a run for it!
No. Can't say there was. My parents died when I was young. You and the Legion have been my only family since.
No. We're completely exposed. Bows and arrows are in short supply. Every building is made of thatch and wood.
Not that I require validation, of course. There are just some - and I shan't name names - who would disagree.
Obsessed with it, really. Nobody paid much attention back then. I guess he wasn't as crazy as we all thought.
Of course he cares. You just have to understand that your father was a soldier and he'll always be a soldier.
Of course! I mean... assuming you don't want me to kill someone for you. I might have to draw the line there.
Of course! I undersand completely. You just put us in a room, and I'll do all the talking. No worries at all.
Oh my. You would do this for me? Here, take it. I don't want anything to do with this wretched thing anymore.
Oh really? Hmm... this looks like someone from Staubin's little group. A brave scholar, but not very wise....
Oh, Fastred. I'm not sure what happened. One moment she's smiling at me, the next I can't even meet her eyes.
Oh, I'm sorry, did I imply that you'd be meeting for purposes other than court business? You must forgive me.
Oh, what's this? Fort Snowhawk is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those...
Oh... what a terrible shame. Well, if you think you know where you left it and can retrieve it, I'll be here.
Once I've made enough money trading with the Khajiit caravans, I'm going to buy the Bannered Mare from Hulda.
Only this. You have the Thu'um of a dovah, but without the wings of one, you will never set foot in Skuldafn.
People are having nightmares they swear are real. They go to bed, but they wake up more tired than yesterday.
Poor Cicero. Dear Cicero. Such a humble servant. But he will never hear my voice. For he is not the Listener.
Praise be to Talos, this is a glorious day for Whiterun and for all Skyrim! Our liberators have come at last!
Purchase more supplies, then. That's your job as Steward, isn't it? Why do you trouble me with these details?
Should have left when you had the chance, friend. Now we're gonna have to spill your brains on the road here.
So this is what passes for Imperial craftsmanship. Try not to sneeze, or you might bring the whole fort down.
Soon enough I'll have you back under the headsman's axe, and this time there won't be any dragon to save you.
Sorry, I don't have a single septim left after paying the town guard to keep quiet about the mark you killed.
Steel. Barehanded. Armor. Naked. It's all fighting. I can kill you with a weapon or by myself. No difference.
That I do. If you want to grab a pickaxe and dig up some iron, feel free. I'll pay for anything you bring me.
The [QUOTE]problem[QUOTE] is your disrespect for the laws of this land. It's time to face the Jarl's justice.
The Blades have been hunting him for centuries, but he was protected by the Greybeards and then the Emperors.
The choice is yours, friend. We're all counting on you to make the right decision. Put him out of our misery!
The difference between a noble band of warriors and a ragged bunch of assassins is as thin as a blade's edge.
The magical energies underneath the College still require purification. Your assistance would be most useful.
The objective here is simple, you simpleton!  Use your Wabbajack to defeat the enemy, while they do the same!
The same thing we've told them before, and the same thing we've told these Stormcloaks. It's not our concern.
The struggle between Olaf and the dragon culminated in a mighty duel atop Mount Anthor, with Olaf the victor.
Them Imperials left me to die in Anvil, and I had to fight my way back home. Then they followed me back here!
There are a few great strongholds worthy to talk about. Dushnikh Yal, Mor Khazgur, Narzulbur, and Largashbur.
There's a small parapet, just opposite the balcony, that would prove an excellent spot for a long-range kill.
There's a strange rock formation, built by the ancients. Something about that place attracts the Ice Wraiths.
There's an axe. An incredibly powerful axe. An axe powerful enough for me to have quite a bit of fun, indeed.
There's been a group called the Companions for over 4000 years. It's been many different things in that time.
There's no doubt Mercer will make for the borders of Skyrim. I hope you find him before he escapes our grasp.
There's only one place that could be. The place where she murdered Gallus... a ruin called Snow Veil Sanctum.
These priests weren't threat to the Skeleton Key or the conduit to Nocturnal's realm, so they were tolerated.
They are only a little late, Jarl. The trade routes are affected by the war, we should give them another day.
They weren't gone somewhere for all these years. They were dead, killed off centuries ago by my predecessors.
This old place? Been here forever. Built by my great grandda. Run by him, then all the way up the line to me.
To be honest, I doubt someone would be stupid enough to make an attempt on Maven... sorry, Jarl Maven's life.
To get the answers you seek, you must travel to the top of the mountain and speak to our master, Paarthurnax.
Try and get those marks without violence please. I don't want to be responsible for their deaths... or yours.
Uh. Hey. That weapon there is just for show. Right? I mean, you aren't going to hurt me or anything... right?
Ulfric is our rightful High King. He's leading the fight to drive the Empire out of Skyrim, once and for all.
Until you can do those formulas with your eyes shut, you'll never be ready to master the more difficult ones.
Vittoria may be pretty, but does she have the right hips for the job? I want grandchildren, and lots of them.
We don't have the luxury of hanging back to see who wins before choosing our friends, Bryling. You know this.
We keep the Reach safe. We flood Markarth with wealth, but does the Jarl listen to us when we want a say? No.
We provide clothing for all of Solitude's most... influential residents. But for you, I'll make an exception.
We were an assassins guild that was sanctioned by the Empire to provide public as well as private executions.
We're taking the city. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.
We're taking Whiterun. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.
Well done, sister. If you can hold these Imperials to their promises, we might be able to reach an agreement.
Well, after a while my father caught on to what I was doing. He confronted me one night and gave me a choice.
Well, it appears your actions are startin' to make waves out there. People are talkin' about the Guild again.
Well, looks like you completed the contract as directed. Finally. A little sloppy, but, well... done is done.
What a curious question. Well, I enjoy moonlit nights, taking long walks on the beach, knitting and unicorns.
What? Of course I know who you are... I didn't mean to suggest, that is, I don't remember even saying that...
What's new with the Cruel-Seas, Suvaris? Have they given you one of those helmets with the horns on them yet?
What's with all the boots and shoes you keep buying? You must have bought twenty pairs in the last two years.
When the weather permitted, Aerin and I would often walk the Rift's forests. The trees here are so beautiful.
When word came that he'd fallen, his son Deroct lit the candle in his honor. Nobody knows why it still burns.
Where is it? I know you were trying to keep it for yourself J'zhar... You always try to keep it for yourself!
While you're on my boat, you follow my rules. First rule is, don't touch anything that doesn't belong to you.
Whoa, lass. I'd do just as well drawing a blade across my own neck. Where did this foolish request come from?
Windhelm is divided into four quarters. The Gray Quarter is the one that's home to all the city's Dark Elves.
Without it, I feel almost as defenseless as a newborn. I don't think I'll ever be able to find a replacement.
Working our mine is dangerous work, but Dravynea keeps it going. Well, Dravynea and the promise of more mead.
Yes, we did have a bit of a... break-in. But we still have plenty to sell. Robbers were only after one thing.
Yes. Hofgrir took me in when I arrived in Riften about a year ago. He's been teaching me everything he knows.
Yes. Their history and culture is all around us in Markarth. A race of stonecutters, artisans, and engineers.
You are a guest of the College, here at the pleasure of the Arch-Mage. I hope you appreciate the opportunity.
You know, some nights when I close my eyes, I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there...
You made it in. Good. As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open this door and we can get you on your way.
You needed to do this clean and quiet, and you failed. Now we need to use your payment to cover your mistake.
You never know what you'll find laying around in a crate or barrel. People toss the darnedest things in them.
You should be more careful about the women you spend time with in port. Come back later and it will be ready.
You should do as he says. Go to Malacath's shrine, northwest of here, and ask for his help. See what happens.
You slaughtered the very people you claim to be fighting for! True sons of Skyrim would never do such things.
You want to give me money? Just like that? Fine, but I intend to earn that investment. I don't need handouts.
You. You aren't with the Forsworn, are you? People say they saw you when the prisoners escaped. So many dead.
You'd better get to Riften. Ask around the Ragged Flagon, in the Ratway. It's at least a good starting point.
You're a disgrace to the Empire. To think that you're actually the representative of the East Empire Company.
You're awfully inquisitive, aren't you? I like that. Perhaps you'd care to solve a little problem I'm having?
You're not going to goad me into a fight so I'll get kicked out, Grelka. Eat your food and leave me in peace.
You're right, you're right. I just... I was sure it must have been them. If not the Thalmor, who? Or... what?
...is there singing in the Void? Dancing...? Surely the Dread Lord will at least allow poor Cicero to caper...
A conquering army. Ruthless mercenaries. A band of drunken louts. And the esteemed company you see before you.
Absolutely not! I protest... uh, that is, yes, of course. I still don't understand what just... oh never mind.
Adara bends the silver so naturally. Grandmother would have cried if she saw how deft our daughter has become.
Ah well. At least I have all the comforts of home during my stay. Well, except the touch of a woman of course.
Ah, I forget how little you know of the dov. Our names are always made up of three Rotmulaag - Words of Power.
Ah, indeed? There's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. Let me think...
Ah, yes. Solitude. Seat of the High King of Skyrim. Messy business, kingslaying. Ah, but so very satisfying...
And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity.
And that's as it should be. In the darkest days ahead, it'll be us Nords who lead the fight against the elves.
And truth be told, since Torygg's death, he had no real power in court. But still... He didn't deserve to die.
And with the rebels thinking us occupied elsewhere for the time being, we'll be able to take them by surprise.
Any Nord can learn the Way of the Voice by studying with the Greybeards, given enough ambition and dedication.
Any time I get tired of working, I just think that maybe that next swing will make me rich. It keeps me going.
As some of you may know, Saarthal was one of the earliest Nord settlements in Skyrim. It was also the largest.
At this point they don't care what happens to her and neither do I. Best to just kill her and be done with it.
At this point they don't care what happens to him and neither do I. Best to just kill him and be done with it.
Became obsessed with the Dwemer. Took off north saying he had found some old artifact. Haven't seen him since.
Begone, World-Eater! By words with older bones than your own we break your perch on this age and send you out!
But he's a dangerous man. It's why they call him [QUOTE]the Unliving.[QUOTE] I wouldn't approach him directly.
But in time, I made the right friends and proved myself useful enough that they don't give me trouble anymore.
But please, don't leave. You've been instrumental in this process. I'd like you to see the results first-hand.
But she's not going to get the better of me, oh no. I won't let it get to me one bit. That's what she's after.
But the leaders of the uprising refused our offers of peace. They fled into the hills and became the Forsworn.
But, I will honor your request. The gods know of your victories, and they themselves will glory in your deeds.
By the gods, you're diseased. Get yourself to the White Phial and purchase a remedy, before you infect us all.
Calm yourself, Breya. We are closing in on the Lexicon. I can feel it calling. We'll continue without Drennen.
Candlehearth Hall is running low on our famous mead. Can you drop off this case? The gold is yours, as always.
Don't let them intimidate you, sister. We both know how to keep our heads while the men let their hearts rule.
Don't you sweet talk me, Alvor. Not after last night. I'll bring you water when I'm done with my other chores.
Everyone else though.... They're horrible. Imagine dying over and over again in your dreams night after night.
Exactly. Road patrols were cut in half because the Jarl needed soldiers. Now the bandits are bolder than ever.
Excellent! Thank you... Here, take this as, um, a sign of my gratitude. It's not much, but I hope it's enough.
Few outsiders earn the right to enter our strongholds. Speak with more respect, or we might forget your gifts.
Fly, my hunter. There are others who vie for my favor. A bit of competition. Don't dally while the prey flees.
Follow me, and keep your eyes open. Daedra are powerful creatures and tricksters. Never know what you'll find.
For an outsider like you to be accepted, an Orc would have to make you Blood-Kin, and send word to the chiefs.
Good. I'll spread the word that you've made reparations. Now let's forget the past and get back to business...
Good. You could be our first line of defense since you live outside the city walls, so we're depending on you.
Got ourselves a freelancer thinks he can muscle in on our territory. How about you teach him some manners, eh?
Grelka, I wanted to talk about that suit of leather armor you sold me. The fasteners are already coming loose.
Guess the Empire's going to need plenty of iron what with all the fighting. That'll be good for us, I suppose.
He has knowledge of a cult of Talos. He will tell us what we need to know, or he will die. The choice is his. 
He sent out a party to scout the area. They happened upon a large force... I'm told none of them made it back.
He was told to run the scam on merchants, but he smelled the gold on you and his judgment went out the window.
His spirit is departed. Members of the Circle, let us withdraw to the Underforge, to grieve our last together.
Hjerim is a fine house, and it's up for sale. You should talk to the steward in the keep if you're interested.
Hold it. This here's a toll road, see? Yer gonna have to hand over, say, 200 gold if you want to use our road.
However, I can assure you that I will do everything in my power to keep you safe if you're willing to help me.
I am Larak's daughter. Soon, I'll be of age and will be sent to marry an Orc chief in some distant stronghold.
I can't wait around for you to make up your mind. I'll meet you at Kynesgrove. Don't waste time getting there.
I cannot tell you in detail. I never heard it used. Kogaan. It was the first Thu'um created solely by mortals.
I didn't have a choice. When the Red Mountain erupted in Morrowind, the Tong fled... spread to the nine winds.
I don't care if you're best buddies with the Guild Master. I'll still smash in your skull if you try anything.
I don't think anyone deserves that kind of abuse! I've known plenty of elves who were perfectly decent people.
I got this for you. It's nothing big, but I hope you like it. I want you to know I appreciate your friendship.
I guess what I'm sayin' is, Ulfric stood up for us, an' for all Skyrim. So who's goin' to stand up for us now?
I guide the Companions. The Circle advises me. But we are all free warriors. Only our honor binds us together.
I just think Elgrim's taken it upon himself to mentor the young thing so he focuses a lot of attention on her.
I miss the glory days of this place. We had more coin stacked in the vaults than we even knew what to do with.
I never would have thought, but Uglarz is an even better hunter than Yatul was. The things I'm learning now...
I once captained a ship called the Argent Raptor. She struck an iceberg and went down, just north of Windhelm.
I said give me some meat. I'm hungry, and the Divines know you don't need more food in that huge gut of yours.
I say this without bitterness, for it was Ri'saad who saved me from a life of servitude aboard a trading ship.
I suspect the treaty that ended the war was just a tactic to buy time so the Thalmor can rebuild their armies.
I take my duties as Housecarl very seriously. I won't hesitate to shed blood if my uncle Vignar is threatened.
I think it's time we make this Guild Master thing official. Go and talk to Brynjolf, he's makin' preparations.
I thought we were taking Ulfric back to Cyrodiil, but I guess the General changed his mind. You know the rest.
I was about to show him the error of his ways when he made a curiously astute comment about my research notes.
I was there. I fought in the Great War. I was on the field at Anvil. And when I was struck down, they left me.
I was, to my shame. The whole court was in attendance. I've seen much in my time, but that was a gruesome day.
I wish I could, milady. Sadly, I haven't sold enough of my own jewelry let alone buy some from you. I'm sorry.
I'd had Eorlund forge this for Thorald. It was to be a present for his return. I suppose he can't have it now.
I'd like to give you this tome...it's one of Sinderion's greatest works. I believe you've more than earned it.
I'm almost certain he'll reach the Imperial City tomorrow, so we should have an answer by the end of the week.
I'm aspiring to earn that title, yes. However, the road ahead is paved with loose cobbles and deadly pitfalls.
I'm collecting ingredients to bring to the Gourmet. He'll think my tastes so refined when I offer them to him.
I'm just protecting Bryling's investment. She's the owner, even though we're the ones here doing all the work.
I'm one of General Tullius's agents. I was sent to investigate the Treasury House and the Silver-Blood family.
I'm surprised you had the wits to notice, Olfrid, what with your nose buried so far up the Emperor's backside.
If you bring it to me, I'll grant you my boon. No strings attached. No messy surprises. At least, not for you.
It all started here. This rebellion. When the Empire lost the Reach during the Great War, we became desperate.
It feels good to finally have a chance to help these people. Helplessly watching them suffer's been difficult.
It seems this damnable conflict has claimed everyone's passions of late. Me, I prefer my books, and my spells.
It would seem there's some sort of disturbance. From what few details we were given, it sounds quite familiar.
It's also very illegal. Anyone caught with Balmora Blue looks forward to rotting in jail for a very long time.
It's that Braith girl again, isn't it? Has she been bothering you again? I've a mind to speak with her mother.
It's very important to Huki that all the battles are fair. What's more important to me is that my pay is fair.
J'zargo has worked hard on learning new spells, trying new things. This will make J'zargo stand out as a mage.
Jarl Balgruuf? He rules Whiterun Hold. A good man, perhaps a bit over-cautious, but these are dangerous times.
Leave me out of your intrigues, Hrongar. If you have something to say to the Jarl, say it with you own tongue.
Like it or not, this College is a direct influence on the public's impressions of magic and those that use it.
Look at this craftsmanship! These old halls fill some folk with dread, but as a Nord, they fill me with pride.
Looks like we're in for quite a harvest. We've had better luck with our planting than any village in the hold.
Malyn's soul is beyond hope because his body is dead. But I'll be keeping you just slightly alive on this end.
Maramal's been helping me through a rough patch. I just wanted to pay him back. It's not like he's keeping it!
Maven sent word that you discovered something else while you were out there. Something important to the Guild?
May I ask what all the honey's for? I mean, you used to buy almost a jar a week. Are you cooking or something?
May they journey forth together in this life and the next, in prosperity and poverty, and in joy and hardship.
Maybe you haven't heard, but the Thieves Guild is back. Windhelm is their city now, if you catch my meaning...
Men ran and they cowered, and they fought and they died. They burned and they bled as they issued their cries.
Miss Grelod is... well she's a terrible old crone. No person could be that cruel. I think she's part hagraven.
More bad blood between the houses. Fralia is convinced our family is somehow at fault for the loss of her son.
More work? My friend, you still haven't finished the last two contracts I gave you. Let's get those done, hmm?
Mostly it is the Nords. They do not like outsiders in their land, and so we are forbidden to enter the cities.
My father's been haunting me ever since he died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad he's here.
My parents were traveling merchants eventually settling in Cyrodiil. I must have inherited their wanderlust...
My predecessor, Askar, found me in Hammerfell. I was serving as bodyguard for some weak-necked lord out there.
No harm shall come to me, for I live under Azura's wisdom. Her foresight protects me. Her insight sustains me.
No, I guess not. Well, the principle applies here. It's a potion, made from those dragon parts. Give it a try.
No. Not yet. After all, a dragon... something out of old tales and legends... no one could have expected that.
Nothing new there. Most of the Nords living in Windhelm don't care much for us, but Rolff is the worst by far.
Nothing you need to concern yourself with. I shall be quite capable of observing everything that goes on here.
Now that we know they're tied in to some sort of necromantic ritual, I think I know when the next might occur.
Now you have my Oghma Infinium. It contains the knowledge of the ages as revealed to Xarses, my loyal servant.
Of course not! What will you offer for Riften, Tullius? Some empty promises? Maybe some more Imperial bluster?
Of course, sent by... what is it that she's calling herself these days? Shazra? Saadia? One of those, correct?
Of course! I know, today wasn't the best introduction to the Legion, but I hope you'll give us another chance.
Oh, no. Err, wouldn't do to say at all. Not, err, not now. Not at all. I have far too many things to do still.
Oh! Finally! When I heard the Gourmet was being brought in to cook for the Emperor, I could hardly believe it.
One day we were cracking rocks in the deepest parts of the mine and the next day they were all over the place.
Secondly, how can anyone forget wards? They have become essential to any mage working in dangerous situations.
Since Brynjolf assures me you'll be nothing but a benefit to us, then you're in. Welcome to the Thieves Guild.
Skald supports Ulfric's rebellion, and he doesn't like having a couple of old Legionnaires living in his town.
So if you're willing to perform one more service for the Company, we could put this matter behind us for good.
So, the whore thinks the Black-Briar reach ends at the border of Skyrim, eh? She'll soon discover her mistake.
So, what do you think, my dear? Could a beautiful woman like you ever see yourself with an old codger like me?
Some people can't be trusted to accomplish anything that's asked of them. They don't take pride in their work.
Something as specific and ancient as the Staff of Magnus... I'm not sure we'd ever find something like that...
Stand next to me. Master Borri will open the gate. Use your Whirlwind Sprint to pass through before it closes.
Start changing it over to the Black-Briar Meadery West as soon as possible. That was Maven's part of the deal.
Stendarr's Mercy to you. If my Horgeir doesn't give up the mead this time, I'll hit him over the head with it.
Take my word to the leaders of your guild and tell them we look forward to a prosperous and profitable future.
Take this reward. I managed to sneak some of my wealth out of Hammerfell when I left. It's the least I can do.
Taken care of that layabout Deekus, yet? Or does the idea of killing a fellow Argonian make your scales crawl?
Tell you what. If you need any stolen goods fenced, you bring them to me and I'll pay you good money for them.
Tell your men to stand down. I don't need any help dealing with this kind of fool. He isn't worth the trouble.
That is a fine idea. The stronghold would need the gold when I left to marry, anyway. I am ready when you are.
That is absolutely untrue! Uh, that is, yes, of course. What... I don't understand why everyone... never mind.
That is commendable. But remember, the Dragon Blood is itself a gift of Akatosh. Do not try to deny that gift.
The Blackblood Marauders haven't been seen since the Icerunner attack, so my shipments have been more regular.
The captain inherited the Sea Squall from his mother when she died. Maybe I can inherit the ship if he dies...
The Dunmer get their drinks at the New Gnisis Cornerclub. Why they can't just call it a tavern is beyond me...
The Empire exists because we allow it to exist, and I'm here to make sure the Jarl of Markarth remembers that.
The final tempering of the Phial was performed with a type of old magic that's been lost since the Dragon War.
The Forsworn aren't our real concern, defeating the Imperials and making sure we keep control of this city is.
The love of the land and her people flows from your heart, even as death to her enemies flows from your hands.
The objects you see here might look mundane at first glance, but I assure you, behind each is an unusual tale.
The rest of my men are already assembling outside Korvanjund. I'll meet you there as soon as I finish up here.
The Thalmor ambassador, Elenwen, regularly throws parties where the rich and connected cozy up to the Thalmor.
Then Ulfric Stormcloak came with his militia. That must have been a sight to see, him shouting folks to death.
Then you were well informed. I am at this very moment on the cusp of completing my magnum opus on the subject.
Then, girded with certitude, plant the ceremonial blade deeply, so that the waters of his heart wash over you.
There's a grate outside the wall. Looks like it used to be buried in snow. I don't think they know it's there.
There's times I think you're the coldest man in Skyrim. This is your own flesh and blood you're talking about.
They always hope to teach the Dragonborn to respect the Way of the Voice as they do. They never fully succeed.
They just call themselves the people of the Reach. Lot of common blood with the Bretons, by the looks of them.
They took his shield to those Hagraven beasts they consort with. I need you to bring it home where it belongs.
They're almost... real. They say a priest of Mara has arrived in town. We'll see if faith can cure this curse.
This again? I told you we have someone standing guard out there. And, don't forget the rock trap we rigged up.
This place is filthy. I've a mind to cancel all town privileges unless those brats start pulling their weight.
This time, the General turned the tables on him. Ulfric rode right into our ambush with only a few bodyguards.
This was the last great bastion of the Dragon Cult, and their leader's mask was reported to be quite powerful.
Thus they may claim that the Synod is indeed a political minority in the Empire and should be treated as such.
True mastery of the Voice can only be achieved when your inner spirit is in harmony with your outward actions.
Truth be told, I'd be more comfortable if I were back there. I get nervous in the company of so many worthies.
Ulfric Stormcloak was a true hero of Skyrim. He stood up to the Thalmor and refused to turn his back on Talos.
Until then, I train. My new home will need strength, and my new sisters must know I am not weak when I arrive.
Used to be a lucrative underworld commodity when Balmora was still standing. Now the stuff is beyond valuable.
Verner, you should have come out with me yesterday. I found the most amazing tree growing right out of a cave.
Very well. Meet me at the summoning circle in the marsh at dawn. We shall banish the creature you have become.
Vile! None of that - you made a deal, and the mortal stood by it honestly. Now it's your turn to come through.
We are devoted to the Goddess Mara, who gave mortals the gift of love that they might have a hint of eternity.
We did! Keep your eyes peeled. I don't think we're alone. You check the entrance. I'm going to look over here.
We ought dig a big hole, throw all them dark elves and Argonians in it, and let 'em tear each other to pieces.
We used to be known across Tamriel as the protectors of the Septim Emperors. Those days are long gone, though.
Well done, brother. If you can hold these Imperials to their promises, we might be able to reach an agreement.
Well, for that much, I don't think Malacath would turn his scowl on me. All right, outlander. My axe is yours.
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's too early to be getting excited. Still, this is most encouraging.
What do I care about Sovngarde? Give me the power to tear my foes as a beast of the wild, and I will savor it.
What do I do to deserve such hatred? You give people good food and good prices, and all they do is insult you.
What is it... what has happened to the Gildergreen? I have traveled long here to worship beneath its branches.
When Aventus escaped, Grelod was so mad. I got double the beatings that day. But that won't happen ever again.
When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines. I don't know how, but he lives.
Windhelm's a bit cold for my tastes. And I ain't talking about the weather. You're not from Windhelm, are you?
Without training, you have already taken the first steps towards projecting your Voice into a Thu'um, a Shout.
Woman, you'll be the death of me yet. Fine, take your time. I'll just die of thirst in the heat of this forge.
Yes. They chose me when I was just a lad. It was a great honor, of course. I was to become a Greybeard myself.
You are ready to learn the final word of Unrelenting Force, [QUOTE]Dah,[QUOTE] which means [QUOTE]Push.[QUOTE]
You assured me this place was clean! I'll see... see to it that you remain in irons for the rest of your days!
You know that our supply is limited. It could be a season or more before we get a new shipment from the south.
You see, here he is falling from the sky. The Nord Tongues -- masters of the Voice -- are arrayed against him.
You'd think that'd be the end of it, but those Forsworn are still in the hills, and they're as wild as wolves.
A person who is looking for a spouse simply wears an Amulet of Mara about the neck, showing they are available.
Absolutely! Now I can reabsorb his body, and return to full power. All without having to listen to his whining.
Ah, a wanderer, yes? No? Pilgrim, perhaps? Have you come to commune with Peryite, Taskmaster and blighted Lord?
Ah, I was beginning to think the day would never come. So you broke the binding spell, did you? Matters little.
All right, keep your voice down... you want everyone to hear you? I'll let you in, just let me unlock the gate.
All right. But before I can put you to use, I need to know how much you can take. I have a little test for you.
And had they succeeded, Dawnstar's fate would be sealed. You have a unique way of looking at things, my friend.
And who are you to challenge me? I have conquered mortality itself. I've spat in the eyes of the Daedric Lords.
Another case of mead needs to find its way to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. The delivery fee is yours to keep.
As for you, General Tullius, I see now that Galmar was right. Talking to the Empire is just as useless as ever.
As one of our city's most influential citizens, she's has taken it upon herself to oversee their incarceration.
At the time, it was difficult to keep food on the table, let alone have enough left over to sell at the market.
Aye, he does indeed... and with his fingers in the East Empire Company's pie, we'll make good use of that debt.
Aye, the bard's got talent, I'll give him that. You just make sure his music is the only thing you're admiring.
Bashnag cursed me. I can't cast a spell to save my life right now. I'll have to wait until the way out is safe.
Be careful where you step in the mine. Don't want to cover up some valuable ore, or gems, or... Or something...
Besides, the Thalmor reward their friends richly. Anyone who doesn't take advantage of that is a stubborn fool.
But I cannot travel to Malacath's shrine. The ritual must be done here, and I do not have the materials I need.
But just as Paarthurnax's later deeds do not expiate his crimes, your deeds do not allow us to ignore our duty.
But no, Dovahkiin. Others do not come here to train anymore. Saraan. You are the first in over a hundred years.
But rest assured, citizen. We'll put an end to this uprising... and things will get back to normal soon enough.
But... well, they did. Sacred, they said. So we work the mines until we've worked it off. Fair enough, I guess.
Can you believe that this hold used to contend for the throne of the High King? Now perhaps others will listen.
Carlotta put you up to this, didn't she? I'm sorry, but that fiery widow is mine. She just doesn't know it yet.
Down in the Ratway Warrens. Nice place, if you don't mind the stench, rats, and assorted lowlifes as neighbors.
Enthir is once again holding out on me. He refuses to deliver yet another item absolutely essential to my work!
Even I'll admit it hasn't been the Empire's finest hour. But it wasn't like the Emperor had any choice, did he?
Everyone is in agreement, so all I can do now is name you Guild Master and wish you good fortune and long life.
From ship's captain to lowly crewman... I suppose I deserve it after wasting all my coin on gambling and women.
Good. They've had their victories, but Tullius is no fool. The Empire can't afford to keep this up much longer.
Have you spoken to Erik? His father won't let him go out and seek his fortune in the world. Maybe you can help.
Haven't you been listening to me? All the old tales agree that he has some means to travel to Sovngarde itself.
Here, here. For your troubles! Shiny, clinky gold! A few coins for a kind deed! And thank you! Thank you again.
Hmm. Well now. Yes, this might actually be something interesting. You'd better show that to Tolfdir right away.
Hmph. He had a trip to Skyrim planned for months, and canceled at the last minute. Much to his cousin's dismay.
However, since it wouldn't behoove me to make you disappear, I'd rather have you on my side as Thane of Riften.
I don't believe it. Someone sticking up for us. Here. It's a week's wages for me, but you've earned every coin.
I don't know. All we can do is hope the Eight will favor us and have these creatures stay far away from Riften.
I doubt Ulfric would let Thalmor into Windhelm without a fight. But please, do continue. How would you help us?
I found them near the old Dwemer bridge in the far west. I'll mark it down for you on your map for a small fee.
I have much to thank you for, little one. When you die I will raise you and you can take your place by my side.
I have no doubt that we still hold her favor and I believe it gives us enough of an edge to defeat Mercer Frey.
I heard there was a Priest of Mara who was supposed to be looking into it. We'll see if anything comes of that.
I know old men sometimes have pains in their legs when they rise from bed. I know a few spells that could help.
I know. I just don't want you to leave; you're the only good thing that's happened to this city in a long time.
I mean, I knew the Dark Brotherhood was good... just not that good! You killed the old hag before I even asked!
I mentioned how the Star is a soul gem, only it never gets depleted? There's another rule the artifact follows.
I set up those targets a long time ago. I shoot at them from time to time. Don't want to get rusty with my bow.
I suspected as much. The real question now is do we do something about it ourselves or do we speak to the Jarl?
I told you I don't like you going there. I've seen scavengers picking at the mammoths. They could be dangerous.
I told you. I'm done with all that. There's enough blood on these hands. I'm interested in creating things now.
I want out. I want to leave this place. I long for the fresh air of the Reach. This place only makes us sicker.
I was making my way down the road from Ivarstead towards Riften, and I saw Vex fighting off a couple of wolves.
I was meant for so much more than all of this... I wish to pledge my life and ply my talents in darker circles.
I wish your mother were still alive. She could answer you much better. Let me think on it and we'll talk later.
I wouldn't have expected someone like you to be the Harbinger, but Kodlak trusted your judgment. And so will I.
I wouldn't wander here alone at night. Folk go missing around Chillwind Depths, the cave just over those falls.
I...I miss our son terribly, especially since Eorlund died. Thorald... he went missing, fighting the Imperials.
I'd also warn you not to cross her. She employs quite a few... troubleshooters  to take care of messy problems.
I'm glad Ralof is helping drive them out of here. If I was a bit younger, I might have joined the fight myself.
I'm impressed. Forsworn usually make short work of mercenaries, but you took care of them. Here is your reward.
I'm just running some errands for the old man... Err... For myself. I'm just running some errands for myself...
I've also received word from Markarth. It would seem Anton Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good.
I've been trying to find new areas of business, trying to win the sailors' respect, but I keep having problems.
I've got a letter and a lot of gold. Something about it being your inheritance? Oh, and... sorry for your loss.
I've picked up some new clients and did a few jobs on my own, but I'm not sure if that will cover our expenses.
I've seen some truly wondrous sights since I took to the seas. I had no idea a man could die in so many ways...
If I can make enough money here in Skyrim, I think I'll travel to Hammerfell and see what work I can get there.
If it's a mercenary you're looking for, you've found him. There's no stronger sword-arm for hire in all Skyrim.
If she's come this far from home, it must be important. Lead on. I just need to report back to camp by sunrise.
If we win. This war is going to drag on for years. I can feel it. We need to prepare for a long struggle ahead.
If you want to get in on that action, find Brynjolf in the marketplace. I'm sure he could use someone like you.
If you're going to need live test subjects for your experiments, it's easier to do that off of College grounds.
Imagine hearing a story like that, over and over. Each time a different family Each time a different injustice.
In fact. Keep it. I must have used up the magic in the staff or something. It's just a dumb stick of wood now. 
In southern lands, he was known by the name Tiber Septim. Here in Skyrim, we honor him by his proper Nord name.
Indeed I did! For a few septims, I'll tell you about some of the most interesting curiosities in my collection.
It pains me to see this locket... to be reminded of  Fjotli once more, but I'm glad it's back where it belongs.
It would please me if he'd take up arms and fight for to save his homeland. Is that too much to ask my own son?
It's all true, I swear it. You can hear it when it's done. I'll just need a year or two smooth the rough edges.
It's nice to receive good news for a change. Did you recover anything else from the warehouse worth mentioning?
Jurgen Windcaller's mastery of the Voice eventually overcame all opposition, and the Way of the Voice was born.
Know your place, mortal. Or Molag Bal may just send another champion to claim his mace from your broken corpse.
Look, before I have you help track Mercer down I need to know what you learned from Karliah. I mean everything.
Look, I know the others think I'm a bit daft for sayin' stuff like this, but I'm gonna give it to you straight.
Lot of people looking for him. Don't know his name, but he's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here.
Magic? That's dangerous. You want to learn that, go to that College in Winterhold. They teach that stuff there.
Malyn's soul should be in the Star. Theoretically, purging him will be just like killing a ghost anywhere else.
Maybe so, but bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. We need to show Tullius we won't be pushed around.
Miss Temba is much happier now that you took care of those bears. She may not look like she is, but I can tell.
More importantly, upon your death, your spirit will be bound to the Twilight Sepulcher as one of its guardians.
No. I have enough trouble without more mouths to feed! They're the Jarl's men, they can eat supper at the keep.
Nords are so serious about beards. So many beards. M'aiq thinks they wish they had glorious manes like Khajiit.
Not hate. Distrust and fear. The Blades have always sought to turn the Dragonborn away from the path of wisdom.
Not well I'm afraid. That Brynjolf... he keeps draining the people's pockets with his ridiculous miracle cures.
Oh, dearie, it was so long ago. But I do remember the celebration we had afterwards. Mead never tasted so good.
Once you get your hands on it, I want you to plant it in Captain Volf's footlocker. I'll take care of the rest.
Or maybe you missed the demented little man in the jester's garb, down by the road? Goes by the name of Cicero?
Our little girl died recently. I've been shouldering my days with strong mead, but nothing gives my Tova peace.
Perhaps my prayers were answered and your reason for stumbling across Dawnstar is more than a mere coincidence.
Perhaps, perhaps not. Dragons are not like normal mortal creatures, and Alduin is unique even among dragonkind.
Romantic, isn't? Like that time we first met. Remember that? Never seen so much blood. Ah, to be young again...
Seen enough magic in my day to know to stay away from it. I'd stay away from the Jarl's wizard in Dawnstar too.
Septim would later found the Empire that united Tamriel, but his first known battle and victory was right here.
Several months ago I ordered a special silver mold from some artisans in Valenwood by way of a Khajiit Caravan.
She... really? That's... I wouldn't have dreamed. Of course, we need her in Markarth, then. I'll come with you.
So getting the guards to throw me in here as a [QUOTE]punishment[QUOTE] was about as easy as falling off a log.
So many refuse to talk to us. They call us thieves and smugglers. I am glad to see that you are not such a one.
So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. It's as if the very stars have finally aligned.
So you see, I have to return it. It breaks tradition, and I need to tell him that I finally did what he wanted.
So, when he was made Jarl again, he didn't wait a moment to name me his Steward. He said I was the only choice.
Sometimes the famous come to us. Sometimes men and women come to us to seek their fame. It makes no difference.
Sorry isn't good enough, Orthus. There's a lot of gold at stake here, and sniveling isn't going to get it back.
Sure is. I've got another client -- wants me to do some enchanting. You can do the pick-up for me, if you want.
That was over 500 years ago. Nothing much down there now - but everyone's always convinced the cave is haunted.
That's how I consoled myself for years, after I'd sealed this place shut and vowed never to let anyone open it.
The Empire is man's last bastion. If Ulfric wasn't blinded by lust for power, he'd see we are on the same side.
The fiercest of the remaining rebels will continue to harass us, but by in large, the people here desire peace.
The only time I've heard it mentioned was when those Synod characters showed up some months ago looking for it.
The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform.
The soldiers are some of our best customers, for we offer supplies and wares they cannot obtain by other means.
The writing in the book describes the destiny of its reader, so the words change from one person to the next.  
There is no distinction between debate and combat to a dragon. Tinvaak los grah. For us it is one and the same.
There were three of us. Myself, Gallus and Mercer. We were a anonymous splinter of the Thieves Guild in Riften.
There's an Altmer who's staying at the Frozen Hearth. Nelacar. You should speak with him, if you're so curious.
There's another report of a disturbance in that Hold. Best if it's taken care of before things get out of hand.
There's another report of a disturbance in this Hold. Best if it's taken care of before things get out of hand.
There's some trouble in Falkreath. There's always some sort of trouble down there, but now it's come to a head.
There's still the matter of Paarthurnax. I'm not ungrateful for what you've done. Esbern speaks for both of us.
They used to be pretty feared around here. I mean, you'd whisper the name and it'd send chills down your spine.
This is our stronghold. Here, we are free to live as Malacath intended, away from the prying eyes of the Nords.
This was such a glorious city. But then everything had to change. The Empire came... and my brother was lost...
To this day I've regretted allowing her to escape, even if it meant I had died trying. I owed Gallus that much.
Ulfric's not running a social club. You don't join anything. Either you're a true son of Skyrim, or you're not.
Unless Mara wishes to come down and help me with these urchins, I don't really give a damn about her blessings.
Vald said his rowboat struck some rocks... I'd check under the water near one of the small islands in the lake.
We both own the Pawned Prawn together, but he's singlehandedly kept the place running despite all our problems.
We found this in the Jarl's treasury after we captured the capital. I thought you should be the one to have it.
We'd better go make sure that bastard is really dead. Collect us a trophy or something to bring back to Ulfric.
We'll drive out the Empire from this land that we own. With our blood and our steel we will take back our home.
We'll drive out the Stormcloaks and restore what we own. With our blood and our steel we'll take back our home.
We're... at odds about my charity. She thinks the people in this town have become lazy and expecting a handout.
Well met. I don't think they're hiring anyone at the moment, so if you're looking for work, you're out of luck.
Well, there is something. There's a guard, patrols the road that crazy jester is on. He passes by pretty often.
Well, with the Falmer skulking around I can't very well do this on my own. I guess you'll have to come with me.
What is interesting is that it appears he was also incredibly prolific, writing on a diverse array of subjects.
What's not to get? It's as simple as Traven's First Axiom of Magic... or was it Galerion's Law of Casting. Hmm.
When Aventus escaped, Grelod got meaner than ever. I really thought she was going to kill one of us. Guess not!
When we're done rooting out Imperial influence here at home, then we will take our war to the Aldmeri Dominion.
Whiterun seems like a better choice to me. From there we can threaten to undermine the whole Imperial position.
Without the Night Mother, there is no Dark Brotherhood. The Matron deserves our unwavering support and respect.
Yeah, got to admit that little jester is good with that butter knife. But don't worry, I gave as good as I got.
Yes, yes, I know. I just wish to show them there's more to life than drowning your sorrows in a goblet of mead.
Yes. For Sithis... and the Night Mother. You are the Listener after all, hmm? So let's not waste any more time.
You can tell Cicero I'll be along presently. I just need to do a couple things here first, and gather my tools.
You haven't heard of the civil war in Skyrim? I guess down in Cyrodiil people have other things to worry about.
You may have seen the open grave in our graveyard. Most of the townsfolk think it's the work of a corpse thief.
You must be one of the new apprentices, then? Fine, fine. Just... just don't make a mess of my work, all right?
You should probably just take this directly to Faleen. Wouldn't want the old icebrain stumbling over the words.
You will summon a Dremora, and order it to bring a sigil stone to you. I will then inscribe the spells for you.
You'll need to talk to Jorleif, though. We can't just let anyone go around claiming to be on official business.
You've headed down the path of dreams. Unfortunately for you, Pelagius suffered night terrors from a young age.
Your concerns are duly noted, Legate, but unfounded. I assure you, this war will be over in another six months.
...mead, mead, mead... ...kill 'em to get some beer every now and then? ...stupid bees and their stupid honey...
A book of mine. I was at least halfway through, and wanted to finish it, but apparently I put it down somewhere.
A close friend of mine. We fought together on the battlefield for many years until old age got the better of us.
Ah, the ceremonial juncture. The old Nords used to do sacrifices here. Look around for a way to open those bars.
Ah! You made it! Good to see you, my friend. I'll never forget how you saved my life from those Thalmor maniacs.
All right, please stay close to me while we're inside. It should be safe, but it's always better to be cautious.
All right. Got a simple one. Just get in, change the books and be back in time for last call. So how's about it?
All you need to know is that the Psijic Order is a rogue organization, believing themselves to be above the law.
Am I! Free food and wine, and nobody trying to throw me in the dungeon. I wish they did weddings here every day.
And now you must perform the task for which I created you. You have already proven to possess the needed skills.
And then we were all fighting just to survive. None of us were prepared. It was amazing the rest of us survived.
And there are the villains - those that misused their power. There's always a choice, and there's always a risk.
As a token of my esteem, I have instructed Avenicci that you are now permitted to purchase property in the city.
As I've said, I made some progress using the essence of dragon scales. But they're just not quite potent enough.
Aye, that I do. Have all my life. We Battle-Borns have been here since the beginning. Along with the Gray-Manes.
Aye, that's what the Falmer were known as long ago... before they became the blind monstrosities they are today.
Be sure and investigate Radiant Raiment's fine selection of clothing. We have many items you'll fancy, I'm sure.
Because the rituals would last for months or even years, the Miasma was designed to slow down the aging process.
Because this is the end for them, the Stormcloaks will fight like cornered rats. They will be fierce and crafty.
But I'll be ready when a new leader takes up the cause. As sure as ice is cold and stone is hard, I'll be ready.
But mark me well -- I will purge the heresy from this land as surely as the flame burns the flesh from the bone.
But no! We are farmers! We are craftsmen! We are sons and daughters of shopkeepers, maid servants and soldiers! 
But they also stole Finn's Lute. We just learned where the bandits fled to, and I very much want that lute back.
But, ahh... It's effective. Three times, and the crystal should be ready for the next step. Isn't this exciting?
By Shor, you're hauling around a lot of junk. Best stop in at the Arnleif and Sons Trading Company, sell it off.
Can't believe Madanach is on the loose again. I hope those rumors I'm hearing about your part in that are wrong.
Cicero destroyed any sympathy I may have had for him when he wounded Veezara. Kill the fool and be done with it.
Damn it, this never should have happened! We knew better. We knew better, and still we let our guards down. Agh!
Do not fail Kodlak. He's earned his place here, and does not deserve to fall prey to Alduin's insatiable hunger.
Do you think those dark elves had anything to do with the murders? The attacks all happened at night, after all.
Does it matter? You're warm, dry... and still very much alive. That's more than can be said for old Grelod. Hmm?
Don't know his name, but there is a guy like that hiding out down here. Paid plenty for nobody to know about it.
Don't worry, my love. Just show the bugs your adoring face, and they'll scurry away in complete fear in no time.
Eehhh... no. Sorry. But I did notice that her coinpurse was still intact, so whoever did this wasn't after gold.
Even if these carvings tell us where the crown is, I'm sure we're going to have to find a way through this door.
Everything is wrong! Everything! Whatever you have at that College has completely interfered with our work here.
Excellent, then they'll be no need to devote any resources to stopping it. Thank you, Anuriel. That will be all.
Falkreath is our home, a place where we have good jobs under a good Jarl. Until the war comes to us we stay put.
For an alchemist like myself, it is the most pure expression of my art. To create from nothingness is... poetry.
For the last two hundred years, since the last Dragonborn emperor, the Blades have been searching for a purpose.
Good. Follow me. We have to fight our way up. I don't think anyone else here is about to have a change of heart.
Guards and Jarls can be bought. And the Alik'r are close; I'm running out of time, so I'm choosing to trust you.
Have you given my idea any more thought? You said you'd let me know yesterday, and that obviously didn't happen.
He promised a paradise awaited his followers when they died, that they would be reborn by Mehrunes Dagon's side.
He stays in the Pelagius Wing of the Blue Palace. The doors are locked, and only Falk Firebeard can grant entry.
He was a dear friend of mine and a surprisingly astute pupil of academia... I was devastated when he was killed.
He was a scholar, a master thief and a natural leader. Everyone respected him and followed him without question.
He was one of the strongest we had, but numbers can overwhelm. He should not have come without a Shield-Brother.
Hey, if you find it, I could show you some of the clan's favorite fighting moves. They're all shield techniques.
Hey, this guild needs the coin... walkin' away without takin' work is not going to make you popular around here.
Hmm. Yes, it is quite sad. A young boy, Aventus Aretino, lost his mother recently, and was sent to an orphanage.
Honor me with a task, outlander. Bring the sword to my daughter, if you see her. It'll be all she needs to know.
I anticipated the problem. While you were arranging this meeting, I was busy in the library of Sky Haven Temple.
I could really use some more experience in the field. I'd be happy to join you again, and it won't cost a thing.
I do some business with the trade caravans, and I've picked up a number of items from adventurers like yourself.
I do. Sadly, I'm one of the few traditional Saxhleel Jewelers that remains in Tamriel; it's becoming a lost art.
I don't think so. How do I know you won't continue to extort me? A wagon full of gold isn't good enough for you?
I feel the hunger inside of you. Gnawing at you. You see the dead and your mouth grows wet. Your stomach growls.
I hate her. Everyone hates her. She's the meanest person I ever met. Sometimes she even locks us in the... room.
I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?
I hear one of them, Nelacar, still hangs around the Frozen Hearth. Guess he has no where else to go, poor thing.
I heard a traveler say that Helgen was destroyed by one of those creatures. Didn't leave a soul alive they said.
I hope you weren't expectin' to get paid for this blundered job. Next time, the mark stays alive... you hear me?
I used to look forward to the day when I was of age, to see new places and people, but now it feels like a cage.
I was a member of the court during the reign of Torygg's father. It was Torygg who appointed me to the position.
I'd do jobs for the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood, but if things didn't go as planned, I was on my own.
I'd like to offer you a place in my court, as a Thane. It's mainly an honorary title, but there are a few perks.
I'd recommend heading to Whiterun, just down the road from here. From there you can take a carriage to Solitude.
I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now.
I'll give you credit for boldness. But associating yourself with the Blades is a choice you will come to regret.
I'm glad to be rid of him. Even if it does mean I'm stuck in this pitiful shrine, in the back end of... nowhere.
I'm not sure whether it's the soil, the climate or the favor of the Divines, but we've never had a poor harvest.
I'm so glad Vittoria and Asgeir chose a public reception. That way the entire city can share in their holy bond.
If people aren't tired, they're angry, and if they aren't angry, they're afraid. It's made keeping order a mess.
If the owner cuts the Guild out of the picture, he's cutting Maven out of the picture... which she can't afford.
If we can make a name for ourselves in Skyrim once again, I can almost promise you those merchants would return.
If you really are Dragonborn, like out of the old tales, you ought to be able to Shout. Can you? Have you tried?
If you want to help, I suppose you could head to Windhelm and talk to Orthus Endario. He's in charge over there.
If you're here to report any instances of corruption, be confident that we're handling these rumors accordingly.
In any case, if I can't get past the creatures in that room, I can't recover the treasure. I need more manpower.
In the end, we took back Markarth, but those damn Forsworn still stalk the hills and roads, looking for revenge.
Is that so? You should be. Though a heart without fear is something I can use... Perhaps you are the one I seek.
It's not the most exciting place in the world, but the people here work hard and don't cause trouble for anyone.
Karliah has provided me with the means to be rid of you, and this ancient tomb becomes your final resting place.
Let me at least give you something for your efforts... finding all of these couldn't have been easy... or cheap.
Looks like something one of the dark elves would wear. Ask Revyn Sadri, he probably sold whatever it used to be.
Looks like you've got some help already. I'll join you, but you'll have to let your comrade go. What do you say?
Mages based out of Cyrodiil. They fancy themselves the Imperial Authority on magic these last few hundred years.
Many have died taking up arms for this cause. I fear that the land will be stained with blood for years to come.
Maven was down here right before you got back and she was all smiles. Haven't seen her like that in a long time.
Meet me outside Fallowstone Cave. You clear the way to the giant for me, and I'll make sure you get paid for it.
Mortal. I am Namira, the Lady of Decay. Your consumption of the blood and bile of Arkay's own is pleasing to me.
My bloodin' days might be over, but my son Idolaf is out there fightin' for Skyrim! Fightin' for the Empire! Ha!
My dear vagrant, we're the only family worth knowing in Markarth. We own everything in this city, even the jail.
My father told me he found me as a young boy in the wreckage of a ship that sank off of the coast near Solitude.
My mother was a strong woman... she's the one who instructed me on my swordfighting techniques. Can you imagine?
My mother's been haunting me ever since she died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad she's here.
My scouts have tracked down one of the Forsworn leaders, hiding out in their blood-soaked camps. Deal with them.
Next, instruct your thrall to touch the Pillar of Sacrifice. Its magic will ensnare him, rendering him helpless.
No, you can't ever be too paranoid where the Thalmor is concerned. Look what happened to the Blades. The Blades!
Not enough to bother with it. Arch-Mage Aren's approach to these things is to just let them sort themselves out.
Now at last, the Thalmor will get their way. The worship of Talos will finally be stamped out. Or so they think.
Now that's the real question, isn't it? Because honestly, how much time off could a demented Daedra really need?
Now they kneel, their ancient mission fulfilled, as the Last Dragonborn contends with Alduin at the end of time.
Now, it's time to get your feet wet and I don't want to waste a lot of time talking about anything but business.
Oh stranger! You have made Cicero so happy! So jubilant and ecstatic! But more! Even more! My mother thanks you!
Oh, and when you find Esbern... if you think I'm paranoid... you may have some trouble getting him to trust you.
Oh, come now. You didn't really expect to manipulate people forever, did you? Your luck had to run out sometime.
One of my main duties is to foster a better understanding between the Aldmeri Dominion and the people of Skyrim.
One of my predecessors was a good, but short-sighted man. He made a bargain with the witches of Glenmoril Coven.
Painting won't put food on the table, but our crops will. Be patient Aduri... it will happen someday, I promise.
Passably. Aia is my star pupil. None of the others can hold a candle to her. Especially not that wretched llldi.
Perhaps if I were a little more blessed I could afford to give away my fruit. As is you'll have to pay, Rorlund.
Probably for the best. It will give me time to see if that old trap still works - and break the news to the men.
Reyda would gather ingredients from the small island in the river east of here. Then one day, she just vanished.
Riches and fortune, within my grasp, and I have to give it all up because they're afraid of a few dead bodies...
Riverwood's in danger, too? You'd better go on in. You'll find the Jarl in Dragonsreach, at the top of the hill.
Savos wouldn't even grant us an audience when we came to you, but now you come here expecting something from me?
Sibbi will prove to be a fine leader one day, but Ingun... that girl has her mind somewhere other than business.
So the clues point to the Treasury House, then. That makes sense. Thonar is involved in every facet of the city.
So, as I was saying, the first thing to understand is that magic is, by its very nature, volatile and dangerous.
So, this is Nightingale Hall. I heard about this place when I joined the Guild, but I never believed it existed.
Some are saying the Psijic Monks have been seen in Skyrim. They're an ancient order. I had 'em figured for dead.
Someday, I hope we can get away from here... perhaps move back to Morrowind. This isn't at all what we expected.
Somethin' just ain't right about that Sybille. You know, I've never seen her eat a thing? That can't be natural.
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude but Jouane's the one who deals with people. I'm afraid I lost my charm years ago.
Stupid Lars Battle-Born. I fight him almost every day, but it's not much of a fight, 'cause he don't fight back.
Sure. How about you mind your own business about it, and I won't have to get Dirge to toss you into the cistern?
Taking control of the Rift was a great victory. Ulfric must be rather nervous with us so close to his door step.
Tell Delvin that he can count on me to provide the influence around here with the right people when he needs it.
Tell you what. Go ahead and deal with your business for now. When you're done, find me and we'll deal with mine.
That'd be the College in Winterhold. I suppose you'll be headed there, then. Well, don't let me get in your way.
The dark elves and Argonians won't soon forget Ulfric's prejudice, but I'm doing what I can to repair that rift.
The first time? Thieving. The second time? Thieving. The third time? Thieving. It kind of keeps going like that.
The folk of the Empire have always had a more cosmopolitan view of the world, so I'm glad to see them in charge.
The Forsworn haven't been kind to Karthwasten. I've heard rumors that they've attacked this place without mercy.
The Imperials silence us because they fear us! They are cowards! Cowards and fools who have forgotten the truth!
The Imperials were waiting for us. As pretty an ambush as I ever saw. We were outnumbered five to one, at least.
The infighting had taken months to subside which gave her time to go into hiding and carefully cover her tracks.
The inner sanctum lies ahead. We must reach the Skull and put an end to Dawnstar's troubles. Lead on, my friend.
The Jarl has advised me not to talk about which court attendants I'd like to punch in the face. More's the pity.
The Keeper is a sacred position within the Dark Brotherhood. Ask yourself - do you trust the wisdom of our Lady?
The matter at hand is urgent. Alduin must be stopped. You wouldn't have called this council if you didn't agree.
The Night Mother is part of you now! You get to hear voices inside your head! The rest of us should be so lucky.
The Nords of those days used the Dragonrend Shout to cripple Alduin. But this was not enough. Ok mulaag unslaad.
The only thing you need to know is that they almost destroyed the world, and they were stopped. A long time ago.
The rumors say the culprits are vampires. I try not to listen to swaggle like that, but figured you should know.
The Stormcloaks are here in force. Stick close and follow orders so we don't stir up the whole place against us.
The vessels contain that very blood. Empty them and you remove any chance he has of regaining his former powers.
Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius's request? I mean, if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric...
Then you know the hard looks as judgment gets set upon you. The sneers of people who never had to face sentence.
There is no greater madness than those who seek to become vampires. That's a dark bargain if there ever was one.
There's no greater honor than to serve. If you're serious about enlisting, speak to Legate Rikke in Castle Dour.
There's some company I certainly prefer over others. Have you met Mikael? The most amazing bard I've ever heard.
They're shadows of their former selves. They no longer remember their true purpose or their original identities.
They're the high elves that rule the Aldmeri Dominion. Sworn enemies of the Empire and everything it stands for.
This is High Hrothgar, our temple, sanctuary, and home. We ask that you respect our solitude while you are here.
Those boots aren't worth the septims I do pay them. I'm not giving them coin I could give to good, Nord workers.
Ulfric can tell you more than most anyone. He was studying to be a Greybeard himself, back before the Great War.
Unbelievable! You must be the first person to set eyes on all twenty-four of them in... well, the last two eras.
Until then, tell the people of Markarth that their dead won't be disturbed, anymore. We have bigger plans ahead.
Voada, you spilled laundry water in the soup pot again! Do I need to cut off your fingers to teach you a lesson?
Wait, where did you get this? This piece was thought to be lost forever, please take this with my utmost thanks!
Way I hear it, Elsweyr ain't nothing like Skyrim. It's got tropical forests and dusty badlands. It sounds awful!
We are all trapped in Alduin's web - for our allegiance he cares not, but devours us equally - doom unescapable.
We do what we do out of love for our brothers and sisters. Here, take this as a token of such love reciprocated.
We're taking the capital. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.
We've got something of a love triangle here in Riverwood. Faendal and Sven, both vying for Camilla's affections.
Well, that's good to know. I suggest you tell your people at the College to keep a tighter leash on their mages.
Well, what happens now is you start your new life in the Dark Brotherhood. You're part of the Family, after all.
Well. You surprise me. I was expecting you to favor Ulfric. Maybe this council will achieve something after all.
Well... yes. I mean, all of the gold didn't come from me. I have a silent partner that helped with the finances.
What do you want from me? I work for them ok? We're not friends. They pay me, and I get the job done. That's it.
What I'm talking about is true control, mastery of magic. It takes years, if not decades, of practice and study.
What? Who is this, Brother? Another of the smooth skins looking for food? But this one wasn't trapped with us...
When a new government takes charge, records can be lost, taxes can be forgotten and laws aren't always enforced.
Why would I do that? For money? Because I swore an oath? No, it was because he was a good man and a true friend.
Yeah, I was lucky though. After Vex tore the guy to pieces, she gave me a potion. If she hadn't of been there...
Yeah, walk away like a good doggie. Just stay out of the Black-Briars' business and maybe we'll give you a bone.
Yes, yes. I'm your brother and I'm supposed to greet you respectfully. So [QUOTE]hello.[QUOTE] There, satisfied?
Yes! It's not perfect, but it's a close enough approximation that it should certianly suffice for initial tests!
Yes. A map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear.
You are pleasant company, more than pleasant. And what about you? Would you... be interested in a life together?
You can get out there and start making a name for us again... make them start fearing us like they did long ago.
You didn't touch it did you? Well no, of course you must have! Did you attempt to wield it? And you're not dead?
You said you the ceremony was going to be in Morvunskar. You said your friend Sam was going to be your best man.
You're hardly throwing her to the wolves. She just wants to see the world... just like I did when I was her age.
You're right, I saw it. But... how's that possible? Dragons don't exist... they're just stories from long ago...
You've not only earned your payment, but my respect as well. And believe me, friend - that does not come easily.
A sale? To attract new customers? Camilla, everyone in Riverwood already shops here. There are no more customers.
A true Nord would settle it himself, but at least this way Iddra gets her coin. Thank you. Tell her I'll be fine.
About 30 years ago, the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Empire. It was a surprise attack, caught everyone off guard.
Ah, but Skyrim! Skyrim is supreme among all nations! Our people, our native people, are unmatched in all Tamriel!
Ah, the Potage le Magnifique. So delicious. My friends, as Emperor, I of course reserve the right of first taste.
Ah, there you are. Good, I was done speaking with that muttering fool anyway. We've got some business to discuss.
Also, I recommend hitting the training room if you need lockpick practice. Helped me out of a jam more than once.
And it's just as I suspected. The energies need to be channeled back through the nexus a second and third time...
And perhaps some day, you'll join us in that battle. But for today, return to Jorrvaskr. Triumph in your victory.
And to think, Mirabelle questioned my allowing you into the College. I can just imagine the look on her face now.
And you... you're coming with me to Dragonsreach. We'll see how quickly your memory clears in the city's prisons.
Anything. Served in the Legion with my sister, Ghorza, for over 10 years. We've seen every piece you can imagine.
Are you blind, or just stupid? You think the tribe has not seen you talking to me? You think they would not know?
As long as you don't mind going axe-to-axe with a bunch of Daedra-worshipping savages who practice the dark arts.
Attic room, eh? Well... we don't have an attic room, but you can have the one on the left. Make yourself at home.
Aye. The Great Hunt killed old King Borgas. Gods only know with what profane arts those elves cursed his remains.
Back from your little vacation in Falkreath. So, did you enjoy the sights, sample the food... kill the housecarl?
Because even if we can't openly worship him, Talos the god was once Tiber Septim the man, and this is his Empire.
Besides, I wouldn't want to be the one to give it to him. Gives me the creeps. They say he dabbles in necromancy.
Bit by bit, we bring honor to this land. And you've brought honor to the Companions. More importantly, some gold.
But let me warn you - joining the Legion is for life. Any previous loyalties... I trust we understand each other.
But never mind all that. We're the Emperor's soldiers. We'll do our duty no matter what stands in our way, right?
But the Daedra are the worst. Their callous disregard for our lives is abhorrent in the eyes of the God of Mercy.
But who am I kidding, I know you wouldn't let me leave, brother. You truly believe in Orchendor and his promises.
But you don't have to stay, if you don't want to. I'll see you back at Jorrvaskr. Stories to tell the others, eh?
By gods' jest in this grim mist together snared, Stormcloak and Imperial, we wander hopeless, waiting for succor.
By the Eight... you actually got your hands on it! This alone is worth more than some thieves earn in a lifetime.
Calcelmo's orders- no one gets through to the tower. Kill any intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need to.
Can't see why we let them dark elves live inside the walls. We should kick 'em out like we did to the scalebacks.
Come on now, we discussed that. I wouldn't be traveling all of Skyrim. It'd just to Whiterun and back, that's it.
Depends on what you mean by [QUOTE]busy.[QUOTE] I'm also the head jailor in the dungeon here. Quiet job, usually.
Did she, perhaps, mention any dangerous research she might be working on? Anything that could get her in trouble?
Do I detect a bit of jealousy in your tone? I would hardly blame you. What calling could be more noble than this?
Don't bother. I don't have much chance of seeing my husband these days. He's always up in the palace with Ulfric.
Don't interfere with Imperial Legion business. Now move along, unless you want three inches of steel in your gut.
Each reader sees different reflections through different lenses, and may come away with a very different reading.
Enjoy that axe! And don't worry about poor old Barbas. After all, he really should have picked a better friend...
Everyone's been talking about you. The guards will have to answer for throwing an innocent person in Cidhna Mine.
Excellent. Now we can get back to business. I think it's best we just forget this ever happened and move on, hmm?
Excuses are not acceptable in my court. When I ask for something I expect results, and I expect them immediately.
Filthy Argonian never would have set foot in this city, if High King Torygg was still alive. I can tell you that.
First of all, one of our men was captured by rebels who refuse to surrender him. So we're going to break him out.
First off, there's an Orc hanging around causing me headaches. Something about a vision quest he needs help with.
From the time she's a little girl to the moment she expires, she is a direct connection with the heavenly mother.
Good to see you again, friend! We've opened the mine back up. If you're here for work, I'll buy any ore you have.
Good. Here's the outfit. Try to get Elisif's opinion on it and if she likes it mention it's from Radiant Raiment.
He said I was transporting weapons! For the war! In mother's coffin! He made me... open it! Indignity! Sacrilege!
He's begun a rebellion against those that wish to eradicate the worship of Talos and uses it as his rallying cry.
He's the housecarl of Falkreath. You know what that means? He's the bodyguard to the Jarl himself. So be careful.
He's too stupid to remember where he was, and any attempt I've made to find it in the past has been unsuccessful.
Here, consider these yours. And the Arch-Mage's quarters as well. I shall be here for advice, should you need me.
Here, this should suffice as your cut of the... or rather, a reward for your actions. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Here. Something I want you to have. Now, don't embarrass either of us by saying something sappy. Just... take it.
Here's what's going to happen. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, and you're going to leave me alone. Deal?
Hmm. The fearless wife and mother, and the underhanded Khajiit. Had to be one of them, right? Interesting choice.
Hmm... If you happen to recollect anything about the incident, you be sure to report to the captain of the guard.
I actually owned a shop in Vivec City long ago, but I had to leave all that behind when the Red Mountain erupted.
I am Hermaeus Mora. I am the guardian of the unseen, and knower of the unknown. I have been watching you, mortal.
I am honored to have been chosen to lead. But I know that being picked by Malacath does not mean that I am ready.
I am Keeper of the Vigil here in Skyrim. We bring Stendarr's Mercy to the innocent and His Justice to the Daedra.
I could run this ship better than that boy who calls himself a captain. Maybe one day I'll do something about it.
I don't have any money to give you. but I can show you a few tricks I learned playing for the Winterhold wizards.
I heard about the attack on Jorrvaskr, and the killing of your honored leader. You have my sympathies, Companion.
I knew he was troubled but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me.
I need you to help me show him the error of his ways by sneaking on board the Sload and planting some contraband.
I pledged to aid Avulstein and Thorald a long time ago. There's nothing that could keep me from helping them now.
I see I still have much to learn. If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time.
I shouldn't agree to terms that so blatantly favor the Empire. I have no choice, though, under the circumstances.
I stayed with my father in the woods until I was old enough for my Trial. We hunted everything there was to hunt.
I told you, I can't just pick up and leave. I have my wife, my business... not to mention you have the Bunkhouse.
I would not sell it to just anyone but I'll make an exception for you. The cost to replace the gem is quite high.
I'll also notify the guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now.
I'll give you money. Treasure. I have some things hidden away. Take them all. They're yours. Just please... stop.
I'll remember that when the Stormcloaks liberate the city. No amount of money will protect you then, Battle-Born.
I'm not your enemy. I already gave you the horn. I'm actually trying to help you. I just need you to hear me out.
I've been running interference for you around here. I don't think anyone's caught on to our little campaign. Yet.
I've done my part, Dragon Bridge will have extra guards. Falk Firebeard will find a way to take care of the cave.
I've heard Riften's home to the worst Skyrim has to offer. I hope we don't run into any trouble while we're here.
I've really missed traveling like this. Walking the breadth of Skyrim has always filled my heart with excitement.
I've risked life and limb so that you may create another masterpiece. Make sure to think of me when you use them!
I've seen him sneaking over to the Riverwood Trader to speak with her when I'm not around. He's wasting his time.
I've spoken to Karliah, and made amends for how the Guild's treated her. Now she wishes to speak with both of us.
If not for Paarthurnax, Alduin could not have been overthrown. It was he that first taught men to use the Thu'um.
If you must venture southwest, stay clear of Volskygge. It is a cursed place, a tomb where the dead still live...
If you see Reyda, tell her that Narfi misses her and to come home soon... very soon. Soon... soon, like the moon!
Imperials? Well, if they're keeping themselves comfortable, let's slip in and send them to their graves that way.
It means that the Burning of King Olaf, which the Bards College has held for time immemorial, won't be happening.
It was my idea to replace one of the key elements with our focusing crystal. Months of enchantments went into it.
It was one of the great houses in Morrowind long ago. Whether that means I was one of them or not, I'm uncertain.
It wasn't created for the Nightingales. It was created to test those who wished to serve Nocturnal in other ways.
It would seem our adversary is attempting to take us apart indirectly by angering Maven Black-Briar. Very clever.
It's exhilarating to observe the effects of my potions on the body. Watching the heart stop... the eyes go blind.
It's pretty simple. Ulfric founded the Stormcloaks years ago, as a sort of private army to advance his ambitions.
It's probably meaningless to you, but according to family legend it links our bloodline back to Ysgramor himself.
It's too fine a day to dwell on such things. Let's get back to work and forget about wars and orphans for awhile.
Kyr's orders. Nobody goes in or out until he gets back. Or the boss will skin you soon as he's done with Ra'jirr.
Like a novice picking an impossible lock or a blind man suddenly turning to face you as you reach for his pocket?
Lots of nasty holes in the Reach, and Blind Cliff Cave is one of them. A filthy Hagraven nest, northeast of here.
Lucan over in the Riverwood Trader says thieves broke into his store. Strange, he says they hardly took anything.
Lucky for us it attacked when it did, eh? I wasn't looking forward to getting a shave from the Imperial headsman.
Mark my words. If Bolli thinks he's giving all of our wealth away to some poor slob, I'll leave him high and dry.
Married. It doesn't feel like I thought it would, but I'm happy. Where should we live? You could stay with me....
Maybe you'd like to help me keep up appearances? Old Nelacar has a mage's staff in his room in the Frozen Hearth.
Morthal is still in danger. The journal mentions Movarth, a master vampire I thought was destroyed a century ago.
No. I can't afford to risk both of you. I need you here working on ways to defend the city against these dragons.
No. This coven has existed for thousands of years. Namira is a goddess. She has been worshipped since time began.
Not another delivery. I told you people, our stocks are fine. Now put whatever you have over there, then get out!
Not that it does me any good. Nords think I'm working for the Forsworn. Forsworn think I'm working for the Nords.
Now, if you'll just stand right over there, I'll cast a spell at you, and you block it with the ward. Here we go.
Now, let's go back to the Hall of the Elements, where most of the members gather for lectures and study sessions.
Now, what's he's asking, it's just impossible. Even if it worked, the questions and accusations it would cause...
Oh, but this isn't at all what Mother would want. You kill the Keeper or I kill the Listener? Now that's madness.
Oh, convey my compliments to Delvin for me. Tell him I'll be happy to reopen whatever doors he needs in Solitude.
Oh, yes. Of course... the whole thane thing. I'd forgotten. If you're ready then, can we get this out of the way?
Oh, you may have pleased me, but you have surely pleased the Night Mother. And our mother, she will never forget.
Oh, you mean in that manor house? During the thunderstorm? Heh. What can I say? It happened, just like you heard.
Old Embershard Mine's up there. Used to produce a lot of iron, but collapsed and taken over by criminals, I hear.
Owes me a lot of coin for drinks. I keep telling him not to worry about it, but he's got the stubborn Nord blood.
Pelagius Septim the Third, once the Mad Emperor of Tamriel, now so boringly sane. I always knew he had it in him!
Picking on me again, you backbiting Nord? Tired of those prissy nobles turning down your rotten slabs of venison?
Preposterous, and just the sort of thing I would expect from mages who have nothing better to do with their time.
Sabjorn could use this interruption to his advantage and collect a larger share of the market. I can't have that.
Seek out the beast. He wanders these woods. Bring him down and... well, the Lord of the Hunt should smile on you.
Skald, I've been meaning to ask you for a leave of absence. I wish to return to High Rock until this war is over.
Small clan... maybe twenty men. We'd raid villages, rob caravans... but it was always about the killing for them.
So you think you have what it takes? Huh. Lucky for you, I'm not the one who makes that decision. Talk to Kodlak.
Stormcloaks were already camped out around the entrance when we got here. They don't know we're here yet, though.
Such a waste of time preaching to the poor. If they're that hungry, they should just grow some food or something.
Sure, you can hire a swordsman or a spellcaster to fight at your side, but why not get both for the price of one?
Tell her... tell her to suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. She'll understand.
Tell you what, if you find the rest of them, talk to me again. Otherwise, keep it and maybe it'll bring you luck.
Tell you what. Bring me ten of their pelts from anywhere in Skyrim I'll gladly pay you for thinning out the herd.
Thanks. You and Sam drink too hard for me. Think I'll take my gold and go buy a nice bit of swamp in Black Marsh.
The blood of our fallen heroes will make Skyrim free, never doubt it. Also, never doubt me or Galmar. Now then...
The city's changed, friend. The Thieves Guild is on the rise... and they've got a firm foothold here in Whiterun.
The Companions have been asked for assistance, and we shall answer. Particularly when the pay is as good as this.
The dwarves were masters at subterranean construction... these ruins show  only a fraction of their capabilities.
The Nords may have forgotten their forefathers' respect for the Clever Craft, but your comrades throng this hall.
The only reason we're having this conversation is due to Brynjolf's assurance you won't botch another assignment.
The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot and yet I used it on you.
The safety of the city and our settlements must be our only concern, Igmund. The rest of the Reach is on its own.
The Solitude Lighthouse will be guiding it in... but if its fire were to go out, the Icerunner would run aground.
The source of the poison must be destroyed once and for all, otherwise another dealer will simply take his place.
The tapestries hung here and outside were found in hideouts where members of the Mythic Dawn would meet and plot.
The Thalmor saved all of Elven-kind during the Oblivion Crisis. We've been watching over our lands for 200 years.
The truth, child of Talos, is that the Dragon's children have come! To purge the world in fire and righteousness!
There is nothing else but philosophy to a dovah. It is no accident that we do battle with our Thu'um, our Voices.
They are rare things, I have one I picked up during my research of the Oblivion realms but it is a precious item.
They come in here once a week to clean out the bodies, grab any ore we've mined, and beat down the troublemakers.
They grabbed me in Riften. They seem to think I know something. They just kept asking me the same damn questions.
They promise people they'll kill off all the Nords that rule over the Reach. Nothing but murderers and saboteurs.
They're well-funded and they've been able to avoid identification for years. I'm impressed it reached this point.
This is the last warning. You do it again, and you'll be sleeping in Beggar's Row with the rest of the riff-raff!
Those who fought the Thalmor in the Great War still see an enemy. But that war is over, and a new day has dawned.
True. A pause to consolidate our gains would be useful. And the Empire can afford to look magnanimous in victory.
Unfortunately, we've had to implement more stringent entry procedures, due to some problems with the local Nords.
Usually it's to free someone the client cares about... and sometimes to... well, to kill someone on their behalf.
Verner used to love exploring before we got married. Now he's become a bit of a milk drinker. Likes to stay home.
Very well, I'll make the arrangements. The next time you visit your house, your new furnishings will be in place.
Want to improve your armor? Use the workbench. Make sure you have the right raw materials, such as iron or steel.
We are special envoys of the Aldmeri Dominion, the rightful rulers of Tamriel. If you'd like I can show you why. 
We Gray-Manes have been feuding with the Battle-Borns for years. There's no more bitter enemy than an old friend.
We may be rough, but we don't tolerate thieving around here. If that's your game, go join the lowlives in Riften.
We must maintain order and put the rebellious Jarls in their place, before we have a full scale war on our hands.
We're made up of thousands of parts with thousands of different functions all working in tandem to keep us alive.
Well, I know the Companions make their home here. Their mead hall, Jorrvaskr, is the oldest building in the city.
Well, in the old tales, the Dragonborn heroes would use the power of their Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim.
Well, let's see... travel-stained clothes, worn soles, blank and unintelligent expression... Yes, in fact you do.
Well... I guess you could say I got on his nerves. I tend to be the voice of reason and he finds that... irksome.
What it does with these memories is just conjecture and an argument for scholars and historians to this very day.
What was I thinking? Even if it were true, I'm not setting foot in some ancient tomb, filled with who knows what.
Wherever I can find them. If you're the type who worries over where something came from, you may want to move on.
Whether or not he has truly repented, or merely acted to save himself, justice demands that he pay with his life.
Why a little boy would want to contact a group of murderers is beyond me, but he is inviting evil into this city.
Why don't you be a dear and let me go now. All right? I won't say a word to anyone. Our little secret. I promise.
Winterhold will be turned over to the Empire, although the College itself will retain its traditional neutrality.
Yes. A few months ago I received word from the Night Mother's Keeper that he had arrived in Skyrim from Cyrodiil.
You can see Azura's Shrine for miles on a clear day. You people did a good job with that, I'll say it to anybody.
You need to meet with him and give him whatever you think you can't live without while you're inside the embassy.
You see? The terminology is clearly First Era or even earlier. I'm convinced this is a copy of a much older text.
You should probably just let Faleen read it herself. Don't want you stumbling over the words and ruining my flow.
You there, pretty lady. You need some fresh meat for your family? Just look at the blood coming from this cut....
You think I don't know that? If anyone learned of this meeting, my corpse would swing over Solitude for a decade!
You'll want to watch out for the Forsworn if you do any travelling around the Reach. Bloodthirsty bastards, them.
You're learning, Dragonborn. Doing nothing can be the wisest choice, although strangely often the most difficult.
You're right, of course. But when this war is over, I'll gladly resign and we can stop sneaking around like this.
You've got to kill a soft little woman on her wedding day. What's next? Murdering a crippled orphan in his sleep?
...and I said to the baker, [QUOTE]You're not dead! You're a faker![QUOTE] But if that's your wish, I'll oblige...
Aela's laid claim to your services, and I've learned the hard way not to upset her. Best you stick to her for now.
Ah... here's the [QUOTE]blood seal.[QUOTE] Another of the lost Akaviri arts. No doubt triggered by... well, blood.
All lovely young ladies, too. Let's hope the guards find that demon soon, and introduce him to the headsman's axe.
All right, all right! Take it easy. No idea why you'd care about a stranger so much, but this isn't worth a fight.
All right, remember... this is a clean fight. No weapons, no tricks. And none of those fancy magic spells, either.
And I've waited. Even after the enemies' arrows dug into my chest and their hammers crushed my bones. I've waited.
And of course, don't forget to consult your Home Decorating Guide for descriptions of the decorations you can buy.
And to think that we've been supplying the Greybeards with our own food supplies. What have they ever done for us?
Another fine day at work in the fields. I don't envy those city folk who miss out on the joys of working the land.
At least Balgruuf's men bathed regularly. These Stormcloaks always smell of ale and sweat, and their breath reeks.
Between the war and the return of the dragons, I wonder if we should not leave Skyrim and ply our trade elsewhere.
But other than that, everything was business as usual. Now, do you have any other painfully obvious things to say?
But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric has made it clear. In his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with the Empire.
Comes with living to a ripe old age, people start thinking there's something magical about you. Then, the insults.
Do enjoy your time in Rorikstead. This close to the Reach, well, we are truly blessed to have such fertile ground.
Do they, my chief? Am I now favored enough to replace Shel by your side at the feast? Back your words with action!
Don't let Ulfric or some of these other short-sighted Nords bother you. Most of us are happy to welcome newcomers.
Don't listen to him. Ulfric's been telling lies about himself for so long, he's actually starting to believe them.
Don't worry, you can return to your petty squabbles and meaningless 'research' as soon as this matter is resolved.
Elisif has forbidden the Burning of King Olaf, a Festival put on by the Bards College. We need to change her mind.
Eorlund Gray-Mane was a stubborn fool. Our friendship ended when he turned his back on the Emperor. Now he's dead.
Even a fine weapon is only as good as its wielder, sir. But they should fetch a high price from the Imperial army.
Every now and then someone from the city comes by. Think they aren't used to seeing a Nord working for a Dark Elf.
Falkreath trades with the surrounding holds and without our wood they would have trouble keeping their prices low.
For another, I won't get mixed up with criminals and other sorts who take advantage of the honest folk for profit.
For your help, I'm sending word to the Orc strongholds that you're to be trusted. You should be welcome there now.
General, this is outrageous! You can't be taking this demand seriously! I thought we were here to discuss a truce!
Get to Dawnstar and see what you can find out about these rogues. I'd wager they won't be too far from the tavern.
Good work. Here's your cut. I guess this finishes up our contract with the Silver-Bloods, so we'll be heading out.
Good. I'll see if I can get some copies made for the men. Here, something for your trouble. The Legion thanks you.
Got a witchhunter in town, from the Priesthood of Stendarr. Keeps asking questions about that old abandoned house.
Got another personal score to settle and I'd consider it a favor if you'd take the job. Think you can help me out?
Ha ha ha ha! Yes, yes indeed! Hail the Imperial Legion! Hail the Stormcloaks! Hail Solitude and the Eight Divines!
Had we aided them in releasing the Skull, they would use it to wreak havoc across Skyrim. They... they had to die.
Hadvar! We've been so worried about you! Come, you two must be hungry. Sit down and I'll get you something to eat.
Have you seen that Shrine of Azura? They say the dark elves built it after they fled from Morrowind. Sight to see.
He has nothing but disdain for anyone who isn't a Nord. He tolerates us, but that's the extent of his hospitality.
He is quick to anger, and slow to forgive. One who wrongs Malacath is one who will endure great torment in return.
He is set to leave the Penitus Oculatus outpost at Dragon Bridge, and inspect the security of each city in Skyrim.
He says an Argonian's labor is only worth a tenth of a [QUOTE]proper Nord worker.[QUOTE] My people are not slaves!
He thinks we've been cursed. But we've been blessed. How can something that gives this kind of prowess be a curse?
Hear about the little Imperial boy, Aventus Aretino? The stupid whelp is trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood...
Her heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers.
Here's the payment for killing Alain. And nothing for letting Nilsine live. Just remember, that was your decision.
Here's your pay. It's never enough for what we do, but war gives us warriors its own kind of benefits, doesn't it?
Hey, shouldn't you tell the Temple of Mara that we're getting married? Be hard to have a wedding without a priest.
His heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers.
Hmph. Been awhile since I've actually cleaved someone in two. Forgot how hard it was to get the scimitar back out.
I am well aware. Tolfdir is still in Saarthal, is he? I shall be expecting a full report from him when he returns.
I am, Jarl. I wish to present King Olaf's verse from the Poetic Edda. Recovered this very day from the Bards Tomb.
I can appreciate that this... thing, this Orb... It's very impressive. Very unique, and definitely worth studying.
I can't tell if he expects me to blow myself up, or to try and murder him. But he clearly doesn't trust any of us.
I do hate to admit it, but if nothing else, all the fighting lately has been a complete blessing to this business.
I don't know how those cozy lords manage to drag themselves out of bed every day. Why bother if you're not living?
I don't know if you've heard, but Jarl Balgruuf said my work is a priority. Which means you should be on your way.
I guess you're right. A Nord shouldn't be so proud to turn down a kind soul's generosity. Tell Iddra I'll be fine.
I have a buyer looking for a case of Firebrand Wine. There just so happens to be a single case in the Blue Palace.
I just want to make clear that the only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace.
I knew he was troubled, but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me.
I leave all that sneaking around nonsense to everyone else; believe me, when I'm coming for you... you'll know it.
I may have entered into an... agreement with Enthir. He had something I needed, so I traded him something of mine.
I regret nothing of what we did at Driftshade. But I can't go any further with my mind fogged or my heart grieved.
I seem to recall Mirabelle mentioning the staff somewhat recently. Why don't you see if she can tell you anything?
I still have research that keeps me busy, and being here in Winterhold ensures I have access to former colleagues.
I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in  the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild.
I would like to personally thank you on behalf of myself and the Thalmor for your assistance. Here, for your work.
I would like you to take an item of his, a warhorn handed down from his father, and place it at a Shrine of Talos.
I... oh, all right. If there is a thief, he won't leave this tower alive. But shouldn't we inform Master Calcelmo?
I'll draft a letter to Rythe. If you could have it sent to Cheydinhal for me, that would make up for your blunder.
I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to cross blades with Vex again, but I certainly wouldn't mind a bit of a scuffle...
I'm fairly certain he was planning some sort of a heist that involved a deep understanding of the Falmer language.
I'm just not up for it, sorry. I'd rather stay here, have a glass of wine, and perform my rites to Arkay in peace.
I'm lucky enough that none of my friends have been killed. Of course we have soldiers coming through all the time.
I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or to declare his intentions.
I'm not out to win friends and I could care less if you're happy about your purchase or not. I just need the coin.
I'm sorry to break it to you, Giraud, but students are an unfortunate necessity of a college. Do try to persevere.
I'm Sybille Stentor, court mage of Solitude, and according to my scrying you've managed to unleash Potema herself!
I've finally found you! I want to join the College of Winterhold. But I need help with my wards. Can you teach me?
I've told the captain of the guard we'll have the meadery cleared for the tasting and he could be here any minute.
If a Stormcloak uses one of my swords to strike down an Imperial soldier, then I've done my part to free our land.
If he knew that I'd keep him from hunting the poor boy down, he'd take Fastred to Riften without a second thought.
If Maven Black-Briar keeps raising prices on mead, I'll have to resort to watering it down just to make ends meet.
If talking your way out of trouble isn't enough, you could always pick up some training from Delvin, Vex or Vipir.
If we could make contact with them, they could provide an excellent way to inconspicuously transport goods for us.
If we send half our guards to aid the legions, just for a few days, it could tip the scales in the Empire's favor.
If we were to... somehow... send a soul inside the Star. One that was ready to overpower Malyn from the inside....
In Black Marsh, tradition dictates we present a potential mate a unique wedding ring to represent our future bond.
In fact, I wouldn't say they were a threat at all. No, our resources should be spent on preparations for invasion.
In my time, the Blades protected the Emperor. It would seem these Penitus Oculatus will prove equally incompetent.
Ironically, the Night Mother could prove to be just as much a victim. The queen in a fool's twisted game of chess.
It didn't matter. The Imperial soldiers cut her down... killed her like a dog and left her body to rot in the mud.
It means waking up every day knowing that you could die, and having to earn your life by clawing for every breath.
It takes uncommon strength to work the mines in Skyrim. The earth here is cold and hard, like the heart of a Nord.
Just be yourself. Eliminate the targets any way you see fit. Quiet, loud, quick, slow - whatever you feel is best.
Just find a way in, get the information and leave. And you have permission to kill anyone that stands in your way.
Just north of Windhelm. There's a hollowed-out rock. I have some things hidden in there. Take them! They're yours.
Keening, and its counterpart, Sunder. Used by the tonal architects of the Dwemer to tap into the Heart of Lorkhan.
Korir will be the first to tell you that if it weren't for that College, we'd all be better off. I agree with him.
Laila is as clueless as she is stupid. No. If anything's to be done about this, we have to deal with it ourselves.
Learn a library's worth of knowledge in moments or grow back that missing limb with my genuine Falmerblood Elixir!
Let me guess. You'd rather play [QUOTE]Daedra and Battlemages[QUOTE] with Ordnar. Or go fishing, or catch frogs...
Like I said, I don't know! I've seen him down in the Ratway. Maybe he lives down there, but I don't know for sure.
Look. Something is happening here. I'm not sure entirely what that something is, but... Well, we need to find out.
Madesi was actually my original Saxhleel name. Unlike others, I decided to embrace tradition and keep it that way.
Magic is a true power, not something to be shunned by commoners or treated as an amusing diversion by politicians.
Mauhulakh. He wants to be a leader but spends too much time moping over women. Bolar and I should be all he needs.
Maven Black-Briar is the owner of the largest and most profitable business in all Skyrim, the Black-Briar Meadery.
My daughter Fjotli... she was murdered a few months ago. Left her laying on the ground in a pool of her own blood.
No doubt General Tullius and his friends in the Empire will tell you that I owe them my loyalty, and perhaps I do.
No more experiments are to be carried out there, and mages are advised that you enter the Midden at your own risk.
No one's seen them in well over a hundred years. They vanished, along with their sanctuary on the Isle of Artaeum.
No, I suppose we haven't. Brelyna Maryon, of House Telvanni. First of my family to leave Morrowind in a long time.
Now he refuses to even see me. He says I interrupt his vacation! It's been so many years... Won't you please help?
Now the time has come for a final proving. Are you able to cast aside your honor and strike with the hidden blade?
Occasionally I'll give you a contract with certain parameters. Stay within them, and you'll earn yourself a bonus.
Of course. Nothing gets done without my approval in this city. I have the Jarl's ear, and the guards in my pocket.
Oh, and if you can, hide his body. The longer it takes for anyone else to determine his real identity, the better.
Oh, I suppose. But you keep this to yourself; I don't want it being known that I go back on my trades. Understand?
Oh, pardon me. Were you saying something? I do apologize, it's just that I find myself suddenly and irrevocably...
Oh. Yes, of course you are right. Falk, tell Captain Aldis I said to assign a few extra soldiers to Dragon Bridge.
Once I'm in charge I have bigger aspirations than just Skyrim. I plan to bring Black-Briar Mead to all of Tamriel.
Only you can truly defeat these monsters, Dragonborn, but you do not have to do so alone. The Blades can help you.
Peryite, heed our call if you deem us worthy. Our leader, Orchendor, has led us here and for that we are thankful.
Pinemoon Cave is down to the southwest, but it ain't fit for exploring. There are stories... Vampires, some say...
Please tell him to leave me alone. Politely. I'm sure you'll have better luck getting through to him than I would.
Quite often, yes. The only thing I enjoy more than luxury is sharing that luxury with those who can appreciate it.
Really? Yes, maybe that would be just the thing. She seemed to be playing hard to get when I spoke to her earlier.
Remember when that used to be the Honningbrew Meadery? Didn't stand a chance against those Black-Briars of Riften.
Seek ye food or song unending? Fighting, drinking, fellowship and boasting? Find welcome here, and warm your soul.
She is a Daedra, a powerful being who watches from beyond our mortal plane. She has chosen you to be her champion.
So did I! If the damn Stormcloaks somehow found one, or woke it up... the war might be about to take an ugly turn.
So whenever we came across more than one deer in a single location, it was imperative we kill as many as we could.
So. You have made your way here, to me. No easy task for a joor... mortal. Even for one of Dovah Sos. Dragonblood.
Some like taking friends on adventures. M'aiq thinks being alone is better. Less arguing about splitting treasure.
Some say Ulfric desires to be king and nothing more... have they not seen that his anger floats on a sea of tears?
Sorry, my scaly friend, you've come to the wrong place. Around here we don't ignore what's happening in the world.
Tell Erik that I've changed my mind, and we'll visit Whiterun soon to fit him for armor. And please don't hurt me!
Thank you for your help with Vals. Please, take this and leave me to see to Aunt Agna and my other family members.
Thank you. I'm still at the beginning of my lessons. Dean Six Fingers used to say I was quite good with the flute.
Thank you. Now, since he banished me, Vile's been rather weak. He can't manifest very far from one of his shrines.
The amethyst in the center represents The Hist, the entity that all Argonians consider a sacred part of our lives.
The Blackblood Marauders have been plundering ships off the coast. A lot of people been hurt by their foolishness.
The coin isn't just for the men, there's a lot of people that need to be compensated in order to make this happen.
The college treasury is a bit thin right now. But I can show you some tricks I learned from my days with the army.
The moot will meet and choose Ulfric as High King. With his troops in most of the cities, they have little choice.
The research I've done seems to indicate that Skorm Snow-Strider left part of his journal here after laying siege.
The same could be said for any of us, could it not? Are you so guiltless as to stand in judgment upon Paarthurnax?
The soil beneath our feet is steeped in the blood of our ancestors. We've fought for this land and... died for it.
The Thalmor are paranoid and thorough. You won't get in the front door with anything but the clothes on your back.
The Thalmor will treat with whatever government rules Skyrim. We would not think of interfering in your civil war.
There's a war on and you don't know what I'm talking about? The Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for.
There's no question about that. It was a mighty deed. You've earned a place of honor among the heroes of Whiterun.
These fissures and cracks aren't encouraging. Malyn obviously was growing more desparate once he left the College.
They are popular with the nobility there, yes. This particular bracelet is a copy of one worn by a Crown Princess.
Thirty years ago, they invaded the Empire and came close to destroying it. They smashed the Blades in the process.
Those of us who were faithful to Azura were given a vision that led us away from the island before the worst came.
Torygg was merely a message to the other Jarls. Whoever we replace them with will need the support of our armies. 
Turning him in to the guards? Have you joined Mjoll as official peacekeepers of Riften? You cost me a lot of coin.
Ulfric, you can't be taking this demand seriously? We can hold Riften against anything the Empire can throw at it.
Use the gloves to clear the focal points. Return to me when you have finished. I thought I made this rather clear.
We also have the opportunity to slay an Imperial Legate. That'll put fear and confusion into those faithless dogs.
We are the messengers of death, you and I. Together, we will unleash the unholy wrath of our Dread Father, Sithis.
Welcome, people of Solitude! We of the Bards College are pleased to be here to celebrate the Burning of King Olaf.
Well he don't like company, I can tell you that much. Just wants to be left alone. But no... that's not really it.
Well, I need someone I can practice a few spells on. Nothing dangerous, really. Would you be willing to assist me?
Well, I suppose it's time, isn't it? Let's see what happens. You, uhh... You may want to stand back a step or two.
Well, I've heard awful stories about these Thalmor, and how they're rounding up everyone who still worships Talos.
Well, you see, that's a little complicated, and... you know what? Never mind. Guess I'm not retiring anytime soon.
What could it mean? The return of the Dragonborn? And who among us could possibly hold that honor? And such power?
When the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Imperial City, the Legion all but turned a blind eye to the other provinces.
When Ulfric Stormcloak, with savage Shout, sent me here, my sole regret was fair Elisif, left forlorn and weeping.
Why of course. And will you also be needing the bow that shoots rainbows? Or perhaps a quiver that dispenses beer?
Yes, Lady Mjoll. If Riften gets attacked, we'll retreat inside the city gates and bar the door just like you said.
Yes, well. Perhaps the proprietor of this establishment can assist you. Please, you're starting to... frighten me.
Yes. Alduin... zeymah. The elder brother. Gifted, grasping and troublesome as is so often the case with firstborn.
You can't attack my family and get away with it, fetcher! I will have an apology, or your head on a spike. Choose.
You know, maybe I was wrong about you after all. Anyone who's smart enough to shut up and listen can't be all bad.
You look like you've seen your share of adventure. I envy you that. In fact, maybe you can help me with something.
You mean Hildolf the Skull-Splitter? Remember when we rounded up the townspeople and dragged him out of that cave?
You sure about that? Then please, be my guest and go strolling on in there. We'll stay here and watch your back...
You're disgusting! Don't you even think of laying a finger on me or I'll cut off something you can't live without.
You're forgiven. Now, I want to know if you've made any progress with my son. Is he cursed? Has he been possessed?
You're telling me. Playing nursemaid to a bunch of bees and drinking mead all day beats dying on some battlefield.
You've come a long way. I don't think we could do without you. I'm hereby raising you to Tribune. Congratulations.
You've done a fine thing for me. You know, I used to be quite a warrior in my day. Let me show you a thing or two.
You've proven reliable. There's a group of bandits in my Hold that I... may have had a few discreet dealings with.
You've shown yourself useful so far. All these lunks are too afraid of Haldyn to head in before the fog's cleared.
Your free will is an illusion. Whether you acknowledge me or not is your own business. But I will be in your mind.
...Cicero never understood thieves, really... take someone's things before you kill them? And they call me crazy...
A joke? Alain Dufont... a joke? I am a king on my throne, and you, my friend... you will die slowly, and painfully.
A little boy who lived here. Aventus Aretino. He was nice, but really quiet, and sad, because his mother just died.
A living Dwemer was once discovered in Morrowind. Can you imagine it, being the last surviving member of your race?
Ah, don't let my words cut you too deep. I've just been working the forge too hard. Trying to set this sword right.
Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Wait... I remember you. So the old man thinks you've got some heart, I guess.
Ah, killing her will be easy. She'll be so happy, she'll never see it coming. I should know, I killed a bride once.
Ain't many visitors come to the dungeon. Every now and then Sybille Stentor will come by looking for... volunteers.
All I know is that Idolaf made some effort to find out what happened to him, but was told to stop asking questions.
Although this gift has often been misused, the only true use of the Voice is for the worship and glory of the gods.
And one more thing. Have fun. You'll be committing a dark deed, but there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy yourself.
And so, we must each one of us, continue to fight this insurrection, lest our fallen brothers have died for naught!
As I said, it's easy to find things nobody will miss. My sister Deeja and I are treasure hunters. You could be too.
As you may be aware, the College has gone to great lengths to purify and enhance the natural energies of the world.
Banning the worship of Talos was the last straw. Thalmor everywhere, dragging people off for honoring our own gods!
Besides, I also prefer the quiet. I didn't open this business for browsing. Come in, buy what you need and get out.
Brynjolf, the time has come to decide Mercer's fate. Until a new Guild Master is chosen, the decision falls to you.
But I am not the Listener. Oh no. You are the Listener! You heard the words! And everything will soon be put right.
But if not... if they actually mean something, they might tell me where I'm from... what ship was I on. Everything.
But listen, I think I can help you. The wedding reception is outside the Temple of the Divines, right? In Solitude?
But more to the point. Do you - tiny, puny, expendable little mortal - actually think you can convince me to leave?
But not all can enter there. Only Septimus knows the hidden key to loose the lock to jump beneath the deathly rock.
But the political situation is still delicate. Not all the Jarls are fully committed to supporting me as High King.
By taking back Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. We should never have given it up.
Come back when you're committed to the cause, or go join the Legion. They're taking anyone with a pulse these days.
Could you deliver the ashes to Runil, the priest of Arkay? He'll know the right blessings to make for Berit's soul.
Could you have brought us more wondrous news? Recent events notwithstanding, this is a happy day for us, my friend.
Did I hear correctly, Thonar? Is your brother really asking you to settle another dispute between Mulush and Nepos?
Did you get a look at that thief that they sent to break into the place? What I wouldn't give for a night with her.
Dovahkiin. You have tasted the Voice of the Greybeards, and passed through unscathed. High Hrothgar is open to you.
Either way, it's been a pleasure, my friend. Here's to the future of the Guild. May it last another thousand years!
Falion said he hated what this place was becoming. So he just left. Aren found a note on his desk, and that was it.
Falkreath's reputation has faded somewhat, but the graves remain, reminding us of the one inevitable truth of life.
First off, they've got some rebels holed up in a nearby settlement. Need to clean them out so our boys can move in.
For it will be Skyrim that shall lead Tamriel in those dark days, when the fate of the world is finally determined.
From that point forward, every time Vivienne and I were anywhere close to each other, he made sure to humiliate me.
Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.
Giants are a common problem in the Pale. The Empire always demanded I leave them be, but the Empire isn't here now.
Go to Markarth. There you'll find Calcelmo, wise, acid, and reclusive. Help him to emerge and state his intentions.
Got a client in desperate need for this item. He won't say what it's for, and we don't care. Can you take this one?
Haha. I knew it! No woman yet born has been able to resist my charms for long. Thank you, my friend. I owe you one.
He could be this Esbern you're looking for, but I don't know. He's old and seemed kind of crazy. That's all I know.
He could have anything in there. War contraband. Weapons. Skooma. Ain't no way I'm getting involved in any of that.
He used the Thu'um. Shouted those Forsworn from the walls. Then he led a band of Nord warriors in to take the city.
He'd beat me up, dump mead on my head, anything he could get away with. Once he even slipped a beehive into my bed.
Here, take the Goldenglow Estate Deed as proof. And when you speak to Mercer, tell him I'm worth more to him alive.
Here. Give this letter to Camilla and tell her it's from Sven. Let's see what she thinks of him after reading that.
I am a lethal instrument, yours to command for a modest sum. I suggest you hire me before one of your enemies does.
I am grateful to have the life that I do now. It is a far cry from my days as an orphan on the streets of Corinthe.
I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the man we know as Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn.
I attempted to build my own, based on designs and using parts you helped to provide. My very own Dwarven Convector.
I don't buy all that talk about ship captains having to be stern and strict. I want my crewmen to enjoy their work.
I don't know really.  The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.
I don't know what your made of, but I've never seen anyone tackle this many jobs without endin' up dead or in jail.
I don't know... I don't want to do anything that might offend Elenwen. There is a lot of money at stake, after all.
I don't understand, Elgrim. The formulas you're giving me are for novices but I've advanced well passed that point.
I fight with both blade and spell. You might say I'm equipped to handle nearly any threat. So, shall we talk price?
I find the concept of sleeping with you not only repulsive, but morally unsettling. Does that answer your question?
I fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion. I bled and spilt blood for the Empire. And for what?
I had Kaie recover all the things the Nords stole from you. You better get ready before we break out into the city.
I had to for honor's sake, but I had waited too long. My father died before he could see my training to completion.
I hope in his next life, he's reborn as an Argonian forced to live in a slum because of some bigoted Nord dictator.
I knew the Greybeards would send you there if they thought you were Dragonborn. They're nothing if not predictable.
I need you to create some chaos in the hold so I can maneuver men into position without drawing too much attention.
I remember you... You were at Helgen with us! Come to join the war? Speak with Galmar. He handles the new recruits.
I should not have agreed to host this council. The Greybeards have no business involving ourselves in such matters.
I swear Elenwen holds these parties just to make the Empire look bad. Almost makes me want to join the Stormcloaks.
I think I heard someone mention it was underneath the Temple of Dibella, in the big crag in the center of the city.
I think some of them do, Lady Mjoll. They're just too frightened to step up and do something about it like you are.
I thought it was strange that Aringoth stopped coming into town. I suppose he's having some difficulties out there.
I used to work at the Black-Briar Meadery, but Indaryn and I never saw eye-to-eye. That elf has no patience at all.
I waited and waited, and he never came back. Probably shacked up with some elven whore. Good riddance to him I say.
I will tend Azura's shrine when you do not need me. I still have my duties, but for the first time I feel... alone.
I worry about the other settlements in the hold. Unwalled, lightly manned - prime targets for those damned dragons.
I'll allow you the opportunity to turn around, walk out that door, and never come back. I suggest you move quickly.
I'll point you to the first and last person you're ever going to need to talk to. Tonilia. She's the Guild's fence.
I'll search through Sinderion's notes and find some more information about the Crimson Nirnroot and its properties.
I'll take your challenge, but if I win I get to start a new life as an adventurer, and with no objections from you.
I'll talk to him, but he's stubborn. He's like his mother; he sees what he wants and he won't quit until he has it.
I'm goin' to tell you'll somethin' you'll never hear me say again, and if you tell anyone I told you, I'll deny it.
I've got a shipment of Spices the East Empire Company is holding up. I need someone to convince them to release it.
I've made a few of the Gourmet's dishes myself, actually. His roast mutton with Redguard berry sauce is to die for.
I've never felt it appropriate to ask him about it, about how that must feel. Or, I suppose, if he can feel at all.
If it can help us get inside the College, and reach Ancano, we'll have to hope that there's a way to stop all this.
If she isn't convinced of the festival's importance then she won't reverse her decision to stop the effigy burning.
If that must be, then it will. And why should I be any different? How many the lives already lost. What's one more?
If there's someone in the palace who can speak for you and wouldn't mind walking you around. Great. Lead me to him.
If you think that winning a few battles means you're winning the war, you're even worse at strategy than diplomacy.
If you're headed that way, I would appreciate you delivering a purchase agreement for me. You'd be paid, of course.
Incorrect. You can worship whatever gods you like. But Talos is a man, and only a heretic would think otherwise... 
It cannot become widely known that these sorts of things happen here. Work will need to be done to keep this quiet.
It's not going to be next year, nor the year after that! You just care about this farm more than you care about me!
It's time to face the truth, old friend. You, Vex, Mercer... you're all part of a dying breed. Things are changing!
Lady Mjoll, if you lost a gold ring anywhere in this city I'm afraid it's likely never to be seen again. I'm sorry.
Look. If you're trying to get to know me - don't. I don't like you, and I never will. It's nothing personal. But...
Mallus is the best deal I've ever made. Lent him a bit of gold some time ago I knew he'd never be able to pay back.
My father was all the family I ever had. I felt so lost when he died. But the crew of the Red Wave's my family now.
My heart goes out to Clan Shatter-Shield. Kin murdered, family warhammer stolen... There's no fairness in all that.
No. It's too late for the wardstone. Vighar must be destroyed. If this gets out, my family will suffer great shame.
Not actually a Companion myself, but none of them know how to work a forge properly, and I'm honored to serve them.
Not really. It's just a bunch of elders standing around, looking important. I wish something exciting would happen.
Now that you've transacted the Oath, it's time to reveal the final piece of the puzzle to you; Mercer's true crime.
Okay, got just the one for you. Ledger's just beggin' to be changed and the Guild could use the coin. How about it?
Only those whose Voice is strong can find the path. Come. We will teach you a Shout to open the way to Paarthurnax.
Oooh... So silent. So menacing. A true assassin of the old way. Cicero likes you. Oh yes, Cicero likes you, indeed.
Otherwise, I am uncertain what will end your Dreamstride. Perhaps when Vaermina's curious appetite has been filled.
Over a year ago, thieves broke into the college and made off with a lot of valuable things. Mostly gold and silver.
Perhaps the hofkahsejun - the palace in Whiterun... Dragonsreach. It was originally built to house a captive dovah.
Perhaps this world is simply the Egg of the next kalpa? Lein vokiin? Would you stop the next world from being born?
Playing tonight, Ogmund? Everyone here is anxious to hear the old ballads performed by the True Skald of the Reach.
Preposterous! That research represents years of personal toil in some of the most dangerous Dwemer ruins in Skyrim!
Ri'saad was able to look past that, and it was he who helped to set me up with a trade caravan. Now I work for him.
Shall we loose his bonds and put you in a cell together? You can ask him anything you like, and see how he answers.
She came through a while ago, wanted to know where she could get her hands on something valuable. Anything, really.
So I ran away, and came home. And performed the Black Sacrament. Now you're here! And you can kill Grelod the Kind!
So many undesirables to contend with. Naysayers. Buffoons. Detractors. Why, my headsman hasn't slept in three days!
So we fought them in the shadows, all across Tamriel. We thought we were more than a match for them. We were wrong.
So, unless you wish a visit from one of their own, I'd suggest you follow your own advice and keep your mouth shut.
So, you've done it. The men of violence are gathered here, in these halls whose very stones are dedicated to peace.
Stand between us, and prepare yourself. Few can withstand the unbridled Voice of the Greybeards. But you are ready.
Such a shame. I thought we were getting along so well. I'll head back to Riften if you should have second thoughts.
Tell him I'll pay double the normal price. We've been getting by with one broken pitchfork, but it's falling apart.
Thanks again for helping reopen the East Empire Company. Gonna have them import me some of that aged Breton cheese.
That's all I ask. With your help, we have a chance to make a better life for ourselves here. For that, I thank you.
That's not what my scouts report, sir. Every day more join his cause. Riften, Dawnstar, and Winterhold support him.
That's the real question, isn't it? No one can deny Elisif has a legitimate claim to become High Queen of Skyrim...
That's why the Ebonmere needed to be reopened. Without it, there's no way Nocturnal was able to allow them through.
The conduit to Nocturnal's realm, the realm of Evergloam, has been in Skyrim... well, longer than recorded history.
The Dark Elves and the Wood Elves have never been the best of friends. Be patient, they'll come around soon enough!
The Dark Mistress? Sent you? Ha. Now tell me the one about the Troll who gives gifts to good little boys and girls.
The edged lexicon, for inscribing. To us, a hunk of metal. To the Dwemer, a full library of knowings. But... empty.
The Empire's always taken us for granted. Nords died by the thousands in the Great War, and what did the Empire do?
The Guild was thrown into disarray. Several stepped up and tried to claim Gallus's former position as Guild Master.
The hags are hateful of anything which grows from the earth. They made the weapon strong against the natural world.
The head office will hear of this, Razelan! You're a disgrace to the East Empire Company, and to the Empire itself!
The real irony is that, while General Tullius is certainly no Nord, the people of Skyrim would be lost without him.
Then I thank you for showing me mercy. Here, take this coin to him. If it keeps us together, it's worth its weight.
Then let's increase the taxes on the farms and merchants. We can't afford to lose the loyalty of the ship captains.
There are scholars in Cyrodiil who have dedicated their lives to solving the mystery of the Dwemers' disappearance.
There's been talk amongst the guards. That you are... Dragonborn. But such a thing... Surely that's not possible...
These are the most dangerous, but the most profitable types of ruins. The dwarves must have been a prosperous race.
These marks keep their ledger all neat and tidy, but they're ripe for some change if you know what I mean. Take it?
They say a strong drink, a sharp axe and a good woman are all a Nord needs to be happy. Two out of three's not bad.
This both enhances our connection to the realm of magic, and eliminates possible interference from outside sources.
This is an exciting opportunity for us. To be able to study such an early civilization, and the magics they used...
This is the Temple of Kynareth. The Gildergreen, outside, was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun.
Those who've been under the effect of it for extended periods of time have been known to lose their minds entirely.
Through fire and time, the terror has lived. No more, I say! I've set my heart on terrible deeds, death's grim art.
Uf. Have you been talking to Viola Giordano? She posts those all over the city, and someone keeps taking them down.
Ulfric showed his true colors today, eh? Don't worry. You aren't the first to be taken in by his self-serving lies.
Versatility is the key to survival. Hire me, and you'll be well -prepared to face threats both magical and mundane.
We can do this one of two ways. You can walk with me up to the keep, or I can drag your lifeless body. Your choice.
We gather here today, under Mara's loving gaze, to bear witness to the union of two souls in eternal companionship.
We Gray-Manes got just as much to be proud of as them Battle-Borns, but you won't see us with our noses in the air.
We're stretched thin as it is with the war. Nobody has the time to spend on this. Not pleasant, but it's the truth.
We've gone from a Jarl lost in her own head to a Jarl that cares for nothing but herself. Lot of good that does us.
Welcome. Look around. We've got everything you could want in life. At least... that's what Beirand always tells me.
Well, I was thinking maybe something mournful. A High Elf dirge, perhaps? These are rather trying times, after all.
Well. I can see your father and I are going to have to talk about this. And when we do, things are going to change.
Well... okay. My father owns the Winking Skeever. But it's the family business, so it'll be mine when he kicks off.
Well... there is guy like that. He's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here, but I guess I can tell you.
When I was a young rascal, I broke a man's arm with a single punch. Course, I had a horseshoe hidden in my glove...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. It's all right. You've been through a lot. Maybe you should just sit down for a bit...
Why in goodness name would you have... oh never mind, just bring them by my house later and I'll see what I can do.
Would you be so kind as to deliver the frost salts for me? I'm sure Arcadia will provide some form of recompense...
Yeah. Calcelmo called in his entire expedition team- said he needed every man he could get to protect his research.
Yes, but he offered it as an idea. Perhaps he hopes it will be helpful, but does not wish to risk personal failure.
Yes, I know. As does Astrid. And you've earned your payment, though the bonus is forfeit, as I'm sure you're aware.
Yes, um.... So it would seem. Well, I won't waste your time. I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually.
Yes. Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the Guild's treasury without anyone's knowledge.
Yes. It's an altar. Men would come and sacrifice the wretched in my name. The weak would be punished by the strong.
You have gathered here night after night, sacrificing fools upon my shrine, and sparring aimlessly with yourselves.
You looking for work? Got a sailor who thought running a gang of thieves would be more money than hauling my cargo.
You may have everyone else impressed around here, but you don't impress me. You couldn't touch me if you wanted to.
You there, Unblooded, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting.
You want Garvey. He handles the keys for the Warrens. About the only thing that disease-riddled native is good for.
You'd better. Because until you do, you don't get a single coin from us... and you won't be able to use our fences.
You'll be going back to the College, then? I, uhh... I think perhaps I'll wait a bit before venturing there myself.
You'll have plenty of time to take it up with the King in Rags while you're serving a life sentence in Cidhna Mine.
You've done the Guild a great deed. And although they may not show it, I'm certain they appreciate your sacrifices.
You've finally become one of us. Come with me. I think it's time I announced my plans to you and your new brothers.
You've more than proven that the Thieves Guild is back on its feet in our city and earned every bit of your reward.
[QUOTE]In Solitude bards train for their service, they also gather each year and burn a King who deserves it.[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]Mmmhmm[QUOTE]? I've been working with you for over 10 years, and all you have to say is [QUOTE]mmmhmm[QUOTE]?
Agreed. He's taken everything the Guild has left, and to go after one of the last greatest heists is just an insult.
Ah, now this is a sad path. Pelagius hated and feared many things. Assassins, wild dogs, the undead, pumpernickel...
Ah, that must be it. So many of the men are serving in battle. I shall pray to Stendarr that they return victorious.
Ah, yet another new face. I'm from Hammerfell, you see. I can hardly keep track of all the people I've been meeting.
And after they made me watch as her head rolled off the block, they threw me in here anyway, to dig up their silver.
And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand boy?
Any aspiring mage would do well to look for the College in Winterhold. Head there, and you'll get what you're after.
Arch-Mage Aren believed that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur.
Arch-Mage Aren believes that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur.
Arch-Mage, the Synod have contacted us again, asking if we've any word on their researchers. What shall I tell them?
Aringoth said as soon as the deed goes through, we're done here. Then we'll head south and look for more work. Deal?
As a matter of fact, I do. Two of them. One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge.
Avulstein Gray-Mane and I were best friends as children. If I see that traitor again, I'll throw him in jail myself!
Azura. Who led her children away from the disaster of Vvardenfell. You are the prophet that reveals our true future.
Battle-Born is a name out of legend, sung in the songs of old and heard in deeds of valor for a hundred generations.
Because my king told me to. Madanach. When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines.
Being connected to a criminal didn't make the client happy... next time, act like a real thief and don't get caught.
Between the cliff and Snapleg Cave there, I hate this stretch of road. There's an evil air up here. Getalong, horse.
But don't underestimate the Stormcloaks. Many are Legion veterans. They may be traitors, but they know how to fight.
But enough of that... I'm confident that with you in charge, we'll soon have more gold than we could possibly spend.
But his soul still resides within, protected by his enchantments. Until he is purged, my artifact is useless to you.
But I don't understand. Why let a dragon into the heart of my city when we've been working so hard to keep them out?
But I think the forge knows the greatness of Kodlak's soul. I can't really explain, but it feels like it's... young.
But, as you say, these negotiations may offer a chance for his supporters to gracefully return to the Imperial fold.
But, if you find more trouble than you can handle, run out to the courtyard. We'll come as soon as we hear fighting.
Can't say I was a great father the first time around. Now that he's here it's like a second chance. He's a good lad.
Change Arn's entry in the book to anything you want and they'll be forced to let him go after he serves a few weeks.
Come, let us share a cup of mead, and trade tales of our time on Mundus, reliving the glory of our remembered deeds.
Dagur never heard any of this, and I chose to keep it to myself. I'm only telling you so you don't get into trouble.
Dishonorable dog. You attacked one of my kin. So now you're going to apologize... or I'm going to lop off your head.
Do not presume, Gissur. You are most useful, but do not presume. We have other informants who are less... offensive.
Don't fret over the gloom, there's nothing to fear! Old Lurbuk will brighten your spirits -- just lend him your ear!
Ever seen a book called [QUOTE]The Mirror[QUOTE]? We used to hand it out to boys looking to learn basic shield work.
Figures the Thalmor would be on his trail, though, if they were trying to find out what's going on with the dragons.
First you'll need to retrieve the dagger, then use it to carve a few scales off a dragon. Presumably a deceased one.
Following the Great War, the White-Gold Concordat set out the terms for peaceful coexistence between the two powers.
Forgive me. I was... intemperate. I allowed my emotions to cloud my judgment. Master Einarth reminded me of my duty.
Got a tip on a desirable item at this location. We want you to break in there and bring it to us. What do you think?
Greetings, mortal. You have followed my guidance through the veils of Twilight and rescued my Star from Malyn Varen.
He was quite clear that he felt more in his element climbing through a window rather than hunched over a dusty tome.
He's a rogue mage who defected at the beginning of the war.  I turned him in but apparently he escaped and now this.
He's busy forgetting that Ulfric Stormcloak saved this city from the Forsworn. Ulfric's a hero, not a damn criminal.
He's Solitude's priest of Arkay. He's the one who figured out Potema was still around. He'll help as much as he can.
Here's all you need to know. Jorrvaskr is the oldest building in Whiterun. The Skyforge was here long before it was.
His doom was written when he claimed for himself the lordship that properly belongs to Bormahu - our father Akatosh.
I abide only those whose will is aligned to my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.
I am sorry I cannot provide you with further help, but this conversation requires a great deal of effort on my part.
I can commission one from the Radiant Raiment. It won't be cheap, but if you want the best, they're the only choice.
I cannot thank you enough for rescuing me from this place. I suspect I'd never again see the light of day otherwise.
I don't know, you don't look so impressive to me. I mean, you're no Gray Fox, but you must be doing something right.
I don't know. Rumor has it that she was murdered... butchered by a madman. I really try and stay out of such things.
I don't like the look of this. Perfect spot for an ambush. Ten to one they're just waiting for us on the other side.
I don't suppose they want the world to end any more than we do. Or at least, they'd prefer to end it on their terms.
I know there are some who have blamed the College, said that we were responsible. I assure you this is not the case.
I managed to pick the lock and slip out while the guard slept, but now I'm completely lost. Can you help me, please?
I met several of your kind during my studies of life-extending magics. I even  considered becoming a vampire myself.
I need you to root them out and drive them away before they find me and drag me back to Hammerfell for an execution.
I think I have a few old spell books laying about. If you want more, you'll have to go to the College of Winterhold.
I think that's just their way. The Nords don't like anybody who's not a Nord, but they're not bad people, deep down.
I think you may have joined up with the wrong side, Dragonborn. You showed yourself a true son of Skyrim here today.
I told you I'm not hiring any more guards. Why do you people always bother me when I'm trying to finish my research?
I warn you, it's dangerous work. No man of mine has ever faced a Hagraven and lived. I'll understand if you decline.
I was just outside Ivarstead when it happened. It's an exciting moment. Nothing like this has happened in centuries.
I was trained by some of the finest warriors in all Skyrim to wield a blade as if it was an extension of my own arm.
I'll anoint you with the symbol of the Bear, the Sabrecat and the Mammoth. Tread carefully, these are mighty beasts.
I'll soon arrange transportation for our little friend. Don't worry, he'll rot in a cell and pay for what he's done.
I'm glad you were able to negotiate a truce, but I don't trust Ulfric. He'll break his word as soon as it suits him.
I'm going to put this back where it belongs. I'll never forget this. You've done a great thing for me and my sister.
I'm not sure what it's made from, but I can tell you that once you've had a taste, you'll never crave anything else.
I'm sure that will be comforting to your comrades that gave their lives for the territory you just handed to Ulfric.
I've been to the monastery many times, but I've never even laid eyes on one of the Greybeards. Not that I'd care to.
I've only looked through a portion of this section. You, uh, you can look around in the chambers just north of here.
If it's malachite you're after, you've come to the right place. I'll pay for any you dig up out of Steamscorch Mine.
If you come across anything in your travels that might provide me with the answers I'm looking for, I'd be grateful.
If you find Staubin, it would be good to see any notes he may have collected. I doubt you'll find him alive, though.
If you really are Ralof's friend, I'll be glad to help you. But you didn't answer my question - how do you know him?
If you wish to wear your Nightingale Armor within the Guild, I'm certain that no one would give it a second thought.
In the meantime, I wanted you to have this. It belonged to Gallus, but given the circumstances I think he'd approve.
It usually given by the head priest who sanctified the ritual. In my case, the head priest happened to be my father.
It was brave of you to come to me with this. I can't thank you for it, not for this, but you have done me a service.
It would be kept under the highest security. The greatest thief in the world wouldn't be able to lay a finger on it.
It's difficult to appreciate her gifts in these dark times, but you should consider her light a beacon in the storm.
It's nice to shake the cobwebs off and get things rollin' again. Keep this up and I can see a bounty headed our way.
It's no feast in their neck of the woods either. Last time I was up there, father said they were barely scraping by.
It's part of the Temple of Kynareth. People want Danica to do something about it, but I don't know what they expect.
It's quite simple really. There are some who shall not be dignified by being named, who have implied that it is not.
J'zargo has heard of the Staff of Magnus. Once you are done with it, perhaps you will allow J'zargo to... Borrow it?
Just stop trying to change me, mother! I'm not a baby anymore! I'm almost a woman! I... I can't be who I want to be!
Karliah destroyed everything this Guild stood for. She murdered my predecessor in cold blood and betrayed the Guild.
Knowledge of truly powerful Illusion spells is here at the College, but it is hidden from those who might misuse it.
Logrolf rescued me and gave me enough money to get out of the city. I followed the Karth river north, and came here.
Malacath teaches us to honor all words with action. To demand blood from your enemies and strength from your allies.
Maybe this is my chance to make things right. I can finish Malyn's work, the way we had meant to before his madness.
My brothers, we have been here long enough. It's time to leave Cidhna Mine and continue our fight against the Nords.
My daughter was sent to the orphanage there when I stood accused of illegal necromancy. I had no choice. Run or die.
My mother, she... she died. I... I'm all alone now. So they sent me to that terrible orphanage in Riften. Honorhall.
My time saw the assassination of an Emperor as well. Alas, the Dark Brotherhood did not have the honor of that kill.
Naal Thu'umu, mu ofan nii nu, Dovahkiin, naal suleyk do Kaan, naal suleyk do Shor, ahrk naal suleyk do Atmorasewuth.
No. They ain't. And they aren't gonna. If you weren't payin' for your room, I'd have thrown you out a long time ago.
Not much, I'm afraid. It was named Kahvozein's Fang after the dragon worshipped by this particular sect of the cult.
Now go. I have strings to pull that require my full attention. You may pursue your own course wherever it leads you.
Now that the Empire's arrived in Riften, we've finally established a launching point into Morrowind... just in case.
Now wait a minute... No need to do anything drastic. Look, Keep the horse, all right? Then we all walk away happy...
Now, then, boy. What's the big mystery? What are you doing here, looking like you lost an argument with a cave bear?
Of course there's a collapse in trade, Raerek. The Stormcloaks stalk every road and harass every one of our patrols.
Of course. Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
Often times you won't be able to get as close to your prey as you'd like and you'll have to settle with a long shot.
Oh, did you miss the ceremony? It was rather quick, actually. The couple seemed more concerned with their reception.
Oh, of course you want me to leave. Just waiting for me to turn my back. So you can have all the glory for yourself!
Oh? What is this, some kind of herb? Are you sure? The Potage tastes perfect as it is. Any other ingredient might...
One day, these beautiful plants will make us famous and we can finally move off of this farm... thanks to Sinderion.
One of the quickest ways to make some coin in Skyrim is to clear out some of the wealthier homes of their valuables.
Only way you could have found one of those is by stealin' it. Guess you'll fit in around here better than I thought.
Other people just make things complex. Out here, Hern and I can get everything we need from the occasional traveler.
Perhaps if I had been more vigilant, then Mercer Frey wouldn't have lured me to my fate and stolen the Skeleton Key.
Please don't tell me that another one of the apprentices has been incinerated. I have enough to deal with right now.
Problem is, that place is locked up tighter than a miser's purse. They could teach me a few things about paranoia...
Proudspire Manor, now there's a fine home. Up for sale, too. If you're interested, talk to the steward, in the keep.
Remember always this: You need answer to no authority, neither mortal, nor divine... As you will it, so it shall be.
Returning to High Rock. Our shepherd lost his way, and I fear Peryite's wrath may consume those who remain with him.
Sacked by the elves in the infamous [QUOTE]Night of Tears,[QUOTE] not much is known about what happened to Saarthal.
Shor's hall, shimmering across the clouded vale. But quenched was hope by the shrouding mist - my mind is darkened. 
So, are you working with them? You think you can take me? You so much as touch me, and you're going to lose fingers.
Some say that when Vvardenfell erupted, a piece was blown to the middle of Skyrim and from the crater grew the tree.
Someone's been pilfering crops from my farm. If I find out it's one of your kin, I'll see the culprit rot in prison.
Still... everyone assumes the Dark Brotherhood has been completely destroyed. They may be a bit more lax than usual.
Surely you're aware of the Great War between the Imperials and the Elves who called themselves the Aldmeri Dominion?
Take for example, Ulfric Stormcloak and his little [QUOTE]rebellion.[QUOTE] But rest assured, his days are numbered.
Thank you, thank you! I promise I'll help. And then I'll go back to the College and I'll beg them to let me back in.
Thanks to your efforts, the Guild's been restored to it's full strength and you've exposed the traitor in our midst.
The Code of Malacath. It is both tradition and law in the strongholds. Break the code, and you must pay Blood Price.
The Companions are nearly five thousand years old. This matter of beastblood has only troubled us for a few hundred.
The Cruel-Seas have been sailors for generations. In truth, I regret not following in the footsteps of my ancestors.
The local Nords may not like us very much, but they don't seem to mind having access to enchanted weapons and armor.
The new guards are often too busy learning their responsibilities to notice a few smuggled goods or minor robberies.
The old traditions are passed down from one generation to the next. The secrets of smithing are passed down as well.
The only difference is she doesn't demand payment in the traditional sense and sometimes the cost can be quite high.
The people of Morthal would much rather weave their own horrid tales about my life than simply ask me for the truth.
The Skull has been out of touch for so long, I fear it's gained the ability to reach out on its own and try to feed.
The Stormcloaks are content to live in the past forever. No wonder the Provincials think we're all baseless savages.
The Twilight Sepulcher is the temple to Nocturnal. It's what the Nightingales are sworn to protect with their lives.
The verse criticized the reigning King Olaf. He was so incensed the bard was put to death and all the copies burned.
Their whole lives were consumed with hatred for dragons, and they poured all their anger and hatred into this Shout.
There is no way I can pay you what this Lute is worth. But I can teach you a few tricks I've learned over the years.
There is one final aspect we wish for you to explore. For a strong love can withstand storms and even survive death.
There's more enchanting to be done. You can acquire whatever it is and bring it back here, and I'll take care of it.
These secret visits to the tavern will make you an easy target for an enemy assassin. You should have told me first.
They knew Thorald supported the Stormcloaks, knew he was going to aid them in battle. Made sure he didn't come back.
They're the rulers of the Aldmeri Dominion - what used to be the Imperial provinces of Summerset Isle and Valenwood.
Though I confess, being surrounded by so many wealthy and important people makes me feel more than a little nervous.
To kill the Emperor of Tamriel... The Dark Brotherhood hasn't done such a thing since the assassination of Pelagius.
Ulfric's not running a social club. You don't join anything. Either you're a true daughter of Skyrim, or you're not.
Used to run with a bandit clan in The Pale. Turns out I didn't like them and they didn't like me, so we parted ways.
Watch your step, Markarth has quite a reputation thanks to the Silver-Blood family. I wouldn't advise crossing them.
We have no interest in negotiating with the Empire. It's only a matter of time before they are driven out of Skyrim.
We know what path you've set him on. But he has made a different choice. Paarthurnax is still safe from your malice.
We may not have as much to offer as Whiterun or Solitude, but we'll do what we can to make your stay a pleasant one.
We were able to figure out the last text you brought in. I thought the least I could do is pass the knowledge along.
We're not just fighting Imperials. We're fighting to restore Skyrim to her glory and give her the king she deserves.
We've made peace with one another without even uttering a single word and I'm content for the first time in my life.
Welcome to the House of Curiosities! I offer a brief tour for a few coins, or you can simply browse at your leisure.
Well, at the first sign of battle I'll be comfortably sitting in my room, waiting for it to end, so don't you worry.
Well, I do recall warning them it might not be the safest of locations. I hope this doesn't become a problem for us.
Well, Sabjorn. Now that you've taken care of your little pest problem, how about I get a taste of some of your mead?
Well. Good! You favor the Empire less than I feared. Maybe we will be able to come to some agreement here after all.
What could be more important than hearing the prayers of the faithful, and answering the questions of the dedicated?
What's become of us? We used to be inseparable... always fighting back to back and letting nothing stand in our way.
When it was clear we were going to have to fall back, she stayed behind and made sure the rest of us were all right.
Why, I once fought alongside your father when we were both younger. Saved him from getting his fool head sliced off.
Word is that you found something while you were out there though... something that could be a problem for the Guild.
Word on the street was that Honningbrew tasted better, cost less and Sabjorn didn't shove it down everyone's throat.
Yeah, rub it in. Just imagine what I could get done with my full power and none of these pesky [QUOTE]morals.[QUOTE]
Yeah. I bet I know your guy. He's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens. Paying us good coin for nobody to know about it.
Yes, yes, for the hundredth time, I am a Breton. I was born in High Rock. And then I came here. I am not a Reachman!
Yes. Are you enjoying our little walk together? Or perhaps you'd like to come back when the Lady is taking visitors?
Yes... yes. This is it! I don't know how you found this stranger, but you've obviously succeeded where I had failed.
You fellows happened along just in time. These boys seemed a bit upset at how I've been entertaining their comrades.
You really think I can be a blacksmith someday, papa? As good as Eorlund Gray-Mane? Or maybe... even as good as you?
You started this war, plunged Skyrim into chaos, and now the Empire is going to put you down, and restore the peace.
You vanished after drinking the Torpor and materialized on the other side. I have never seen anything quite like it.
You were young when you first tasted human flesh, weren't you? A brother or sister had died? An accident, of course.
You're under the arrest, for the Murder of Susanna of Candlehearth Hall. And Friga Shatter-Shield. And all the rest.
Your doom already binds you to your dark mistress, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand.
Your freedom? Yes. But even if you were to escape Cidhna Mine, your name would still be stained with all that blood.
A legendary crown, dating back to King Harald's time, or before. A powerful relic of a golden age, long since passed.
Actually, I want you to bring him something. You see, the caravans are notorious for transporting illegal substances.
After that I thought I was turning into a wizard too, because dead things near me would come to life again for while.
Ah, Aegisbane. Sigil of Clan Shatter-Shield. But didn't that get stolen awhile back? Hmph. Must be rememberin' wrong.
Always thought it was odd that there's a layer of thick clouds covering the peak of the mountain above the monastery.
Ancano is exactly why we're so restrictive about access to the College. We'd all have perished if it weren't for you.
And there is more work to be done, but I fear that Kodlak's gotten wind of our recent efforts. He's asked to see you.
And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand girl?
Anyone makes trouble for me and I pay a visit to the Thieves Guild. Make me angry and I contact the Dark Brotherhood.
Anyone suggesting that Restoration is better left to the priests of the Temples, I think, is forgetting a few things.
As promised, let me show you a thing or two about bargaining. Don't want some shifty merchant giving you a raw trade.
As you can imagine, I tend to forget things often. Leave things around. I really must learn to put these things away.
Balimund took me in and has been so kind to me. I don't know why, but he thinks I can be a great blacksmith like him.
Be very careful with that. It sounds as if it may be the Death Ring of Dro'farahn. A ring of the most dangerous sort.
Before Mercer took over, Gallus started collecting every bit of material he could on locations the Guild could heist.
Blasted dark elves. I don't suppose you could tell them that I presently have larger concerns? Such as all of Skyrim?
But around here, there's a tremendous amount of work to get done, not to mention the dangers she's not ready to face.
But I cannot celebrate his fall. Zu'u tiiraaz ahst ok mah. He was my brother once. This world will never be the same.
But if there isn't going to be a wedding, the least you can do is give the ring back. That was one of my best pieces.
But that's nonsense. You can't handle a group of Forsworn by yourself. If their axes don't get you, their magic will.
But the implications are quite intriguing, I think. I simply need some experimental results to confirm my suspicions.
But then during their war with the elves, we had our moment. We drove the Nords out of the Reach in a great uprising.
But, well. Fires go out. Others ignite. Skjor inspired many with his life. Perhaps his death can continue to inspire.
Curalmil was a crafty one, even in death. You would need the skills of a master alchemist to reach his resting place.
Do you know she's slept with three different men in the last month alone? What kind of a woman would do such a thing?
Don't worry, though. Ulfric is our rightful High King. He'll drive out the Empire and Skyrim will have peace at last.
Earned quite a name for myself when I was younger. The Bards College still teaches some of my work to their students.
Filthy she-hound Elisif got what she deserved. Let her serve as [QUOTE]High Queen[QUOTE] of Oblivion, for all I care.
For one, the landowners of the Reach. It goes without saying that they rely heavily on us for our silver and support.
Gettin' pinched and endin' up in jail doesn't cut it with our clients. If you want to get paid next time, stay clean.
Good. And while you're at it, perhaps you should sew your mouth shut when our fine customers are within earshot, hrm?
Grimsever rests with the Dwemer ruin of Mzinchaleft. Tread carefully, friend... those same ruins almost took my life.
He claims you possess some sort of uncanny aptitude for your line of work. Quite frankly I find that hard to believe.
He is most remembered for his great maze of Labyrinthian, said to hold [QUOTE]Glamoril[QUOTE], or the secret of life.
He killed Shagrol in combat, which none of us thought possible. But the winner is made Chief. That is how it is done.
He stokes the passions of the downtrodden in this city. Directs them to kill the enemies of the Forsworn in our name.
Here, I usually pay researchers for their work when they emerge from the ruins, but they won't be needing it anymore.
Hmph. Some of you would be better off keeping quiet than flapping your gums on matters you don't know anything about.
Hurry over to our military camp tucked away in the Reach. Ulfric's been enjoying those silver mines for far too long.
I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the woman we know as Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn.
I assure you, you will not even notice me. Most of them are hardly painful at all to a large dragon such as yourself.
I can't even keep track of all the people who have been in and out of this fort. They come, they go. I barely notice.
I expected better from you Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, and now it seems you help the Empire at every turn.
I heard Vittoria Vici is the Emperor's cousin. I wish he came to the wedding. I never saw a real live Emperor before.
I know who you are, assassin. I guess the rumors about your kind's [QUOTE]extinction[QUOTE] have been... exaggerated.
I need you to find evidence of her corrupt activities, and use it to gain a measure of her [QUOTE]cooperation.[QUOTE]
I picked up the trade when I was a girl. One of the temple healers staying here on a pilgrimage showed me the basics.
I saw it fair when first I trod this long-sought path. The pain and fear vanished, dreamlike, and a vision beckoned -
I suspect you'll be of greater use to us with greater freedom, so you're free to engage the Imperials as you see fit.
I swear, that Aeri and her men would make fine Stormcloak recruits. Pity we can't spare the lumber to conscript them.
I think Illdi's better than Dean Pantea actually knows. She just gets intimidated when she's in class and can't sing.
I was astounded and in turn it lead to a conversation. Who'd have imagined it would lead to such a strong friendship?
I was wondering, father. Maybe you should take a day off and head into town. I could watch the inn while you're away.
I will not lie to you, there is some risk involved. The last time the Torpor was imbibed could have been decades ago.
I'd rather be back at Whiterun, but while I'm here I might as well get some real news from the other parts of Skyrim.
I'll see everyone in Tamriel remember that for a moment, we held the fate of the world in our hands, for good or ill.
I'll tell you what, let me find out where that's from. I'll need to look through my library... and get you an answer.
I'm a man. Skyrim is man's homeland. That's a fact. A fact I'm proud of. There's no shame in that. Read your history.
I'm glad we liberated the Rift. It was dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.
I'm sorry, Ambassador. I didn't mean to cause such a commotion. There's no need to have him thrown out on my account.
I'm sorry, Legate. I didn't want to imply anything about your ability to lead. You're a hero to the Empire, and I....
I'm the fourth person to work the tasting counter in the last year. The last three are at the bottom of Lake Honrich.
I've also heard that it was a spore that fell from an island floating in the sky, but that just sounds like nonsense.
I've been looking for an Amulet of Arkay to remind my wife that our child is with the gods now, but I can't find one.
I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall. Since it's your home as well, I hope to see you and Brynjolf there.
I've heard that you can sell Dwemer artifacts on the black market down in Cyrodiil. They fetch a handsome price, too.
I've heard whispers of more of his work having turned up. If you can track it down, it may prove useful to all of us.
I've no problem with Orcs. But that stronghold they've got in the southeast? Narzulbur? It's an affront to my people.
I've seen some sort of a cave entrance over there. Folks call it [QUOTE]Geirmund's Hall,[QUOTE] but I don't know why.
I've written some letters and placed them in a satchel. Perhaps you wouldn't mind delivering it to them on my behalf?
If Riften can be retaken, I will redouble my efforts to ensure the safety of my subjects and the defense of the Rift.
If we were still living at my alchemy shop in Vivec City, it wouldn't be so bad, she could wander the canals all day.
If you are, then you talk to the man himself. If you're not, well friend, you'd best walk away before this gets ugly.
If you ever feel the need to change your abilities, you can return to the Sepulcher and step onto a different circle.
If you think you can hold Markarth, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor.
If you wish, you may enter my tower to view the museum section, but I'm afraid the laboratories are still off limits.
If you're need of goods, there's a market. If it's a soft bed and a hot meal you're after, there's Candlehearth Hall.
In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain, and the practice of the Voice, we strive to achieve this balance.
In truth, I do not. I have always dreamed of seeing new lands, and it does not hurt that we are making a good profit.
In truth? It was so easy, I feel a bit guilty. Once again, the sweet, innocent child earned more trust than was wise.
Is that what you call it? In the Legion we would have called it [QUOTE]useless.[QUOTE] Look how brittle the metal is!
It has its advantages. I've never liked having the Empire perched on my doorstep. And Riften would be easy to hold...
It seems there's this strange button on the wall opposite the fireplace in my house. Always wondered what it was for.
It was you who fought your kin who didn't understand our cause, who weren't willing to pay the price of our freedom. 
It's a shame you wished for something so dull as me taking back the mutt. Quite the lack of imagination on your part.
It's been a number of years since I've set foot on your world. Or perhaps it's been moments. One tends to lose track.
It's no secret that Jarl Idgrod is... different. It's also no secret that there are rumors about her and her visions.
It's surprising the Council is allowing a Nord rule Riften under the Imperial flag. That can't be their first choice.
Killing someone in a jail is much easier than what the Dark Brotherhood deals with. I guess I wanted to play it safe.
Living or dead, by decree of Shor, none may pass this perilous bridge 'til I judge them worthy by the warrior's test.
Long ago, there lived a mighty hero of the Nords. Olaf One-Eye. Olaf did battle with a fearsome dragon named Numinex.
Lucan at the Riverwood Trader had his store broken into the other night. Oddly enough, barely anything's been stolen.
Madame Ambassador, you know that I would never have behaved... that is to say... well I swear I'm innocent this time!
Madame Endarie insisted. She made it free of charge, in honor of your lenience about last month's rent discrepancies.
Markarth and the Reach are our lands. That is why we are the Forsworn. We cannot claim the home that is rightly ours.
Men are all alike, from Skyrim to Hammerfell. They care only for war and politics, and treat their women like cattle.
Mirabelle, would you please make sure my schedule is clear for the next few days? I'm working on something important.
My daughter, Fura, was assigned to Whiterun after she joined the Imperial Army.  I was hoping you might have met her.
My husband Bersi will be the death of me. He spends too much time worrying about Riften and not enough about himself.
My lady, Maven Black-Briar has sent word that she requires your seal in order to expand her shipments into Morrowind.
My name may not be on the label, but some of my blood, sweat and tears are in every drop. Uh, figuratively of course.
My sister and I inherited a modest sum of money. We decided to travel and seek out whatever adventures we could find.
My steward has such a home available to you for purchase. I think you'll find the accommodations to be most pleasing.
My wife is in mourning and I need to get back to her soon. I'd be much obliged if you could take this to Aela for me.
No. They're high mages, just in from Alinor. I guess Herself is finally getting worried about all the dragon attacks.
No... no, we did the right thing. The temple will take good care of her, and one day she'll be helping all of Skyrim.
Not bad, but it's a little dull. How about you sharpen it up? Just need a bit of metal and the grindstone over there.
Now that Sybille Stentor is out of the picture, I am indeed. And the court is, well... free of her... eccentricities.
Now the crystal needs to be focused. It was created so far away, we knew that some adjustments would have to be made.
Now, I trust you're sharp enough to see that the sword doesn't match the description of the Ebony Blade you may know.
Now, let me show you something else I found... very intriguing... I think your employers may be interested as well...
Oh certainly, dear sister. We couldn't afford to have our customers look like the simple pigs they are, now could we?
Oh, Rexus is no mere servant. He has been with the Motierre family since I was a child. I trust the man with my life.
Oh, yes! The prophecies make clear the signs that will precede the end times. One by one, I have seen them fulfilled.
Olfrid sent ahead his compliments. Looks like his friend Arn is soon to be released thanks to his brand new identity.
Precisely. But it's not as simple as enchanting Malyn away. He's put up barriers. Souls are only allowed in, not out.
Revyn put the word out to his suppliers but with the war on, tools are scarce. Both sides have been snapping them up.
Reyda! You saw Reyda? Did you tell her Narfi cries? Did you tell her Narfi never said goodbye like mother and father?
She is the Goddess of Dawn and Dusk. Azura sees into the Twilight of the future, and guides her followers through it.
She... spoke to you? More treachery! More trickery and deceit! You lie! The Night Mother speaks only to the Listener!
She's bribed countless officials, has friends back in the Imperial City and freely associates with the Thieves Guild.
Shor's bones! What did you do that for? I would have hired the Dark Brotherhood if I'd wanted that! Get away from me.
Sibbi Black-Briar is furious that his ex-lover tried to murder him. He's leaving no stone unturned searching for her.
Since it's your first contract, I'll let you keep whatever Muiri pays. She'll be generous, I'm sure. They always are.
Sithis? Let me guess: [QUOTE]In the Void![QUOTE] By the gods, you Dark Brotherhood are a predictable lot, aren't you?
So. You think you can toy with me, is that it? No, my dear. I have my heart set on you, and I always get what I want.
Some don't even believe they exist, but the Falmer can be devious. Tunneling into homes, stealing off with valuables.
Some say the ship suffered damage to her hull when she struck an iceberg, and Captain Safia can't afford the repairs.
Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.
Talos was a heroic man, but not a god. It pains the Altmer that we must remind our younger cousins of the difference.
Thank you. He's not a bad man, just bad with his coins and his drink. My husband Dagur could tell you stories, there.
Thank you. Here, my father had a favorite sword and shield technique. Let me teach it to you, in honor of his memory.
That thing was a dragon. No doubt. Just like the children's stories and the legends. The harbingers of the End Times.
That's really a shame - I was so looking forward to the wedding. You said you'd have all the most interesting guests.
That's why my brother and I opened a shop to sell hunting supplies. It's the Drunken Huntsman, down by the main gate.
The boy is good at sussing out secrets, but the corruptibility of children is ultimately too limited for my purposes.
The cult's greatest accomplishment was the assassination of the Septim Dynasty and the opening of the Oblivion Gates.
The Dwemer created so many wondrous machines, and yet nobody ever followed in their footsteps. Why is that, I wonder?
The Empire has agreed to accept our beliefs, and its citizens have a responsibility to cease their heretical worship.
The Greybeards have summoned the Dragonborn to High Hrothgar. Such a thing has not happened for... hundreds of years.
The last of the Nightingale Sentinels, I'm afraid. I've defended the Sepulcher alone for what seems like an eternity.
The sealed letter explains everything else, in detail. It should be delivered to your superior. Whomever that may be.
The time has come to fulfill your destiny, Listener. Kill the Emperor, and restore the Dark Brotherhood to greatness.
The worship of Talos outlawed, and now the Thalmor come to conduct their witch-hunts while the Empire stands idly by.
Then one day, I was drunker than I've ever been and mounted a poor colt. Broke his back in two. Haven't ridden since.
There's plenty of good wood around here, but I just can't harvest it all by myself. Everyone able-bodied is fighting.
They haven't made me a guard, even though I've been asking. So I'll take odd jobs, anything that comes along for now.
They're simply scholars, they mean no one harm. I've had... several conversations with Arch-Mage Aren over the years.
This isn't as bad as it seems. I was going to tell Mercer about everything, honestly! Please... he'll have me killed!
This war isn't needed. Imperials like my wife can be hard to handle but we Nords could work with them. I should know.
This was our land. We were here first. Then the Nords came and put chains on us. Forbid us from worshipping our gods.
Those sycophants in the Temple would call her Kynareth. Just a pale shadow of the truth, like all the Temple Divines.
To the Stormcloaks, this was viewed as the moment when the Empire became unworthy of the allegiance of any true Nord.
Very good. And you'll be returning to... Well, if you don't mind me asking, where exactly will you be going now, sir?
We know what path you've set her on. But she has made a different choice. Paarthurnax is still safe from your malice.
We need the Rift. We need to regain control of it before we can march on Windhelm without worry about our rear guard.
We've been soldiers a long time. We know the price of freedom. The people are still weighing things in their hearts. 
We've been staggeringly successful so far. In fact, I'm almost surprised how quickly she's generated business for us.
We've lost a lot of good people to that damn crusade. Drive out the Nords, they say. Well, the Nord ain't driven out.
Well, my friend, if you think those boots needs more coin, I'll make it happen. But I'm doing this for you, not them.
Well, well. Look at you. Your kinsmen have turned you into an animal, Nord. A wild beast caged up and left to go mad.
Well, yes. The designs for my Convector were based on real dwarven machines, so there may still be some in existence.
When the temple was active the priests would rarely be seen in Dawnstar. They preferred to live a solitary existence.
Where to start? Well, the news you heard about Ulfric was true. The Imperials ambushed us outside Darkwater Crossing.
Whiterun, home of the Skyforge. It is said a blade forged in its fires can cut through sinew as if it were parchment.
Without the Lighthouse, the Icerunner will have swung wide of the western shoal and run aground on the eastern coast.
Yes, yes. This here, coming from the mouths of the Nord heroes -- this is the Akaviri symbol for [QUOTE]Shout.[QUOTE]
Yes. Although I rarely use my training. The Greybeards believe the Voice should be used only for worship of Kynareth.
Yes. The finest court in all of High Rock. You think politics here are something? Well, we Bretons invented politics.
Yes. There were a few of us that rebelled against Alduin's thur... his tyranny. We aided the humans in his overthrow.
You are interfering in Imperial business. Yeah, so you'll have to pay us a fine... of say, 100 gold. Pay up, citizen.
You have the blood of the wolf in you. You'll need to build up your strength before you can call on it again, though.
You jest, but they've been able to avoid identification for years. They're obviously well-funded, driven and patient.
You know that I support the Empire, as we all do. However, I fear General Tullius is underestimating the Stormcloaks.
You know, I could have gone into that Sanctuary. Killed all those Dark Brotherhood types. But I was... sick that day.
You may keep my Ebony Mail, a token of my appreciation to my new champion. Its gifts will resonate with your talents.
You must be new to Skyrim, or you'd already know who I am. I have a stake in most anything of importance in Solitude.
You think you can do what he can't, and I'll sell it to you. Then you're free to run off to him with it, if you like.
You'd just spend your time here, bossing me around and yelling for more drinks. You're practically retired already...
You'll have to see the Jarl about that. Maybe his steward, Avenicci. I'm sure one of them will pay you appropriately.
You're different from what I expected, Dragonborn. You treat us with respect, despite your known Imperial sympathies.
You're not sweet-talking your way out of this. Not after what you did. You're headed to Cidhna Mine, and that's that.
Your fellow Stormcloaks are already assembling outside the tomb. I'll meet you there as soon as I'm finished up here.
Your makin' a name for yourself, that's for sure. But more important, you're makin' a name for the Guild. Keep it up.
Your payment waits for you at a dead drop. It is inside an urn, in the very chamber where we first met, in Volunruud.
Your performance has been excellent lately Aia. You still need training but one day you will make an adequate singer.
'Jiit caravan brought this shop a nice piece from Elsweyr. Think you can break into their strongbox and get it for us?
A good many dark elves were driven from the city, and people became... uncomfortable with the presence of the College.
A healer named Jouane saved my life. He's been my closest friend ever since. I tell you, that man is a miracle worker.
A lot of our kind block out the memory of their first meal. The shame is too much. But you don't need to hide anymore.
A mercantile group that has established ports all over Tamriel. They pretty much dominate the whole shipping industry.
Ah, I see. I've just remembered that I saved a few septims in case of an emergency. This is starting to feel like one.
Ah, you're back. Ready to try again, are we? Let's start from the top. You were sent to kill the Gourmet. And he is...
All I can think about is my son, my Thorald... they say that he was killed, but I know better. I know my son is alive!
All I'm asking is that you clean up once in a while. How you can find anything in your half of the place is beyond me.
And I might be old myself, but I'll kick those damn walls down with my bare feet! - if you would only ask me to do it!
And if you contracted Sanguinare Vampiris, be sure to get that taken care of. Else you'll end up like our own Babette.
And they got the orders backwards. Ha ha ha.  Yes, I'm writing that in.  It should be good for a laugh from the court.
And we understand a rebel garrison is close to abandoning the resistance. We need to send them a little encouragement.
Are you all right? I heard the commotion. Who was Cicero talking to? Where's the accomplice? Reveal yourself, traitor!
As for myself, you've proven your mastery twice over. Thuri, Dovahkiin. I gladly acknowledge the power of your Thu'um.
As they always have, along with those crazed Forsworn. They've driven off the color that used to make this city great.
Aye, that he was. And you sniffed him out because he broke one of the cardinal rules of our business... he got greedy.
Aye, that I did. I commanded a force of several dozen men, most of them levies from villages in this part of the hold.
Aye, the war keeps the Empire and the locals too busy to worry about us. Haldyn calls it [QUOTE]our golden age.[QUOTE]
Because I did something not a soul in this bloodstained house of war has the backbone to do... dared to speak my mind.
Blocking Pale Pass would cut one of the main Imperial supply routes... and would leave Whiterun dangerously exposed...
Bold words, Battle-Born. While you're meting out justice to traitors, are you going to deal with the Emperor, as well?
But if you live in fear of what might go wrong, you'll end up doing nothing. Like the Greybeards up on their mountain.
But it's more than that. Nazeem is obsessed with this civil war, as is all of Skyrim. I swear, it will consume us all.
But now I wander, weary and lost. Alduin hunts me as we once hunted our prey - a bitter payment for many bloody deeds.
But perhaps the staff can absorb some of the energy coming out of the Eye, weaken it. Allow us to get close to Ancano.
But wherever that dragon came from, and whatever it wants, Ulfric will get to the bottom of it. You can count on that.
But you should know that these killings are but a means to an end. For they pave the way to the most important target.
Death is my art, and like all artists, I seek a patron. For a mere handful of gold, I will follow you into any danger.
Difficult? I am a Jarl. I eat the most succulent meat, drink the finest ale and hunt with the best hounds in the hold.
Do not be so sure about that. Beware - the Blades may claim to serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have.
Do you think Ulfric really cares about Skyrim's independence, or the welfare or its people? I promise you, he doesn't.
Don't know. Creepy fella, black robe. Couldn't see his face. Paid me a pretty sum to get that into your hands, though.
Don't worry about Malborn. He's not a dangerous character like you, but he hates the Thalmor at least as much as I do.
Dov wahlaan fah rel. We were made to dominate. The will to power is in our blood. You feel it in yourself, do you not?
Finally, someone with decent sense. The Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos.
First, I need to get a handle on rebel operations. Need to discretely liberate some documents from their headquarters.
Fjola, my wife, left the farm on errands and never came back. It's been months, and I've been searching for her since.
Fletching suits me. It's difficult, and sometimes tedious. But a well made arrow strikes forth like the fury of a god.
Fortunately, those most opposed to the Emperor's wise policy have now branded themselves traitors as well as heretics.
Good, got a buyer in a rush for this item. If you hurry we can turn it around and make a quick profit. Can you get it?
Good. If I need to light a few fires in order to get what we need to defend this place from the Stormcloaks, so be it.
Happy? No, I am not happy. Zeymahi lost ont du'ul Bormahu. Alduin was once the crown of our father Akatosh's creation.
Have you met her? She runs the forge near the smelter. Just don't bother talking to her apprentice. Boy has no talent.
He comes by to perform Boethiah's insulting rites at my altar, but he's been missing. Captured and bound. Left to rot.
He couldn't just kill me, you see. We're technically part of each other. But he was able to banish me from his domain.
Here, some gold as promised, and let me show you a bit about wearing heavy armor. Save you some aches on a long march.
Here, why don't you take this. It was intended to be given to the best in their group as a reward for their hard work.
Here's my sword. Go take it up to Eorlund to have it sharpened. And be careful, it's probably worth more than you are.
Him? Oh... Ah, name's Balablob or Malaclob, one of them funny Orc names. Talks real good, though. Not a savage at all.
Hmm. Helgen, eh? Ulfric told us quite the story. If you made it through all that, you're likely worth something to me.
Hmm... the Empire is bringing in a lot of supplies through Dawnstar. Taking the Pale would stretch them pretty thin...
Hmph. How about, instead of giving you another contract, I simply deride you for not finishing the one you still have?
I apologize if I have not been clear about my work. I didn't want to discuss it for fear this moment might never come.
I can get you into one of those parties. Once you're inside the Embassy, you get away and find Elenwen's secret files.
I didn't know it when we were... with each other... but Alain is actually the leader of a band of cutthroats. Bandits.
I don't care if she can find a living dwarf -- I can't have her stirring up trouble. We have enough problems as it is.
I don't know what sort of help you expect from me, but if you can actually find the crystal I'd certainly be grateful.
I don't know you so we've got nothing to talk about. How about you finish the job Brynjolf gave you, then we can talk.
I don't think I'll be content until Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim with the ashes of the Concordat at his feet.
I don't think so. How do I know you won't continue to extort me? A wagon loaded with silver isn't good enough for you?
I even went to the College of Winterhold. But they just laughed at me. The magic is in the staff, not in me they said.
I have spread rumors of an assassin. It will make your job harder, but will allow me to place blame where I desire it.
I joined with Bashnag then, but I thought of Savela every day. So I snuck off, hoping to find and steal away with her.
I just wanted to try on your old armor, from back when you were a soldier. I thought I might be old enough to wear it.
I know it looks bad, but we've got to figure out what happened. And if that dragon is still skulking around somewhere.
I met with several of the Dark Elves to discuss improvements in the Gray Quarter, but we have no real plans as of yet.
I remember a cutpurse trying to rob me on the road once. When I drew Grimsever, I think the poor man soiled his armor!
I think one of those volumes may have had some relevant information. If you want them, you'll have to talk to Orthorn.
I tried to tell them. They wouldn't listen. Fools. It's all come true... all I could do was watch our doom approach...
I was the finest scout in the Legion, once. Tracked down all the places in the wilds that were causing people trouble.
I will kill this jester if you so desire, but there is a disturbance in the Void. Our Dread Father does not wish this.
I wish more had the dedication and strength of character that you demonstrate. I'll be sure this gets put to good use.
I'd rather not tangle with her right now. Let's try to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and watch where you step.
I'm sorry, but even Mara's Temple needs coin. We will have a symbol ready for you when you come back with enough gold.
If a dragon does show up, maybe we'll get lucky and it will eat the mages first. Might give us enough time to kill it.
If something's being handed to you on a silver platter, then there's a catch... steal the platter instead. You get it?
If you fancy keeping your purse filled with gold and your head on your shoulders, I'd stay out of those awful tunnels.
If you know any true sons and daughters of Skyrim, tell them to head to Windhelm. Ulfric Stormcloak wants to see them.
If you think this war is nearly won, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor.
If you've business with the College, you're welcome to stay here. It's where most of our business comes from, in fact.
In defeating these Stormcloak traitors, you have proven the hollowness of their cause and the fullness of your hearts.
It is vital that we bring Ulfric to justice, but that cannot happen until his army of Stormcloaks is defeated utterly.
It is. We train the bards you hear throughout the land. Viarmo is the head of the college and in charge of admissions.
It'd be good to have that staff in case the Jarl starts wondering if I actually have a real connection to the College.
It's not my place to get involved in their family's business, remember? You're the one that told me to stay out of it.
It's said that Mankar Camoran used the book to open a portal to a Paradise where all his followers would live forever.
Let me give you a piece of advice. If you want to make some serious coin in this business you need to listen to rules.
Malyn wanted to alter the Star. He was dying. Disease. He thought he could store his own soul inside. Become immortal.
Maybe, but the way you burn through all that wood to keep the cabin toasty, they might mistake this place for Elsweyr.
Me? No, I'm too important to the war effort to risk life and limb in there... Besides, that's what I'm paying you for.
My family is everything to me.  Clear the fort and on top of the posted reward you can have whatever items you'd like.
My wife was a good woman. She could be a little hard-headed sometimes, but I loved her just the same. Gods I miss her.
Not lost, you see, just forgotten. The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps...
Not sure. I know that it starts with Moon Sugar, but all sorts of other ingredients are added to increase its potency.
Now is not the time to fight amongst ourselves. I fear dark days approach and all of Skyrim's strength will be needed.
Now, I know who you are. And... and I know your business... Just, please... These are good folk we got here. Mostly...
Now, I'm not sure that you're quite as attuned as I am, given my extensive years of experience, but can you feel that?
Oblivion take the Thalmor! I'll never give up Talos, not even if it means my life. Let them come and make me a martyr!
Oh, a brutish one. Septimus has no fear of you. But as one block raises another, perhaps ourselves could help us each.
Oh, and Legate. It's been an honor to have you at my side. As a token of my appreciation, I want you to keep my sword.
One more thing. If you get caught, I can't afford to be connected to you. Remember that before you do anything stupid.
Only the ones I'm not sure about. This will prove your abilities, but more importantly, it will prove your commitment.
Orchendor and his Afflicted are meant to stand ready, awaiting Peryite's command to cover the world with his Blessing.
Part of the cost of peace. Emperor Titus Mede saved his Empire at a very high price. A price that included the Blades.
Please, I know I'm asking you to do something difficult, maybe even dangerous. I just don't know who else I can trust.
Ranmir's a good boy, and he doesn't deserve what fate pushed his way, but there's only so far I'll go to risk my neck.
She needs to learn to eat what I serve her. I swear, you spoil that child rotten. Besides, it's one of your favorites.
She was responsible for the Empire's near collapse almost five hundred years ago. I believe I have a book about her...
Slow down, you have that special request in Windhelm to finish first. After that's done, I'll send you some more jobs.
So I've kept my mouth shut. Like I said, his family is better off believing he's gone, because he's never coming back.
So if you're getting any ideas about selling it to someone else or keeping it, you'll find it would hold little value.
So you understand my fear. If Cicero's planning something, and conspiring with one of our own, it would be disastrous.
So, is this what it's come to? You'd have your own flesh and blood hanged just to solidify your grip as the next Jarl?
Some of us wanted to find out how. I was working under Malyn Varen, then. If only we knew what he was really planning.
Still, a little knowledge of plants and potions can get you by. Not that anyone likes to admit buying things from you.
Succeed, and you may keep your title and my armor, and I shall write your name upon the Tablet of Absolute Blackness. 
Sure am! I thank my lucky stars every time I look to the night sky that Maven took me in and gave me this opportunity.
Sure I am. We get some furs and tree branches, paint them white, and then tie them to Stump. Instant Frostbite Spider!
Thanks to Ulfric's rebellion, countless innocent people can't feed or clothe their families. It's unacceptably tragic.
That doesn't mean I support everything the Empire's been doing lately, but Nords have never been fair-weather friends.
That tablet is your priority now. Bring that back from Bleak Falls Barrow and I'm sure we'll have a lot to talk about.
That's right. Used to explore all over. I'm the one who originally found the mine Darkwater Crossing was built around.
The Empire has stretched itself too far. This rebellion in Skyrim is one problem, but solving it won't fix everything.
The Empire might try an take the city back, or worse, we'll get a visit from a dragon. We've got to be ready for both.
The fall forest makes me miss my childhood; playing among the towering trees in Valenwood and living with my brethren.
The farmer is at his farm! Where else would he be? Loreius is his name. Talk to him. Convince him to help poor Cicero.
The Guild stocks the place full of thugs that aren't good enough to join, so watch yourself if you venture down there.
The Whalebone Bridge he bade me guard and winnow all those souls whose heroic end sent them here, to Shor's lofty hall
Then, if you should happen upon the corpse of a dragon, you should be able to use it to slice off a heartscale or two.
There is too much to learn in the world, too much to know, to fight over [QUOTE]laws[QUOTE] that have no real purpose.
There was an... unfortunate incident a few years ago. An elven mage named Nelacar was exiled from the College over it.
There's a College in Winterhold that teaches magic. It's very secretive, though, and you know how people hate secrets.
These men are ruthless. Cunning, deceitful... they'll pay off whoever they can. I can't trust anyone here in Whiterun.
They carried out a genocide of dragons when they first came to Tamriel, and now they will do it again, with your help.
This is Kynesgrove. Not much to look at. The innkeeper ought to be able to tell us if there's any dragon mound nearby.
This isn't about religion or destiny. This is nothing more than a business transaction between yourself and Nocturnal.
This was the first door in Skyrim I knocked upon, and little did I know my future husband would be answering the door.
Torygg's father Istlod had held Skyrim together for nearly twenty-five years. When he died, Torygg became that symbol.
Two of the gems, the ones on the outside, represent the couple to be married... one for the husband, one for the wife.
Ulfric is a fool and a coward, who naively believes he can bring about peace through warfare. It's rather sad, really.
Unlike Ulfric, Brunwulf has shown a great willingness to work with the other races and make us feel more at home here.
Very funny. My master is Clavicus Vile, Daedric prince of wishes. As you can imagine, he's quite the important person.
Very well. These specially enchanted gloves will allow you to delve directly into the focal points for these energies.
Vex was waiting for me at the Flagon when I came in... drenched in sweat. Everyone just took a look at me and laughed.
We have guests as often as we can but there aren't a lot of travellers these days. The war keeps people off the roads.
We have never concerned ourselves with the Scrolls. The gods themselves would rightly fear to tamper with such things.
We're going to go there, and you're going to kill that dragon. If we succeed, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
We've been hired to deal with some pests in Hjaalmarch. Someone's got them riled up, and you need to put an end to it.
Well, as I said, Arkay is the god of life and death. You'll find his temples and Halls of the Dead all across Tamriel.
Well, I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?
Well, I seem to have misplaced it at the moment. But it was white, like alabaster, with three bright rubies set in it.
Well, since she's not using it anymore, Ulfric might just let you have it, if you have the money. And if he likes you.
What about [QUOTE]Auntie Faida[QUOTE] in Dragon Bridge? She runs a bar, and you said she's one of your favorite girls!
What's wrong? You have to look at the blood closely to see the quality of the meat. How else will you know it's fresh?
When I was a young acolyte of Vaermina, I paid my dues in a shrine located within the catacombs of a fort in Cyrodiil.
Yeah, I think I know who you mean. He's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here, but I guess I can tell you.
Yes, brother. I'm sure they'll agree it's a fair price to pay in order to avoid interacting with you on a daily basis.
Yes, yes, so you said. But so what? The end is upon us. I may as well die here as anywhere else. I'm tired of running.
Yes. Braith bullies me all the time. All the elders think I'm a milk drinker 'cause I can't fight. Nobody understands.
You always were a fool, Ulfric. You'll never get a better chance to salvage something from the ruins of your ambition.
You ask if I'm worried? I'm terrified, if you want to truth of it. But I have to stay strong for my wife and children.
You come here, kill my assistants, disrupt my work... You've annoyed me, so I don't think I'll be giving you anything.
You have a kind heart. I'd be honored to walk by your side until the trees themselves fade away, if you would have me.
You lookin' for Falion? Why don't you go bother those mages at their College in Winterhold and leave my brother alone?
You lost the trust of the people of Skyrim, Elisif. You had your chance to make the right choice when the war started.
You mean before he died? We had a break in. Thieves didn't touch anything on the shelves, or any coin, just one thing.
You show great passion for battle, and compassion for those we fight for. You are becoming indispensable to our cause.
You what? How could you run out? J'zargo gave you more than enough. Bah, just forget J'zargo ever asked for your help.
You will rely on your skill as a mage. Not on your belongings, not on your scrolls and potions. Only what lies within.
You're bloated with disease. The Vigilant of Stendarr can help you, as long as you promise to never assist the Daedra.
You're joking, right? Rjorn? Only the most famous battle drummer of the second age. Well, famous among bards at least.
You've come to the wrong city, then. Windhelm's a haven of prejudice and narrow thinking, unworthy of one such as you.
You've truly earned the Blessing of Dibella, child. Prostrate yourself before her altar, and she will bestow her gift.
Your question carries more weight than you may know, newcomer. The sort of thing some of us spend our lives pondering.
A fateful errand.  No few have chafed to face the Worm since first he set his soul-snare here at Sovngarde's threshold.
A few people in the Warrens used to work here. Degaine broke some bones a while back. Eltrys quit. Cairine is too sick.
A man goes crazy in the market. Everyone knows he's a Forsworn agent. Guards do nothing. Nothing but clean up the mess.
After that? Probably just stick around here. Saw some good game on my way here, and I'd like to stay close for a while.
Ah, the young and stupid. Always mocking the experienced and brilliant. My contract went very well, I'll have you know.
Ah, you're back. So, how went your first real contract? A bit more exciting than what Nazir's been offering, I'd wager.
All Shouts are made up of three Words of Power. As you master each Word, your Shout will become progressively stronger.
And I have already received word that the client is satisfied. You have done well for yourself, and for the Companions.
And if you're just looking to feel good, go get some Spiced Wine from Evette. But whatever you do, just leave me alone.
And not just any dragon, but the Dragon - Alduin, the World-Eater, the dragon who devours both the living and the dead.
Arch-Mage Aren assures me that his people had nothing to do with it, and I believe him. But Winterhold never recovered.
Are you referring to your other customers? No, everything is quite all right. I expect a bit of animosity now and then.
Are you sure? Once I exchange it for you, I'm not taking it back... unless you want to sell it at a discount of course.
Aye, mum. That we will. Mares, stallions, donkeys - I don't think it matters. Pretty sure I can sell any steeds we get.
But now he's refusing to deliver. Could you perhaps speak with him, and see if we can come to some sort of arrangement?
But our greatest weapon? Courage. For if we cannot kill the beast, we must at least have the tenacity to drive it back.
But that old bellyacher just fed me some nonsense about light ruining his mixtures and being close to the water... agh.
But they'll keep you busy. Just do them as you're able. There's no real time limit - the targets aren't going anywhere.
But while you live, the Dark Brotherhood lives. We must fulfill our contract. Emperor Titus Mede II must be eliminated.
But you disappeared! You were there... then you weren't! Did you mean to help poor Cicero or not? I'm left to wonder...
By the gods! If it's a good ending to some damn story you're after - perhaps the Dragonborn should be the one to do it.
By the love of the Nine, what is it with you sycophants and hangers on? The jarl is busy! And so am I, for that matter.
Delphine? How do you... so you've finally found her, and she led you to me. And here I am, caught like a rat in a trap.
Dibella is the Divine of Beauty. She is a patron deity to artists and bards and those who seek life's simple pleasures.
Do I? And what about you? What right did you have to meddle in my affairs? Kill my people? Was it worth it? Your truth?
Eldergleam is older than metal, from a time before men or elves. To even affect it, you have to tap into the old magic.
Everyone knows it's the College's fault that the sea swallowed our city. Still they deny it, but we all know the truth.
First off, let's keep this between us. I picked these up from the graves in town so don't go blabbing about it to Kust.
First off, we've learned the location of some rebels scouting our positions throughout the hold. Need to take them out.
First we'll need to refill our coffers and stockpile stone and wood. The war took a heavy toll on Windhelm's resources.
For the last two hundred years, we've been searching for the next Dragonborn to guide and guard, as we are sworn to do.
Glad to hear all my hard work has paid off. Maybe we'll fetch a better price for our crops next time we're in the city.
Got a message from one of my people that this place just came into some coin. Should be a good target. Want to take it?
He asks a price -- to work his will. A few murders, some dissent spread, a plague or two. For the secrets I can endure.
He finally came to realize that the gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Voice.
He has suggested that, should he find out who is responsible, he is well versed in making things disappear permanently.
He's making too much racket and I'm trying to get Vex drunk. So I tell him to keep it down and he just runs me through.
Heating and cooling the crystal will cause it to expand or contract, which will change how the light passes through it.
Here you stand, talking to a married woman. Why? Am I that interesting? Or perhaps there are other things on your mind.
Hmm. I'm not sure how you managed it, but these are exactly what I need to start my next set of experiments. Wonderful!
Hmm... we've heard whispers of an enchanted pair of gauntlets, hidden and protected by dangerous men, beasts, or worse.
I am your better half. And your better half is telling you to stop being an idiot and serve the customers their drinks!
I am. The Blades of the 2nd Era hunted down many dragons in their day, and they have records of where the beasts lived.
I can't remember the last time I visited home. Think I've forgotten what a proper bed looks like, let alone feels like.
I can't talk about it. Rest assured, the Jarl hears everyone's concerns. You will be able to visit the dead again soon.
I do so love Riften. I journeyed here in my youth. A thief took my purse... so I took his eyes. It was a fair exchange.
I don't care! Just stay away from the soldiers and keep to your business. It's the only way we'll make it through this.
I don't know much. Only the old tales about the ancient heroes who would use the Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim.
I don't really have anything against her - not her fault that her husband Torygg was bought and paid for by the Empire.
I had particularly high hopes for her. Once she'd overcome her difficulties, she could have been quite successful here.
I have met Daedra and Dwemer and everything in between and I know enough to see a vampire where others would see a man.
I hope this deal goes through. I'm putting quite a bit of coin on the line... and the last two you set up fell through.
I like to spend time up here. Walk the Steps, meditate on the emblems. Doesn't hurt when I bag some game along the way.
I may not live to see this little one grow into a new Gildergreen, but I can be remembered as the woman who planted it.
I never thought I'd ever willingly stand in the same room with Tullius again. At least not without a weapon in my hand.
I see in your eyes that you think I jest. I assure you, I don't. I am proud, and rightfully so, of the work we do here.
I speak figuratively, of course. Nothing could be more unlikely than that someone would actually want her in their bed.
I suppose I could copy his style based on what you brought me but I have no idea what happened in between these verses.
I thought you might not remember your first trip here. You had a big night. I think you've definitely earned the staff.
I was going to give this to whomever killed her for me, but I suppose you've earned it by bringing me this information.
I will just... rest here a moment. Although it is damnably cold out here. I don't look forward to the trip back down...
I won't say it again, Vignar - Talos worship is forbidden. It's the Empire's law, and we're still a part of the Empire.
I... I feel terrible about what happened. About what I did. It would probably be best for everyone if I just went away.
I'll take your money, but I make no promises of a large return on your investment. These are troubled times, after all.
I'm glad you'll be with me in there. I don't like the looks of this place... and I'm not talking about the Stormcloaks.
I'm not angry with you. Tell you what, lover. Meet me in my chambers later and we can discuss the situation in private.
I'm pleased when the palace is clean, I'm pleased when the beds are made on time, I'm pleased when I Erdi isn't around.
I'm still trying to find a suitable contract for you. Continue to work with Nazir on the, um, supplemental assignments.
I'm sure that, in time, this little sapling will grow into a new Gildergreen that will tower over Whiterun. Thank you. 
I'm taking mother to a new home. A new crypt. But... aggh! Wagon wheel! Damnedest wagon wheel! It broke! Don't you see?
I'm thinking of composing a song about you, Jonna. Would you prefer that I proclaim your beauty, your strength, your...
I'm with the Vigil of Stendarr. We believe this house might have been used for Daedra worship. Evil rites and so forth.
I've been a daughter of Skyrim all my life. I love this land and her people. So do all the Nords that serve the Empire.
I've sent men to scout out the area. You are to meet them, find a way to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort.
If you could call it that. The Jarl can make all the demands in the world, I'm not setting one foot on the battlefield.
If you think you can steal my throne by winning the hearts of the people, that's where you're wrong. Keep that in mind.
In mythic times, when mortalkind was in great need, the goddess Kynareth granted us the ability to speak as dragons do.
Is that so? Does the name Gleda ring a bell? The star beauty of my farm? Kidnapped by a drunk lout and sold to a Giant?
It seems that the gods have grown tired of us. They've left us to our fate, as the plaything of Alduin the World-Eater.
It was a bit difficult to come to the ways of Mara at first, but my fellow priests were kind and quite patient with me.
It was Ri'saad's idea to come here now, while the land is in turmoil. Where others saw only danger, he saw opportunity.
It was some experiment gone horribly wrong. Ghastly results, I was told. And his ghost still roams the halls, they say.
It's a fundamental rule of magic and it would be ridiculous. You can't draw from harmonic energy without a soul siphon.
It's been brought to my attention that the poison known as skooma may be present in our city. What do you know of this?
It's comforting to see that not everyone has dismissed it as entirely as most members of the College. Truly comforting.
It's not the friendliest place for outsiders. The Dark Elves were all forced to live in a slum called the Gray Quarter.
It's not wise to discuss it here. Please, if you truly wish to help, meet me at my home. I'll tell you the whole story.
It's the capital of Whiterun Hold, the biggest and the best of the nine holds of Skyrim. But don't take my word for it.
It's where a client pays you to get arrested, and you get thrown into a prison for the express purpose of breaking out.
Jarl Igmund sits on the Mournful Throne. You can find him in the keep, in the back end of the city inside the mountain.
Killing Gaius Maro in a city will be challenging because of all the guards, but fights, even murder, are fairly common.
Look, here is Alduin! This panel goes back to the beginning of time, when Alduin and the Dragon Cult ruled over Skyrim.
Look, I traded a staff to someone and found out later that was a bad idea. So, I'd like the staff back. Understand now?
Look, if you just want to sit around the Flagon all day getting drunk, that's your business. Just quit wasting my time.
Look, this is really simple. I lent him some gold, he promised to pay me back and now he says he's broke. End of story.
Maven Black-Briar needs Goldenglow's honey for her mead. She's been using the Guild to keep the Estate under her thumb.
Maybe Nazeem's obsession has merit. This civil war seems so big, so unceasing... I'm afraid, Danica. Afraid for us all.
More than you'll ever realize. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot.
Most of this I purchased while my comrades were fighting in the south, helping the Empire against the Aldmeri Dominion.
Muiri? Muiri? So, what, you're the cow's champion? Oh, now that is rich. Well then, champion, let's get this over with.
My sister is blind. I've told her she shouldn't spend so much time with Yatul, but she won't listen. Thinks she's nice.
My time has come. I am old. Too old to become chief. It would be wrong for me to take wives at this age. So I will die.
Nchuand-Zel? The ruins underneath Markarth? The wealth of artifacts that I've based two human lifetimes of research on?
Nosy one, huh? I was a mage back in Morrowind. I lend my talents to the mines here, helping them keep the tunnels safe.
Not right now. I'm going to look at some of these carvings. I wonder if Ysgramor ever set foot here while he was alive.
Now, that's it. One free outfit per soldier. You lose that, or get it banged up, you'll need to pay like everyone else.
Obviously. You should visit the Bloodworks to talk to Wuunferth -- we need to figure out where the evidence went wrong.
Occasionally. But an Orc blade is a very personal thing. Anger, regret, pride. All these things are put into our steel.
Of course it bothers me! I'm sure it's only a matter of time until they seize our mill in the name of their war effort.
Oh, my furtive friend. When Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, there will be gold... a fortune in gold. But so much more!
Oh, yes sir. I feel many of Solitude's families are having trouble getting by, and the wealthy do nothing to help them!
Oh, you heard about that, huh? Uh, sorry boss. I was going to speak to Delvin about cutting the Guild in, but I forgot.
Pavo and Gat are the only survivors. I'll be sending word to the Jarl about this, but I don't know when help will come.
Peace? I doubt it. They may put their weapons down for a moment, but only to gather strength for the next bloodletting.
People say there's a man wandering the streets near the Blue Palace. He seems distressed but he's not making any sense.
Sadly, they're proving elusive but I have confidence that Maven won't give up until this city has been rid of them all.
Say, if you're traveling, could you keep an eye out for them? Valdr and his men. I think they were after bear up north.
She had a book with her, [QUOTE]Song of the Alchemists,[QUOTE] that I used to read over and over. I miss having a copy.
So, stop your worrying and get some rest. Your shift is coming up and I don't want you dozing off again like last time.
Soon enough, it'll be me. In the meanwhile, the Circle handles our daily routine, and Kodlak advises them as Harbinger.
Spriggans. Niels went down before we even knew to run. Ari died just inside. I never even thought the things were real.
Stick close. Damn rebels could be anywhere. Don't worry, though. General Tullius will have them on the run soon enough.
Thank you. I'm still at the beginning of my lessons but Inge... Dean Six Fingers... says I'm quite good with the flute.
Thanks. Papa talks about it some. Mum doesn't say much since Uncle Roggvir died. She doesn't even go to Temple anymore.
That what he's really doing is spying for the Thalmor, trying to feed them information. Whether it's true, I can't say.
That's right, mock the town beggar like everyone else. But I've got a right to browse, don't I? I ain't hurtin' anyone.
The [QUOTE]Great War[QUOTE]... there was nothing great about it. Thousands died on both sides, and where did it get us?
The Blackblood Marauders are... very identifiable. I didn't want anyone thinking the Blackbloods were getting too bold.
The Emperor has requested your signature dish - the Potage le Magnifique. I've taken the liberty of getting it started.
The Gray Quarter in Windhelm is little better than a slum. It's shameful that the dark elves are made to live that way.
The Jarl can be found in the Great Hall, probably sitting on his Jarl's throne. Not over here in a wizard's laboratory.
The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I wish to honor you, Dragonborn and the truest of Stormcloaks.
The only way into Windhelm is across this bridge. Keep moving, stay close, and we'll be through their gates in no time.
The rebels have agreed to cease hostilities until we hash out this treaty. Suffice it to say I'm not holding my breath.
The Sea of Ghosts practically came alive. No one was expecting it. Monstrous waves battered the shore for weeks on end.
The Voice was a gift of the goddess Kynareth, at the dawn of time. She gave mortals the ability to speak as dragons do.
Then there's Ingun Black-Briar. Bright young thing and a worthy apprentice, when she isn't wasting my rare ingredients.
There are no heroes in this war. Even with Ulfric here in Solitude, there are no winners to be had. No real conclusion.
There's a foul presence coming from Darklight Tower, southwest of the city. Some say the place is home to necromancers.
There's a poem I once used on an older lady of Rorikstead. I can change it to be about Faleen, if you've got some gold.
There's another piece, that Kodlak always kept close to himself. Would you go to his chambers and bring it back for me?
There's one out on the road. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company.
There's some trouble in Eastmarch. Farmers getting troubled by some bad types who've built up a stronghold in the area.
They are discreet and thorough, though not inexpensive. I hope you'll keep that in mind, should the worst come to pass.
They say they're too busy with the war -- I say what good is winning a war if we're still terrorized by one of our own?
This Agent of Strife can send forth a tendril of pure darkness into the heart of another, causing great injury to them.
This business is a regular target for the Guild. They keep pretty shoddy records, so the job should be a cinch. You in?
This was not the intention, to be sure. It is true that J'zargo was slightly concerned there may have been... problems.
Ulfric doesn't care about Talos. He yearns for the throne of Skyrim and he'll say anything to rally people to his side.
Ulfric's right-hand man, Galmar Stonefist, has located what he believes is the final resting place of the Jagged Crown.
We don't have travelers from Elsweyr or Hammerfell anymore, Endon. Only the natives and the Nords stay in Markarth now.
We may both end up dead, but at least it gets me out of Riverwood. I don't really think I'm cut out for the quiet life.
We Orc men are not like these Nords and Imperials who carry on until they are grey and feeble and their hair falls out.
We surrender. The capital is yours. If you pledge no harm will come of my people, I turn over the seat of power to you.
We're a small meadery, but growing quickly. Sabjorn's only been running this place for a short time now and look at it.
We're fighting because our own Jarls, once strong, wise men, have become fearful and blind to their people's suffering.
We're still growin' by leaps and bounds thanks to you. Another merchant's just moved into the space outside the Flagon.
Welcome. Look around. We've got everything you could want in life. At least... that's what my Beirand always told me...
Well, aren't you sweet? I'd be happy to give you some alchemy training in exchange for the ring, if you bring it to me.
What? I didn't... hmm? No, listen, you must have misunderstood... I would never openly insult your... that is to say...
When will you be makin' some more jewelry, love? Some silver lockets and amulets would fetch a nice price at the stand.
When you walked into my inn that day, I never imagined where it would all lead... dragons out of legend... Sovngarde...
Which is why I have lived here. For thousands of mortal years I have waited. I knew where he would emerge but not when.
Who knows how many spies the Empire has sent into our midst already. We're at war. This isn't the time for hospitality.
Why would Tullius waste resources getting the crown only to give it to me? Poisoned perhaps? No. He's not that cunning.
Why, this very palace was built by one of Balgruuf's ancestors to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name - Dragonsreach.
Yes, I suppose you're right. Forgive me. I've lost several close friends to the Falmer and it tends to distort my view.
Yes, milady. That unpleasantness at Helgen supposedly involved a dragon. It killed several soldiers before it departed.
You are in Eldergleam Sanctuary - just a small glimpse of what beauty Kynareth has to offer. Wonderful place, isn't it?
You are not the first. There have been many of the Dragon Blood since Akatosh first bestowed that gift upon mortalkind.
You did something for me, I'm gonna do something for ya'. Here, take the key to Mercer's house. Won't need it any more.
You have proven your point, Viarmo.  The festival is truly a celebration of Solitude and a condemnation of false kings.
You there! Fool! Hold fast. You've been accused of a crime against the laws of this land. What say you in your defense?
You, my dear, can earn the Blessing of Dibella. You'll find men to be more pliable in the future... or more vulnerable.
You! You're the one who wiped out the Dark Brotherhood! All the guards are talking about it... You're a hero to us all!
You've been suspended from the College for what you did. You'd better talk to Tolfdir if you want to get it sorted out.
Your efforts have helped illuminate the entire province. I trust by now you've achieved a higher comprehension of love.
A man of my station has many debts. I'm not much use at labor or learning, but I can throw a punch with the best of 'em.
A witchhunter from the Priesthood of Stendarr is in town. He's asking a lot of questions about that old abandoned house.
A word of advice, keep away from the Keep and the city guards. They follow their own path and have already forsaken Her.
Ah, you're back. It was good to fight alongside you. I'm sure people won't be forgetting that wedding anytime soon, hmm?
Alduin's Wall was where the ancient Blades recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy.
All right, all right. I guess I made enough from his shipment. No need to waste any more time threatening a stable hand.
And last is the soul gem. I left that one in Windhelm at the White Phial alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well.
As if this craggy, wretch of a city could give birth to a superiorly bred Mer such as myself. No, I'm not from Markarth.
As long as Ulfric wishes Elisif to remain Jarl, remain Jarl she will. And the Thanes will continue to follow her orders.
Bashnag's circle of mages. We - well [QUOTE]they[QUOTE] live here. They made it pretty clear that I'm no longer welcome.
Bear in mind, even if you clear out the tomb, you'll still need a key to get to the treasure. A key I happen to possess.
Before the Oblivion Crisis, many elves called Winterhold their home. More visited the College from Morrowind every year.
Besides, you've done Maven a favor getting rid of him and saved me from wasting coin hiring someone else to do it later.
Between the two of us, there are rumors about him. That this [QUOTE]advisor[QUOTE] position he has is a sham, an excuse.
Beware the region northeast, across the river. Forsworn have taken refuge in Broken Tower Redoubt and Red Eagle Redoubt.
But I suppose everyone gets the jitters before their wedding. And I did say you could take a bit of time paying me back.
City folk might look down on us, but what's wrong with farming? Everything we've got, we had to earn with our own sweat.
Concentration spells can be cast immediately, though they're weaker. Good for a tight spot, and less costly if you miss.
Dawnstar has a history of being the site of battles that have crippled the fate of the Empire. I hope this remains true.
Decided to go through with it then? I knew you couldn't have forgotten about your fiance. You spoke of her so glowingly.
Did she, now? Well, as it turns out, there are a few lingering contracts we haven't had the chance to complete just yet.
Ever since you scared off that thug from the Thieves Guild, not one of them's bothered me. We're lucky to have you here.
Every day, he deals with obsequious functionaries and incompetent bureaucrats. Sadly, I'm not allowed to eliminate them.
Excellent! You aren't the first to have a change of heart, after seeing what Ulfric's reckless pride is doing to Skyrim.
From the Imperial City, our war here is just a sideshow. An interlude before the main event against the Thalmor resumes.
Good. The dragon's soul should be making you stronger. Come back another time, and we'll track down another one for you.
He provided the funds to start this caravan, and put me in charge of it. I owe him more than I could ever hope to repay.
He was especially gifted when it came to Restoration. He's... Well, he's very particular about who shares the knowledge.
Hmm... yes. I guess I can see how that would add a more... earthy texture. And, oddly enough, we do have some on hand...
Hmmm. I don't think you've got enough to cover my expenses with Silver-Bloods, much less convince me give my words away.
Home? Home to me is a hot cup of ale at the end of the day and five minutes without someone needing something from me...
How could I complain when I went from Sabjorn's lackey to one of the wealthiest merchants in Whiterun in no time at all?
I admire your restraint, but there are times when you must make decisions, even without all the facts. Rely on instinct.
I am called Boethiah. Many names have mortals given me. But I am not interested in names. I am interested only in deeds.
I can't believe we lost Whiterun. The rebels have a great advantage in controlling the center now. We must take it back!
I don't much care where it came from or who sent it. What I do know is that it's made the mistake of attacking Whiterun!
I don't need your jokes right now, but maybe you have a point. Maybe Camilla needs some help seeing Sven for what he is.
I don't want a bad reputation in Riften, but Haelga's out of control. She wanted to try it in the stables so I said yes.
I don't want to hear another word about what you're learning from the elf! It's high time you learned to be a Nord, too!
I have a collection of artifacts from the group that toppled an Empire. Their importance to history cannot be forgotten.
I knew you had it in you. I daresay the Psijics are right. There's no one more deserving to be Arch-Mage, in my opinion.
I made a wish in the town well that a golden knight came to take me to his castle. Oh, does it spoil the wish if I tell?
I might have to stop and get myself a pint of Black-Briar mead while I'm in Riften. Almost worth the trip all by itself.
I never had any friends; who'd want to spend time with [QUOTE]the little weird girl who hangs around dead people?[QUOTE]
I shall teach you a spell to discern things hidden from others. With it, you will be able to acquire the texts you need.
I swear that woman is the most spiteful shrew in all Skyrim. I think there's a chunk of ice where her heart ought to be.
I think we have a nice wealthy home for you to break into. Think you can clear the place of valuables and keep it quiet?
I trained our daughter Lilija as a healer... to one day tend the Shrine of Talos and replace me as a Priestess of Talos.
I want you to speak to the city guard. Make sure there's a contingency plan in effect in case Riften falls under attack.
I warned them against such a rash action. Even I could not foresee its consequences. Nust ni hon. They would not listen.
I was a barmaid at the Winking Skeever when I met my husband, rest his soul. Wasn't for him, I'd still be working there!
I was adventuring in the depths of the ruins when I was attacked by a massive construct... like nothing I had ever seen.
I wish I could say that I did not, but in every part of Skyrim, there is talk of dragon sightings. It is no coincidence.
I'd like to make the journey to the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm and give my ceremonial dagger to Andurs, the caretaker.
I'd take this a bit more seriously if I were you. If a dragon decides to attack Whiterun I don't know if we can stop it.
I'll make sure this war ends, all right. Just as soon as the dragons swarm across Skyrim and wipe out all of you puny...
I'm a generous man, to those who treat me right. Might be I'll even let you live here with me, if you mind your manners.
I've already provided you a key to the museum. You should consider it an honor. Few are allowed to browse my collection.
I've been setting up some open trading with Tonilia back at the Guild in Riften, and it's proven to be quite profitable.
I've been wanting to say thanks for being a friend. Here. It's not much, but I was thinking you might like to have this.
I've seen this before. We need some medicines to combat the ore dust. I was about to send a message to Windhelm for aid.
If General Tullius continues to conscript our men and send them off to battle, we'll have none left to protect the city.
If this is impossible due to misuse or accident, Urag recommends finding a replacement copy to deliver to the Arcanaeum.
If you know an enchantment and have a filled soul gem, you can enchant armor and weapons. Just use the arcane enchanter.
If you stand before me to accuse me of sacrificing children, or eating the hearts of the dead, you may save your breath.
If you want to make new armor or weapons, use the forge. It takes plenty of raw materials though, such as iron or steel.
If you're here to talk politics, though, you'd want his brother Thongvor. He spends most of his time in Understone Keep.
If you're looking to settle in Riften, there's a house for sale - Honeyside. See the steward in the keep if you want it.
In any event, when Vici dies, it's going to be complete pandemonium. Best have your escape route planned out in advance.
In the time before man, they were known as the snow elves. They lived in the sunlight and had a very prosperous society.
Instant, unexplainable. The stories have fascinated me... Ever since I was young, I wanted to know what really happened.
It is up to each of us to present ourselves publicly as maturely as possible, and to remain above petty local squabbles.
It takes two things to be a good teacher. The first is patience. The second is a firm wooden stick for rapping knuckles.
It was Gallus who inducted me into the Nightingales and honed my skills to a razor sharp point. I owe everything to him.
It was only through blind luck that I was able to crawl away from the Dwemer abomination and make my way to the surface.
It wasn't enough that the College still stands, now the damnable Empire has Winterhold. I hope they all freeze to death.
It's not a simple matter. I could offend her fairly easily by bringing up the wrong subject. I've seen it happen before.
Just follow the road north. When you get to Honningbrew Meadery, turn left and the road will take you to the city gates.
Look, I've seen one of the spirits with my very own eyes. When it glared at me, I swear it burned right through my soul.
Madena, can we count on your spells to assist us in this war? The Empire is bound to bring their battlemages against us.
Many of my countrymen joined the rebels. They can't see the big picture. Skyrim needs the Empire as much as it needs us.
Must have come from Mercer's place. He'd admired the Gray Fox for some time. Sure, I'll buy it from you... here you are.
My father was a Stormcloak soldier in his younger days. Now he just walks the streets spewing his hatred and propaganda.
My friend Maven and I - have you met Maven, in Riften? - we know our place in this world. Know the place of others, too.
My goodness, it's been years since I've spoken with him. I suppose he's still down in the Midden, but I haven't checked.
My husband Aesgir and I thank you for coming to our reception. We thank you for sharing the love we have for each other.
My papa says I'm greg-gare-ree-yus, just like him! He says it means [QUOTE]smart,[QUOTE] but my brother says he's wrong.
Mystical beings who live in legends and were masters of great magic. Imagine the power that coursed through their veins!
Nivahriin joorre! What have you done? What twisted Words have you created?! Tahrodiis Paarthurnax! My teeth to his neck!
No one cares about us! No one! We could die and no one would ever even know! They'd just throw our corpses in the canal!
No, no friend. You've got it all wrong. I'm not selling cheap mead. I'm selling good mead for cheap... Black-Briar Mead.
Nonetheless, many are drawn to these stones based on the local stories describing them as a source of significant power.
Not yet, not yet. When we get to Riverwood... with Delphine... I'll tell you both then, when I've collected my thoughts.
Now I've been told that the attacker claimed to be a Forsworn. It's nonsense. More likely he was just sick in the head. 
Now that you've brought Dravin's bow back, he's back to his crabby old self. For better or for worse, I still thank you.
Now... now wait a minute. Let's not get hasty. I mean, surely my friend wouldn't want me to endanger my own life. Right?
Obviously, this treasure will fetch a good deal of gold, and I'm willing to let you share in the reward when we find it.
Oh, but Cicero can't talk to you. You've been naughty, naughty. I think you need to clear this whole mess up with Nazir.
Oh, it took years, but I earned my way to the top. I own Chillfurrow Farm, you see. Very successful business. Obviously.
Oh, no, I'm not falling for that one again. Next thing I know, I'm getting yelled at for saying something inappropriate.
Oh, stop apologizing. It makes you look like an idiot. Learn to talk back a bit, girl! Why, when I was in the temple....
Oh! Oh! Maybe Cicero will go to Jorrvaskr and dance for the Companions! They'll... Um... On second thought... maybe not.
Once Sabjorn is out of the way, Maven has plans for this place. One way or another, we don't want the pests coming back.
One day, the Forsworn will paint the walls of Markarth in your kinsmen's blood. Best you not be there on that day, Nord.
One of those things has the key to this cage. If you get me out of here I'll help you slaughter the rest of those crows.
Only the bravest are allowed to lead, and to marry. A great chief is able to attract many wives and raise bold children.
Remember, the Way of the Voice trains you for more than battle. Indeed, we believe that battle is the least of its uses.
Return now to Nirn, with this rich boon from Shor, my lord: a Shout to bring a hero from Sovngarde in your hour of need.
Scholars say the Dwemer were an advanced culture. Ha! The Nords outlasted their entire race. So much for being advanced.
So that's why you're here, Ulfric? You dare to insult the Greybeards by using this council to advance your own position?
Some of the Guild members have tried to locate them over the years, but they haven't been successful... well, until now.
Some people say they watched over the group, others say they were reserved for the most elite jobs. I don't really know.
Suit yourself. It's only of value to collectors, though. Good luck finding anyone else who will appraise it that highly!
Take a good look around. I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for. If not, let me know, I might have it stored away.
Taking an easy job, eh? Well, go and do some damage. Just stick to the shadows and keep out of sight. Want to go for it?
Thanks for taking care of that. I don't think that will be the last we see of that Orc. It's always good to gain allies.
That would be a bad idea. I'd be too likely to attract the wrong kind of attention. But they don't know you at all, yet.
That's wonderful. You've done us a great service. As promised the outfit is yours and here's something for your trouble.
The Augur is down in the Midden, below the College. I don't recommend going down there unless it's absolutely necessary.
The code is not written anywhere. It is known and carried on by the Orcs, and all who live in the strongholds follow it.
The Companions are the oldest, most honored band of warriors in Skyrim. Whiterun was built around their hall, Jorrvaskr.
The dov are children of Akatosh. Thus we are specially... attuned to the flow of Time. Perhaps also uniquely vulnerable.
The Imperials have really dug into Whiterun. We'll wrest it from them soon enough. We must. Its central position is key.
The real reason I'm speaking with a cutthroat in the bowels of this detestable crypt. For I seek the assassination of...
The ship travels the northern coast, and sometimes isn't even in Skyrim at all. So you'll have to be patient. Good luck.
The situation here at your College is of dire importance, and attempts to contact you as we have previously have failed.
There are those that believe the Jarl does nothing for this city... that it's corrupt and run by the Black-Briar family.
There should be a few basic tomes around here somewhere in case your training is even more sub-standard than I've heard.
There's a sort of tavern down there, the Ragged Flagon. Where all the lowlifes in Riften get drunk and knife each other.
There's an entrance down by the canal, but I'd highly advise you stay out of there... its the Thieves Guild's territory.
There's been talk again in the streets. A general fear that the giants may move south, and then... Well, you understand.
They invented machines and built elaborate underground cities where they researched powers to rival the gods themselves.
They thought I was some other Redguard woman! They just wouldn't leave me alone. I hope they get lost in the wilderness.
Think I'll forge me a new sword, just in case things go awry here in Solitude. I'm the blacksmith's apprentice, you see.
This brilliant soul decided to pick a fight with a fellow Guild mate. Time for them to pay the piper. Will you help out?
This is a dwarven artifact beyond nearly all value. A singular instrument of immense power, a tool of impossible import.
This is a priority now. Anything we can use to fight this dragon, or dragons. We need it, quickly. Before it's too late.
This is notorious bandit hideout. But it's also the shortest way to Kynesgrove, so... we may have to kill a few bandits.
This is why I say we take the fight to them. Gather the Legion and drive those blasted beasts out of the Reach for good.
Through neglect. During the Great War, they let the unwashed natives retake the Reach and declare their own sovereignty.
Twenty-five years ago I was standing outside these very same ruins. Gallus told me to meet here but he wouldn't say why.
We caroused together with Sam Guevenne, remember? We broke into the Temple of Dibella? How much did you end up drinking?
We want the Pale returned to Imperial control. The traitor Skald the Elder will be replaced with a more loyal candidate.
We were excavating this old tomb when we opened a chamber full of corpses. The team took one look, turned tail, and ran.
We'd be better off without the Silver-Bloods. They send their brute, Yngvar, to shake some coins from me every few days.
We're getting to the point where the tunnels are getting deep into the rock. People complain of bad coughs and foul air.
We're pleased to have her in Riften. She brings stability, opportunities for employment and strategic value to our city.
Well, it's said to be very powerful. Has the capacity to store an incredible amount of magical power, as the story goes.
Well, you got Maven, she pretty much runs the whole operation. She's got friends in high places if you know what I mean.
What I'm not so sure about is the peace we've made with the Thalmor. But we'll keep that between the two of us, alright?
What would you have me do? If we do not send men to fight in the war, you'll find yourself guarding one of Ulfric's men.
What? Why? But... you must have said something to Erikur! You lied to him and now here I am! You're a heartless monster!
What's Karliah been filling your head with? Tales of thieves with honor? Oaths rife with falsehoods and broken promises?
When you walk through the Guild, don't be ashamed to hold your head high 'cause you're the best damn thief in the place.
Will I teach you, Dovahkiin? What Word calls you to deeper understanding? There are three to master: Fus, Feim, and Yol.
With the soldiers all fighting in the war, there's nobody to hunt down the bandits. Travel has become dangerous of late.
Worse. The Khajiit Caravans are the only way to get supplies into the city, and even those are becoming more infrequent.
Yes, I know. As does Astrid. You have done well, and have earned both your reward, and a bonus, as I may have mentioned.
Yes... one of his allies could tell us. Motmahus... But it will not be so easy to... convince one of them to betray him.
You aren't going to pass. You're going to give me everything you have. Whether you leave here in one piece is up to you.
You don't invite monsters into your home to have supper! I won't have them here, and I'm certainly not smiling for them!
You listen to me. I'd be careful wagging that pretty little tongue at me like that otherwise I may just have it cut off.
You ready yet? I need to get back before I'm missed. Remember, you won't have anything except what I smuggle in for you.
You see, I happen to know after she makes love, she gives her partner a token of her affection called a Mark of Dibella.
You stand now at the precipice of the Void. I am reminded of another Listener, a protege I knew long ago. So long ago...
You... you were at Helgen. One of the prisoners. What makes you think I'm interested in someone like you for the Legion?
You'd really risk your life for a stranger's honor? I don't even know what to say. Thank you, my friend. I'll wait here.
Your lack of cooperation has been noted. We'll be back if we require further information. You won't get a second chance.
...and he says to the man, [QUOTE]That's not a horker! That's my wife![QUOTE] Ha ha ha ha ha... Ah... I love that one... 
[QUOTE]His men dressed up and then went out to fight, but they reversed Olaf's orders much to Winterhold's sorrow.[QUOTE]
A dragon... here in Skyrim. What's this world coming to? First the war, now dragons... trouble loves company, they say...
A servant? Enlisting in the Stormcloaks? Ah, Bulfrek, that's why I like having you about. You're always good for a laugh.
After the attack, Arnbjorn flew into a rage. When Cicero left... Arnbjorn went after him. They disappeared into the wild.
Ah, that feels so much better! You forget how nice supreme power feels until you've been stuck in a cave for a few years.
Ah, yes. The entrance seems to be near what's now known as the Karthspire. We'll have to see what we find when we arrive.
Although I have not practiced in a long time I was once a wizard. Even when I was young my magic was undeniably powerful.
Anuriel, would you please stop declaring that the city is safe for the Jarl to roam? You and I both know that isn't true.
Any one of us could enter that chamber silently. Unnoticed. But who amongst us would dare conspire against the Sanctuary?
Are you now? You were at Helgen, one of the prisoners. Although no one seems to know how you got mixed up in that affair.
As it turns out, I've got two new contracts. One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge.
Back to the time when a king was a king because his enemies fell before him, and his people rose because they loved him. 
Because an unfocused mind will almost certainly be obliterated. Destroyed by the forces you attempt to control and yield.
Better than nothing, I guess. But Tullius will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Riften without a fight.
Brynjolf want's this mark's head on a pike, but we'll settle for what the bastard's carryin' instead. Can I count on you?
But he's not. I just know it. The Imperials captured him, and they're holding him someplace. The Battle-Borns know where.
But I doubt many will wish to exchange Alduin's lordship for the tyranny of Paarthurnax's [QUOTE]Way of the Voice[QUOTE].
But I hear the maids, Una and Erdi, know how to enter it for cleaning. Surely they can help for such an important matter?
But the Emperor canceled his journey at the last minute. Maro was smart, kept the Gourmet around, in case things changed.
Confound it, boy, I know what I'm doing. It will help me determine the season of his burial, which I can cross-reference.
Defense? No one would dare attack Riften. I'm not sure you realize just how well connected Jarl Maven is with the Empire.
Did you know what we were attempting? Are you here to make sure your plan worked, that our efforts have been for nothing?
Don't bother me, peasant. I've had a long journey and paid too much coin on these gifts to be late to Vittoria's wedding.
Don't dismiss our adversary so easily. They're well-funded, patient and have been able to avoid identification for years.
Don't forget to check your tribute chest once in a while. As Guild Master you're getting a significant cut of the spoils.
Down at the docks. There are a few good spots, if you can avoid the East Empire Company workers and those Red Wave thugs.
Ever since I was a boy, I felt this strange sense of destiny surrounding the Mythic Dawn cult, and now I know what it is.
Ever since my parents died and Haelga took me in, it's been a nightmare. How was I to know she was such a wretched woman?
First of all, I need to sew confusion and doubt through the rebel troops. I want to assassinate their commanding officer.
Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be generously rewarded.
Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be moderately rewarded.
Get out there, shake him down and see what you come up with. Talk to Brynjolf before you leave if you have any questions.
Go ahead, hit me as often as you want. It's not going to change anything, other than to make me and the town guard angry.
Good work. Here's your gold. I have a feeling Nepos gets his own orders, though. If you find out, I'll have more for you.
Ha! I'm afraid the loot's already been moved. You've been useful to the Blackbloods, though. You've earned a quick death.
Ha. I'd like to see those arrogant bastards taken down a notch. Always looking down their noses at us lowly footsloggers.
He hired the others and paid for my goods. I am allowed to run the caravan, but I pay Ri'saad a percentage of my profits.
He said he was going east towards the border of Morrowind to trade some of our grain to some folks at Broken Helm Hollow.
He used to live here in Riften at the Orphanage on the other side of town but I think he ran away. Can't say I blame him.
He's a wood elf - the Thalmor wiped out his family back in Valenwood during one of their purges that we never hear about.
Here we are. Gods, I'm nervous. We'll go in in just a moment. Please, I'll serve. You just stand there and... be amazing.
How many of those corpses lining our streets wear the faces of men who once called you friend? What about their families?
I am here to remind the ruling classes of Skyrim that their loyalty to the Emperor requires cooperation with the Thalmor.
I can't find my Alembic. I suppose I could use another one, but... well, it sounds silly, but mine has sentimental value.
I don't dare leave this unattended. Can you return to the College and inform Savos Aren of this discovery? Please, hurry.
I doubt the blessing's effects last for very long, so ask whenever you're heading out, and I'll perform the proper rites.
I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
I guess I'm doing all right. I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun.
I have a few very detailed missives from border patrols, beginning with Fifth Irregulars' reports on the movements of....
I haven't seen so much celebrating in years. Mercer's dead, we have a new Guild Master and things are finally looking up.
I joined the Legion to see the world. I know, that's one of those things people say, but it's completely true in my case.
I knew we could count on you. Get it taken care of right away. Nobody wants an animal left roaming around in their place.
I know the area of the Reach that Esbern's talking about. Near what's now known as Karthspire, in the Karth River canyon.
I remember you... You were with us at Helgen... I heard you came around and picked the right side. Welcome to the Legion!
I shouldn't have believed the story and just refused the trade. But I didn't, and now I'm stuck with this worthless junk.
I staggered away from the ruins and my vision began to blur. It's then that I realized the bitch had poisoned her arrows.
I suspect that the power released by the Eye of Magnus was not fully contained, and has coalesced in this part of Skyrim.
I think you may have joined up with the wrong side, Dragonborn. You showed yourself a true daughter of Skyrim here today.
I think... I think he meant this for you, then. I'm not sure why, but there was something very personal about it for him.
I was ready to pack my things when Hermir came to me. She wanted to make sure I'd finish teaching her the smithing trade.
I wasn't aware that Lisbet was having trouble, Cosnach. Is Arnleif and Sons not doing a good turn of business these days?
I... you're right of course. It can be hard to hear the winds of Kynareth when all you hear are the rabble in the temple.
I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now would we?
I'm all for diplomacy, but the sooner the Emperor deals with this civil war mess, the sooner we can get back to Cyrodiil.
I'm watching you, Maven Black-Briar. One day, you'll slip up and your Imperial friends won't be there to catch your fall.
I've had to be careful handling those blade shards you found. They're each sharp enough to sever a finger with no effort.
I've heard you Gray-Manes are collaborating with the Stormcloaks. If I see any such treachery, I'll deal with you myself.
If he hadn't signed the peace treaty with the Thalmor, they would have destroyed the Empire - then where would Skyrim be?
If I had a Septim for every case of Rockjoint or Witbane I've cured since I opened this shop, I'd be a rich woman indeed.
If I'm right Svaknir and King Olaf's Verse lie in Dead Men's Respite, along with the burial chamber of King Olaf himself.
If this continues, and the worst comes to pass, Solitude will pay the price. The Empire is headquartered here, after all.
If trying to rid yourself of stolen goods becomes a burden, and you find yourself in Winterhold, visit me at the College.
If you're looking to pass the time, you can give Calixto a few septims and gawk at whater oddity he's come across lately.
In Rimerock Burrow, there's an artifact called the Rueful Axe. Bring it to me, and I'll take Barbas back. Simple as that.
Indeed, many in the Order believe it has already... Rather, something will happen soon, something that cannot be avoided.
Ingun, you clumsy fool! You've tainted our entire supply of Painted Troll Fat. You have no idea how hard that was to get.
Is it true what they say? There was a dragon held captive in Whiterun, and you... you released it? By the gods, man, why?
It takes half a day just to dig a planting row in the cold, stony earth here. But what else can we do, eat rocks and ice?
It was lit one hundred and sixty-three years ago, back when this building was the home of a grand warrior named Vundheim.
It's a great big festival put on by the bards, every year. They burn an effigy of old King Olaf. It's quite a bit of fun.
It's not far. We used to go to the market there every month or so, until the roads got so dangerous with the war and all.
It's probably more trouble to pack up and leave than it is to stay. Besides, Ambarys can't run the cornerclub on his own.
J'zargo can learn magic from these men and elves, but they cannot learn to be as dashing as he. J'zargo comes out on top.
Just one. I know when I was found by my Argonian father, I was wrapped in a blanket bearing the symbol of House Telvanni.
Kodlak is the Harbinger, and he's a sort of advisor for the whole group, but every man is his own. Every woman, her own. 
Listen you impudent cur. According to my scrying something happened at Wolfskull Cave that returned Potema to this world.
Look, it was one night, okay? I think she slipped something in my drink. I haven't even been back to the Bunkhouse since.
Lucan found the claw about a year after he opened the store. He never quite explained where he got it. He's a tricky one.
My uncle Dengeir was Jarl until a short time ago. His old age and failing health caught up with him, and he stepped down.
Never mind that. Madena is a good woman, but I have my own reasons for opening this museum, and I'm not changing my mind.
No. Although it's true my husband Torygg was the High King and I am his widow, I am in no position to claim such a title.
None of these people cares a whit about the religious aspects of this war. Another sign of the degeneracy of your Empire.
Now that our [QUOTE]ghost[QUOTE] has been unmasked, I hope we see more visitors in town than just the occasional pilgrim.
Now, you'd better get a move on and see Astrid. It's time! Time for the final stage of this grand and glorious operation.
Now, your life as a Nightingale begins. Should the need arise, you'll be summoned to the Sepulcher in order to defend it.
Of course, there's another story of Lenne losing the family shield in a different cave, so it depends on who you believe.
Oh I get it. [QUOTE]It's missing so Grelka must have it.[QUOTE] I wish this town would stop pointing their fingers at me.
Oh, I know it! You keep working hard, like you been doing, and you could be the greatest blacksmith Skyrim has ever seen.
Once again, you have underestimated me. You see the man, brutish and hulking. But I am wolf as well. Deliberate. Cunning.
Once things settle down, I'll be lookin' to recruit more guards for the city, then shore up our stores of food an' water.
One day, I will have a son who will challenge me when I become too old to lead, and the stronghold will have a new chief.
One moment, I know, time is of the essence, but mustn't leave secrets for the Thalmor... there's one more I must bring...
Ooooh...yes...yes. You've fallen for my trap! Greed makes a great lure. Odd you didn't die from the fall though. Most do.
Patience, my dear. The Akaviri were not a straightforward people. Everything is couched in allegory and mythic symbolism.
Perhaps dating to just after the Dragon War. If so, I could use this to cross-reference the names with other later texts.
Right. Good thing they've already let you into their little cult. Not likely they'd help Esbern or me if we came calling.
Seeing the sorry state of this city almost makes me regret my decision to leave my home when my apprenticeship completed.
So you'll need his approval first. Go on, go talk to him. I'm sure he's been paying attention, and will be expecting you.
Someone else. Unseen. Unknown. Found the heart, and with a flair for the ironical, used Dwarven trickery to lock it away.
Tell Delvin that he has my support and all the weight it carries in Whiterun from now on. I think he'll be quite pleased.
Ten of them should be enough for me to get a better understanding of how they were crafted. That's all I need, all right?
Thanks to you, the people of Skyrim will continue to have a place to study magic. Even if most of them resent you for it.
That woman wielded fear like a cleaver. Or did she wield a cleaver and make people afraid? I never get that part right...
The dragons and the war have scared many other traders away, but for those with courage, there is much profit to be made.
The Dwemer who built this place were sometimes called Dwarves, but history records that they were no shorter than humans.
The Emperor's cousin Vittoria Vici is getting married soon. The reception will be public - anyone in Solitude can attend.
The gods have granted us peace for the moment. But that won't last long. I'm sure trouble will be stirred up soon enough.
The Jarl of Falkreath will view that as a provocation! He'll assume we're preparing to join Ulfric's side and attack him.
The Miasma was created by the priests of Vaermina for their rituals. It's a gas that places the affected in a deep sleep.
The so-called prison in Riften leaks like one of their fishnets. This is what happens when you let thieves run your town.
The stores are running low. We'll need to water down the milk again. Besides, don't want the little darlings getting fat.
There are cities so ancient, the sands have swallowed them whole. But now I will say no more, for I miss my home greatly.
There have been whispers. A boy, up in Windhelm, name of Aventus Aretino. Been trying to contact... the Dark Brotherhood.
There was a bit of talk about some staff you had in safe keeping. Never said where, but you sure didn't have it with you!
They claim to be fighting for Skyrim's freedom, but the war is really all about Ulfric wanting to be High King of Skyrim.
They're only allowed on the city docks now. Most of them sleep together in one building, and they're as poor as wretches.
This is the greatest honor a Nightingale can possibly achieve. In death, he's become a part of that which we use to live.
This shrine was built by the Dunmer. As our land was scorched by fire and brimstone, Azura's prophecies led us to safety.
Want to hear a little Nord wisdom? You don't really know a woman 'til you've had a strong drink and a fistfight with her.
Wasn't surprising he stayed loyal to the Empire. His father helped capture Ulfric Stormcloak after the Markarth Incident.
We were sure we'd find it all here, hidden away from time. Power, knowledge... All the things we didn't want to wait for.
We're headed to Korvanjund. But, if old King Borgas is indeed buried there, we're bound to run into trouble of some kind.
We're not done talking. You fell for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers - didn't you? I won't let her have you!
Well, it never arrived. Later I found out that it was robbed by a group of bandits led by someone named Rigel Strong-Arm.
Well. I trust you have something vitally important to tell me. Important enough to interrupt me in the middle of council?
What about you, Elisif? Are these terms to your liking? Speak up. I'm sure General Tullius is waiting to do your bidding.
What you fail to realize is your actions were expected and represent nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement.
When finally set free, I returned to Windhelm, and was greeted by a city in mourning, at one with my own grief and anger.
When I told you the set had to be complete, I left out a small detail... I honestly didn't think you'd ever get this far.
While Drevis appreciates the spellcasting skill that went into somehow cramming several hundred apples into his pillow...
Whole dwarven city underneath the keep. Nchuand-Zel. Best steer clear if you don't want a Steam Centurion carving you up.
With my husband's new found religion, what I do with our coin and what I do all day seem less important to him. Suits me.
Yes, sir. I've been trying to quiet her, but she's insistent. She thinks she can find out who's been killing the women...
You ask why I'm so fascinated? The irony... the irony that the same world that gave us life provides us the means to die.
You could get some useful information about whatever they were up to. Sounds like it won't be of use to them now, anyway.
You get around, right? If you come across any Stormcloaks... gut one for me. They did the same to my brother in Whiterun.
You have a problem with that? Go talk to him. You'll find him in front of the ruins during the day. Just down the tunnel.
You have a problem wth that? Take it up with Madanach. I'm sure the King in Rags and his Forsworn would love to meet you.
You have something at your College, don't you? Something immensely powerful. Beyond anything I'd anticipated. What is it?
You know, things are really starting to move around here. I mean, look at the place. I've never seen so much merchandise.
You may think so. But in the end, you mortals will always flit like fire with the winds of your desires and conveniences.
You need to start pulling your own weight around here, otherwise I might [QUOTE]forget[QUOTE] to offer you any more jobs.
You see, when the stories of dragons began to circulate, many dismissed them as mere fantasies, rumors. Impossiblilities.
You shall have no Shield-Brother this time. But the spirit of Ysgramor goes with you, to restore the honor of his legacy.
You surrender Hjaalmarch to us, and take Idgrod Ravencrone with you. Sorli the Builder will take over as Jarl of Morthal.
You want to walk away? Fine. But there's going to be no justice for that poor woman. No one to care what happened to her.
You, my friend. You've slain their leader. This honor should be yours. Do this, and you will be rewarded most handsomely!
You'll never defeat the Empire, and you know it. But you're willing to sacrifice thousands for your own selfish ambition.
You're alive! It was a gamble - but as Talos keeps us, we keep each other - I wasn't going to just let them rot in there.
You've done a larger service to the realm than you could possibly know. A resurrected Potema... I shudder at the thought.
Your guy's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens and paying us good coin for nobody to know about it. Well, until now that is.
[QUOTE]Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead! Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed![QUOTE]
A few days ago, some thieves from Riften broke in here and stole it! Can you imagine? Took the only thing of value we had.
A lack of ambition like that really ought to be punished. Perhaps by turning you into a worm, or maybe a few decades of...
Ain't sure if they're takin' on new members, but you should talk to the Companions. They're over in their hall, Jorrvaskr.
All you'll accomplish by threatening them is ending up in the Riften dungeon. You're lucky they didn't take you seriously.
And besides myself, Delvin, Niruin and Vipir can help you with any sort of training you might need to sharpen your skills.
And so in death, too late, I learn the truth - fed by war, so waxed the power of Alduin, World-Eater - wisdom now useless.
And that's why I won't rest easy until every single Imperial soldier joins her, and Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim.
Are we alone? Yes... yes... alone. Sweet solitude. No one will hear us, disturb us. Everything is going according to plan.
As the Jarl of Riften, I feel it's my duty to honor your selfless behavior by honoring you with the title Thane of Riften.
Aye, but I'll be here in Solitude for longer still. Fihada's skill as a fletcher drew me to this place. I wanted to learn.
Balgruuf was an even-tempered man, but his brother's a hot-blooded war-monger who wants to settle everything with a blade.
But I believe the Scroll's bond with the Tiid-Ahraan will allow you a... a seeing, a vision of the moment of its creation.
But if you mean me, now, in particular... maybe they've started to get an inkling of what the return of the dragons means.
By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Kin to the Orcs. Let it be known among the strongholds that you are family, now.
Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches.
Don't mistake my political beliefs as a substitute for my family values. They're still my parents, and I love them dearly.
Don't worry about Nelacar. He has a permanent room here at the Inn, but he keeps to himself and doesn't cause any trouble.
Everyone looked and no one could find her. Wilhelm said she'll be back... told Narfi not to worry... Reyda will come back.
Four of the guards have already decided they're in love with me. Two of the guards got into a fight over me at the tavern.
Have you heard of Blackreach? [QUOTE]Cast upon where Dwemer cities slept, the yearning spire hidden learnings kept.[QUOTE]
He demands loyalty and strength from his orcs. We have tried to please him, but he is now angry with us, and so we suffer.
He is the pus in the wound. Oh, proper ones curl their noses, but it's pus that drinks foul humors and restores the blood.
He is weak, and so our tribe is weak. The giants sense this, and intrude on our territory. Now they assault our very home.
He let Ulfric Stormcloak escape Solitude. Ulfric rides in, murders the High King and Roggvir lets him ride right back out.
He made most of the arrangements himself, he just needed it transported from Morrowind. That's what I agreed to help with.
He said [QUOTE]Gwilin, you have the whole world before you. Go out and experience it... be whatever you want to be.[QUOTE]
He shot an arrow that pierced my... well, my rump. After such a memorable adventure, we knew we had the name for our shop.
Heh. Ulfric's put me in charge of keeping an eye on the new Jarls. You know, make sure they're generally following orders.
Here you go. Oh, and keep it quiet. This stuff isn't exactly easy to get a hold of at these prices, if you catch my drift.
Here, my friend. A few septims, to show my thanks, hmm? And may that twisted little jester rot in a cell for a fortnight! 
Hroar's crying is keeping me up at night. I'll give you one chance to talk the tears out of him, or he's getting the belt.
I admit, I'm surprised to see you here. Normally these parties are reserved for  the Jarls and business leaders of Skyrim.
I also lack Sunder, the counterpart to the dagger Keening. I am reasonably, confident, however, that this will still work.
I beg of you, can you bring me Troll Fat and a Daedra Heart? I have no wish to depend on a stranger, but I have no choice.
I don't care what's going on in the world. Rebellion. Dragons awakening. The mill is enough trouble for me to worry about.
I don't mean to do this to myself, but I can't help it. I tried some skooma a year ago, and ever since then, I can't stop!
I don't... I know they always disapproved of what I wanted in life, to learn magic instead becoming a farmer, or a hunter.
I have a couple of Ranmir's things that he traded to us back when he was still paying regularly. I say you've earned them.
I know it's a bit strange. Not exactly a name to bring comfort to the sick and ailing who come to buy a poultice or salve.
I think one of them came back. Nelacar. Stays at the Frozen Hearth, but I don't know why. He's not welcome in the College.
I think the Jarl should hear about this. Maybe double his taxes. No, triple them. That should teach those people a lesson.
I think you're all right. In fact, I'm kind of impressed how well you're doing around here. Just keep it between us, okay?
I was hoping you would to take something of his, a warhorn handed down from his father, and place it at a Shrine of Talos.
I'll tell you about the time I was a young girl, barely out of her teens... living on a pig farm in the middle of nowhere.
I'm a woman living in Skyrim with six children and no husband. I don't have the time or patience to be [QUOTE]nice.[QUOTE]
I'm concerned that when this place is unsealed, the Miasma will dissipate and they'll awaken; both orcs and priests alike.
I'm sorry you feel my illegal contraband is overpriced, perhaps you should bring it up at the next merchant guild meeting.
I've been to Ivarstead a few times, but never climbed High Hrothgar. I wouldn't mind visiting the monastery at the summit.
I've got a good feeling about you. And I don't often get good feelings about anything. A warrior knows to trust her gut...
I've never liked having the rebels right on Solitude's doorstep. Retaking Hjaalmarch would help secure our supply lines...
I've only been a part of the Red Wave's crew for a few weeks, but I've already learned to stay out of Captain Safia's way.
I've spent years watching his techniques and learning his tricks. Sadly, I don't think I'll ever be as talented as he was.
In appreciation for your exemplary service, I am doubling your pay and compensation to the widows of your fallen comrades.
It is my personal mission to ensure that the Bards College preserves the great deeds of the past, in both poetry and song.
It was my pleasure, Torbjorn. I enjoy cooking, and after what you and Tova have been through, it was the least I could do.
It's a matter of time before the Jarl is coming to me asking for money. This mine is going to make me... I  mean us, rich.
It's a school that teaches music, poetry, that sort of thing. Most bards in Skyrim have been to the college at some point.
It's a smart man that demands something up front for his work. Some gold now and some when I have my dog. Here's the meat.
It's not easy being a woman in Skyrim, I know. But stay strong, and men will come to respect you, and maybe even fear you.
Jarl Balgruuf still hasn't declared for one side or the other, so at least you won't run into any Imperials along the way.
Just that, I'm afraid. You lack the ability, in any school of magic, to contribute meaningfully to the College's research.
Life in Morthal has been troubled lately. The people are uncertain, restless. They merely look to the Jarl for leadership.
Listen to your inner Voice before acting. Do not allow the Blades to bully you into doing something you will later regret.
Look, if you're heading towards Dawnstar anytime soon, can you give the Jarl this note? Let him know he'll get his lumber.
Mercer may have damaged our reputation and raided our coffers, but this goes well beyond even his twisted form of larceny.
My guards told me. Poor Margret. And witnesses report that the attacker was shouting some nonsense about being a Forsworn.
My husband Eorlund tends the Skyforge up at Jorrvaskr, the Companions mead hall. There's no finer smith in the nine holds.
My mistake. A manservant wouldn't let me starve or freeze. I let you live here, and now I'm two steps closer to the grave.
No, this was a specific one. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.
Now having an Orc for a wife would be something, yes. Strong and bulky. Too bad they don't let people go beyond the walls.
Of course I'm troubled. I'm on the verge of incredible wealth, but my cowardly work force ran at the first sign of danger.
Of course, my dear. Of course. You all certainly possess some inherent natural ability. That much is not being questioned.
Off the coast a ways to the east, you'll find the wreck of the Brinehammer. Never know what treasures may still be aboard.
Oh come off it, Niv. We both know you married that fisherman for his gold. You don't need to put on an act for my benefit.
Oh, and don't mind my assistant here. He may have seen better days, but he's still more help to me dead than he was alive.
Oh, and there's a nasty feud between two families called the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns. You'll want to be careful there.
Oh, I'm not a Companion, myself. I just help Vignar. He took me in when I was having a tough time, and... well, I owe him.
Oh, it doesn't matter now. Gavros is never coming back, and he was supposed to have the crystal. Without that, we're lost.
Oh... Well... yes. I did. I did indeed. I tried to listen. Tried so hard. But the Night Mother never spoke to poor Cicero.
Okay, here's how this works. You try to assassinate me, and I kill you. Horribly. I have done this dance before, you know.
On his deathbed, my master urged me to take over his business but I decided against it. I chose to wander Tamriel instead.
One, I'm the best infiltrator this rathole of a Guild's got, so if you think you're here to replace me, you're dead wrong.
Paying the wages yourself? Well, I won't say no to gold. By my family's honor, this money will go to the Argonian workers.
Reburrus, there is a war being fought across all of Skyrim, and you bother me with the usual mundane reports about silver?
See what you can figure out auxillary, I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something.
She sold the city out to the Aldmeri Dominion. Were it not for her betrayal, Taneth could have held its ground in the war.
Since I know losing the farm's payments will harm the Guild, I intend to make a substantial contribution for compensation.
So... now that I've whetted your appetite with our little scheme at the market, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?
Thank you for your help. I'm going to stay in the tomb for a while. My shame kept me out before, but now I want to see it.
Thank you yet again. I will make sure our applicant, who was instrumental in... recovering the poem will be well rewarded.
That amulet. I've seen the Nords wear these when they're looking to marry. With your strength, you should have no trouble.
That is [QUOTE]Fus.[QUOTE] Let its meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You will push the world harder than it pushes back.
That would be Skald the Elder. He's been running Dawnstar ever since he was a boy, and he never lost that brat's attitude.
The cave has a bad history. Long ago, Potema the Wolf Queen used it for necromantic rituals. That's where it got the name.
The dark elves are too proud and naive to understand the way things truly are, and so they continue to dwell in that slum.
The Empire had captured Ulfric. The war was basically over. Then a dragon attacks, Ulfric escapes, and the war is back on.
The Empire showed its true colors today, eh? Don't worry. I was once loyal to the Empire, too, before my eyes were opened.
The Greybeards are masters of the Way of the Voice. If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift.
The headmistress is an evil, cruel woman. They call her Grelod the Kind. But she's not kind. She's terrible. To all of us.
The rest you can find out by asking the townsfolk. I'd start with the barkeep at the Bannered Mare, or the castle steward.
The Synod seemed convinced it was somewhere in Skyrim. They inquired about the ruins of Mzulft, but that's all I remember.
The Thalmor take the arrogance of high elves to the extreme - they believe they are the rightful rulers of all of Tamriel.
Their spies must've found out we know about the Crown, and they don't want us to have it. But they won't stand in our way.
There is an empty home in the city, but there was some... unpleasantness recently. I'm afraid it's not available just yet.
There's an inn at Kynesgrove - the Braidwood. I hear they serve a nice dark ale. Nothing on the Sleeping Giant, of course.
There's no refusing a summons from the Greybeards. If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your power.
These matters are becoming more difficult to deal with. I'm going to need 1000 gold from you in order to make reparations.
They make it difficult for decent people to earn a living. Of course, not many decent people live here in the first place.
They put on airs like they're somethin' special. Sure, they've got money, but they ain't got a shred of honor between 'em.
Think about the Guild... about the state it was in when you began. Think about all the little things you might have heard.
Think of this as the fire builds in your su'um, in your breath. Su'um ahrk morah. What will you burn? What will you spare?
Thinks his ballads and sonnets are going to convince Camilla Valerius to marry him. As if she would say [QUOTE]yes.[QUOTE]
This betrayal made them what they are now... horrible blind monstrosities with a burning hatred of any but their own kind.
Through the Protocol, we have seen the home of the next Sybil, to the north, in a small village pressed against the stone.
Times have been good and bad since then, but some folks couldn't handle not ruling their own land. Those are the Forsworn.
Wait, wait. I can see a minor problem in your theory. Without a soul siphon, how would you prevent permanent magicka burn?
We are not warriors. What is overlooked in the Dragonborn is not permitted to any other followers of the Way of the Voice.
We need to find out if the Thalmor are behind the dragons coming back. We need to get into the Thalmor Embassy, somehow...
We need you to teach him a lesson by burning down three of the estate's hives and clearing out the safe in the main house.
We therefore seek to guide you on the proper use of your gift, which transcends the restrictions which bind other mortals.
We want to waylay a shipment on the way from this business without them even noticin' anything went missin'. Want the job?
We're passing Fort Sungard. Unbelievable view from up there. No wonder the Empire built a fort on that hill way back when.
What I need is my Dwemer Stirring Spoon, my Orichalcum Ingot and my Grand Soul Gem. In fact, I could use them immediately.
When it was over, Atmah, Hafnar and I stared, pale-faced, at one another, unwilling to admit we'd made a terrible mistake.
When we destroy the rebellion, perhaps the Thalmor will call off their damned inquisitions. It's just making things worse.
Why Jon Battle-Born. You're writing me a song? Does it somehow involve blood, or beheadings, or the honor of my forebears?
With Eorlund gone, I'm afraid I can't offer you much in the way of thanks. But please, take this. It's the least I can do.
With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, the Imperial Legion will need to begin its preparations immediately.
Yes, err, apologies for the intrusion. I was wondering, err, if you could possibly, ah, procure a few select items for me.
Yes. But understand - during the days of Alduin's rule, all dragons were his allies. There was nothing else they could be.
Yes. Do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting.
Yes. We're very old enemies. And if my suspicions are correct, they might have something to do with the dragons returning.
You can get a room at the Bee and Barb, but mind your coin purse -- it's no secret the Thieves' Guild makes its home here.
You did the best you could, sister. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point.
You did what was necessary. Alduin had flown far from the path of right action in his pahlok - the arrogance of his power.
You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation to this council, despite your known association with the rebels.
You have all helped make this a truly extraordinary wedding. All of my dreams have come true. So thank you. Thank you all.
You know, you should go to Windhelm and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today.
You mean you won't forget about me the moment I'm out of sight? Get yourself a nice old rich husband, have sixteen babies?
You should come to Windhelm with me and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today.
You shouldn't leave weapons laying around. Someone could get hurt. And if I see you do it again, that someone will be you.
You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.
You'd do that? If you find one, I could teach you a thing or two about trading. Help you get a fair bargain in the future.
You'll need to be careful with this one. The Jarl's men won't look kindly on you rummaging through the steward's quarters.
You've done excellent work here. Truly excellent. There's only one thing missing now, and that should be arriving shortly.
You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. So there's that. And Anton Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good.
Your continuing aid to Septimus renders him increasingly obsolete. He has served me well, but his time is nearing its end.
A few decades ago, this place was as busy as the Imperial City. Now, you're lucky if you don't trip over a skeever instead.
A good friend of mine was infected by a vampire long ago. He killed himself rather than change into one of those... things.
A good house. You chose well. I don't like sitting still, so I've decided to open a store. Buy and sell whatever is needed.
A panoply of their brethren could gather to form a facsimile. A trick. Something they didn't anticipate, no, not even them.
Ah, I see now. That would give the Potage le Magnifique a slightly metallic - but delicious - aftertaste. Simply brilliant.
All you need to do is find something to wake our poor Pelagius up. You'll find his terrors easy to repel... but persistent.
And the excavations into Nchuand-Zel are dangerous. Dwemer machines and traps still function even after thousands of years.
And we will lose customers. Let us hope that if there are dragons, there are only a few and they are not too foul-tempered.
Apologies accepted. I understand how this entire story can be mistaken for fiction since the circumstances are so abstract.
Apparently, the Red Wave has been docked in Solitude for well over a month, and with no sign of shipping out any time soon.
As for me, I kept from you only what you were not yet ready to know. Are still not ready to know, as your question reveals.
At times. Jaree-Ra stopped by the other day. Told me to keep an eye out for him, see if any new people arrived in the city.
Because they don't care about you or I, cub. They think they're better than all of us, and that we can just be thrown away.
Bolgeir's loyal, but even he doesn't do what I ask. Case in point, this whole assassin thing. Well at least I have you now.
But beware - the Empire's loyalty is fickle. They will tire of this war, and then I will be the one dictating terms to you.
But Ulfric will not stop here. No, he will continue to strike out against any true Nord who remains faithful to the Empire.
Check with Urag gro-Shub in the Arcanaeum. See if he's aware of any references to this... thing that you and Tolfdir found.
Crime is at an all-time high in this city thanks to the Thieves Guild. Don't we have enough problems with the war going on?
Easy. Maybe I was being too harsh on them. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, they will be paid fairly. You have my word.
Even if all you've said here is lies, I know you have something in Winterhold the Synod Council will be very interested in.
Even if one of these pictures tells us where the Crown is, I'm betting we're going to have to find a way through that door.
Events now spiral quickly towards the inevitable center, so you must act with haste. Take this knowledge to your Arch-Mage.
First off, there's a band of Imperials hiding in a nearby village. We're going to flush them out and put them to the sword.
First, we have information regarding the movements of a rebel courier. We need to intercept him and confiscate his package.
Fool! Don't you get it? I live in the shadow of death every day. A knife in every doorway, a nocked arrow on every rooftop!
Getting the real sword would be even better than making a copy, but no one wants to risk getting it from its resting place.
Go there now. Observe Gaius Maro's departure, and follow him. Waylay him in one of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis.
Go to Bleak Falls Barrow, find this tablet - no doubt interred in the main chamber - and bring it to me. Simplicity itself.
Got a good one here involving a shop, a waylaid shipment of goods and an angry client. You fill in the blanks. You want in?
Ha! And neither are you, eh? Good to see another Redguard. I like to think we bring a little heat to this frozen wasteland.
Ha. A few years ago, I said almost the same thing to a colleague of mine. Well, it turned out he was right and I was wrong.
Have you learned nothing from us? Would you simply be a tool in the hands of the Blades, to be used for their own purposes?
Have you seen Mirabelle around? I know she's dead, but I thought... Well, I thought she might stop in and say hello anyway.
Haven't you been paying attention to anything I've said? Only you can finally defeat Alduin and avert the end of the world!
He came nosing around Riften a while back, making a lot of noise about me. He was... persuaded to leave before he found me.
He never succeeded in getting much support, so a few months ago he murdered the High King! That got the Empire's attention.
He said I stole something! Me! Poor Cicero. A common thief. The very thought is insulting. One might even say... maddening.
He's an Argonian layabout, likes to scavenge shipwrecks. My guess is he'll run if threatened. Or swim, if given the chance.
Head over there, unless you feel like helping my wife pick crops. And then 50 years later you'll wake up and still be here.
Here you are. Now make sure you give out every single one, we can't afford to let even one lost soul stray from Her warmth.
His father was a good friend of the Guild back in the day, and we could really use his family's influence back on our side.
However, the owner has suddenly decided to take matters into his own hands and shut us out. He needs to be taught a lesson.
Hrongar carries on the policies of his brother and refuses to acknowledge the Legions right to garrison troops in his city.
I also would like to get a handle on what the rebels are planning - slip into their headquarters and steal their war plans.
I am an artisan, painting in strokes of blood red upon the canvas of life. But yes, I will take coin to fight at your side.
I am not the person that the people of Whiterun think I am. My real name is Iman. I am a noble of House Suda in Hammerfell.
I can't understand why Jorn would want to join the Imperial Legion. Soldiers only appreciate one thing, and it isn't music.
I challenged him in the traditional way, and he accepted. There were many witnesses. No [QUOTE]murder[QUOTE] was committed.
I daresay, the work I'm offering has more significance than anything your organization has experienced in, well, centuries.
I don't know how you got it back, and I don't want to know. Frankly, I don't even care... I'm just so glad to see it again.
I don't know where you find your sources, but that last shipment of skooma was some of the best quality I've seen in years.
I don't see the Arch-Mage. He must've been blown clear. I need you to find him immediately, all right? Make sure he's safe.
I envy you. Facing such a beast in combat. Smelling its blood on the air. That is what songs are sung about, Shield-Sister.
I hear Mara has sent one of her priests to the inn to try to calm people down, but I don't know how much words will do now.
I knew when we were married, this would come between us one day. I don't want to lose what we have, so I'll pay him gladly.
I never thought they would actually let me join the Companions. But now it looks like they're letting anyone in these days.
I obviously don't have anything here, but... there's a hidden stash in the Lodge. And I did manage to hold on to the key...
I run the meat and produce stand at the market. Come by and see me if you want some of the freshest food you've ever eaten.
I see... Well, the Legion will still be here when you change your mind. Rikke believes in you. And I'm starting to see why.
I spend every day tending the fields, and what do my daughters do? Nothing! Complain and caterwaul! Sleep and eat! Useless!
I think you'll find that the Guild is beginnin' to grow. We've had a merchant move into the space right outside the Flagon.
I used to live in Valenwood working at my father's winery... we made the finest wine to ever cross your lips I promise you.
I want you to talk to Sibbi for me. Then, I want you to bring me Frost and the Lineage Papers that prove the horse's worth.
I was raised in the woods. Hunting every animal I could see, with my father. I know them all as well as I know my own mind.
I'd much rather earn a living liberating others of their coin this way than spending my days as a carpenter like my father.
I'll carry the stew pot, and lead the way up to the dining room. I'm sure the Emperor and his guests are dying to meet you.
I'll tell you what we do. We spit in that curse's face and turn things around down here. Put things back the way they were.
I'm sure you can understand how useful that would prove in a business situation, especially where signatures were involved.
I'm walking the 7,000 Steps to honor the Greybeards and reflect on my own life. It's a tradition among the Nords of Skyrim.
I've been a fool, wasting my time sitting here helpless when I could have sent help sooner. Perhaps this is all my doing...
I've been at this game a long time, my friend. A long time. I've stolen trinkets from nobles and framed priests for murder.
I've come to rely on you. There's something I want you to have. It was my father's. It would be my honor if you carried it.
I've done horrible things living here, but never taken an innocent life. I couldn't just find some person for them to kill.
I've heard rumors of the resting place of the Helm of Winterhold, the very same helm that Jarl Hanse wore in the First Era.
I've never seen anyone with skills like yours. I just wanted to let you know that if you need anything, you can talk to me.
If Gavros is gone, there's no hope. He was supposed to return with the crystal... Without that, all our efforts are wasted.
If you don't mind me saying so, Ahlam, your husband is a damn fool. Any moment spent thinking about him is a moment wasted.
If you head straight west from where the White River splits towards Whiterun, you can get a look at the Cradlecrush giants.
If you think we'll just hand over Riften, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor.
If you want to sharpen your blade, use the grindstone. Although you'll need the right raw materials, such as iron or steel.
If you wish to make a donation to her Benevolence, speak to Maramal and ensure your true love will endure for all eternity.
In there! Through the door. Some old Sanctuary, by the looks of it. I would have followed him, but I don't know the phrase.
Indirectly. The Trinity is usually selected from the ranks of the Guild although its existence is a closely-guarded secret.
Is it true what they say? There was a dragon held captive in Whiterun, and you... you released it? By the gods, woman, why?
It was during the war with the Empire that I was at the height of my power. As a Thalmor battlemage I laid waste the enemy.
It'd be my honor should you decide to make Whiterun your home. Speak with Proventus. He'll make the necessary arrangements.
It's going to happen soon, I just know it. We'll strike something better than iron. Silver, or maybe even gold. You'll see.
It's not about the money, really. I wouldn't have given you the wedding ring on credit if you weren't so obviously in love.
Keerava has some family at a farm just inside of Morrowind. If you mention you know about it, she might just listen to you.
Keerava, certainly we can come to some sort of an understanding. These people must be made aware of the chaos they've sown.
Kodlak says not to worry about it. I worry that a bunch of snowberries are out there earning glory while we stay out of it.
Let them come! I have no fear, for Talos is my ally and I am his prophet. His word is upon my lips, his voice in my throat.
Let's see. Ah, so that's what happened to Staubin. Tragic, but I warned him he was leading those people on a fool's errand.
Listen, lad. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer... the leadership of the Guild.
Look, the Dark Brotherhood is a family. This Sanctuary is a family. And, we've always welcomed those... shunned by society.
Look. I gave you a contract, and you completed it. Barely. Now let's go back to you being insufferable, and me being... me.
Make sure you take the Auxiliary here. You can send her back when you get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.
Make sure you take the Auxiliary here. You can send him back when you get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.
Many battles have been fought here over the centuries. Graves were dug and monuments built, and the town grew around these.
My name is Fultheim. I'm a soldier. Well, mercenary, really. You know, a... a sellsword. I've lived in Skyrim all my life. 
My nephew, the Emperor. Too busy to attend the wedding of his beloved cousin. We won't stand for this slight, I assure you.
Nah, just creep in and have a go at taking it out. I'll be here, and pay you half of what my man in Riften promised for it.
No, my friend. That would be reckless. We have to help, but help in a way that doesn't directly place anyone in harm's way.
No. I'll tell you, Wilhelm, if I could sweep her away from here tomorrow I'd do it, but Klimmek still has so much to learn.
Nothing anybody I know would wear. Maybe ask one of the Dark Elves, they usually have some kind of rag falling off of them.
Now I'll show you to your quarters. You're going to be sharing space with your fellow Apprentices, who you'll meet shortly.
Of course, it's a group of wizards they're pointing their fingers at. Who knows what they want it for, but we want it back.
Perhaps I couldn't bring Mercer back alive, but together, we were able to clear my name and to put Gallus's memory to rest.
Poor Cicero is stuck. Can't you see? I was transporting my dear, sweet mother. Well, not her. Her corpse! She's quite dead.
Quite simple really, I don't know what the fuss is about these locks. All it takes is a bit of know-how and a lot of skill.
Say what you will about the dark elves, but they did a proper job with Azura's Shrine. Can see it for miles on a clear day.
See what you can figure out, Unblooded. I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something.
Shagrol, once the leader of this tribe, unhappy with his demise, has dealt with Malacath himself to curse me, curse us all.
Simple... I'm going to cause a distraction and you're going to steal Madesi's silver ring from a strongbox under his stand.
Some fool is opening a museum in Dawnstar. They say he's paying people to collect artifacts from that old Mythic Dawn cult.
Someone has to keep the silver production running, Betrid, and that means keeping Mulush and Nepos in line once in a while.
Something told me I wouldn't regret it. I had heard the Guild was back on its feet again and most of Skyrim under its belt.
Sometimes I swear I can hear strange noises rolling down from up there. It sounds like thunder, but there's never any rain.
Straight to the point, eh? No need for tedious hows and whys. I like that. Leave those details to your betters, am I right?
The Daedric prince of the unknown. Hermaeus Mora. I thought there were no secrets left to know. Until I first spoke to him.
The Empire brought stability, assurance to the people of Morthal, even if they didn't appreciate it. Now what do they have?
The last few pages seem to describe [QUOTE]the failure of the Nightingales[QUOTE] although it doesn't go into great detail.
The last thing I saw was Karliah dumping his body into a opening atop the ruins; an unceremonious end for a remarkable man.
The measure of a man is taken at the moment of his death. And know this for truth, the ghosts of many heroes walk among us.
The Nords are tired of spending our blood fighting the Empire's wars, and paying for the Empire's decadence with our taxes.
The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and Arondil scribbling in his journals.
The thing is... we don't actually have an attic room. But I think I know what you mean. Go ahead and make yourself at home.
The wise trader finds the best opportunities, even if he must travel far to find them. Skyrim is a ripe opportunity indeed.
Then you know where we stand. Make your kill, and we're square. Repayment of your debt is but a discreet knife thrust away.
Then you'll need to find Elenwen's office and search her files. Malborn should be able to point you in the right direction.
There are spells yet to be learned, powerful spells that can more closely and more permanently bind creatures to your will.
There is skill in magic, there is charm, and there is a strong will. J'zargo will be successful, of this there is no doubt.
There's hagravens in that cave with talons like daggers. They'll open your bowels quick as a wink if you let 'em get close.
There's no need to be rude, Grelka. If you don't care for Argonians, then perhaps you should take residence somewhere else.
There's still the matter of the prisoner to discuss. Now, his family is willing to contribute handsomely if we release him.
There's the stories about Helgen, bandits, skirmishes between the Stormcloaks and the Imperials... it almost seems endless.
These are trying times for us all, I know. Many come to the Temple of Kynareth to pray, and I assist them as best I'm able.
They aren't invading, milord... it's simply a response to Ulfric and his Stormcloaks. I assure you everything will be fine.
They started the Great War. Nearly destroyed the Imperial City. Then the Emperor took the coward's way out and surrendered.
They're probably trying to scare us into giving them more money and influence, so they can save us from the dragons threat.
They've been raiding the farms for food, and supplies are scarcer than ever. Maybe I should sell swords and armor, instead.
This here's the Darkwater. Comes down from Lake Honrich into the White River, a few miles downstream. Good fishing, I hear.
This whole place appears to be a shrine to Reman. He ended the Akaviri invasion under mysterious circumstances, you recall.
Those invested in Restoration magic find Healing Hands to be essential. Can you cast it on me? That would prove your skill.
Through reasons I'm still trying to discover, I ended up orphaned then taken in by a kindly Argonian family in Black Marsh.
Try as you may, they won't say [QUOTE]good day,[QUOTE] but will just walk away. Worry not, Morthal! Lurbuk is here to stay!
We believe the your efforts should be directed towards dealing with the aftermath, but we cannot predict what that will be.
We Nords were proud warriors once. And we still could be. Evidenced by the men and women who fought and died bravely today.
We stand at the tomb of Hevnoraak, who has been dead for many generations. I fear, however, that his return may be at hand.
We've been down this road before, Mikael. Save the sap and sadness for your lady friends. My patrons need life! Cheeriness!
We've been keeping this collection since the Second Era. Books have come and gone during that time, but it's mostly intact.
Well, at least you didn't do anything stupid. Next time, when you're given a job, don't wander off or take your sweet time.
Well, I'm proud of both of you. I haven't been so busy since those nobles from Solitude come into the city three years ago.
Well, least I can do is give you something for taking care of him. If you won't accept it as a payment, consider it a gift.
Well. Whatever the truth of it, I'm sure a few words with Master Rulindil will have a salutary effect. Take her downstairs.
Well... If I'm being honest, I haven't exactly been discreet lately in expressing my frustration with this whole situation.
What are you waiting for? My husband is out there somewhere with that lunatic. Find them! Do what you've been tasked to do!
When they look upon us, they see only pickpockets and skooma dealers. It is most unfair, but we do our best to ignore them.
When Ulfric Stormcloak becomes High King, Skyrim will finally be the way my ancestors intended. It's a new day in Markarth.
Whiterun's army will no doubt be bolstered with Legionnares. And those walls around Whiterun are old, but they still stand.
Winterhold itself died in the years between then and now. What's left out there is a husk. Only the College really remains.
With the Elder Scroll that was used to break Time, you may be able to... cast yourself back. To the other end of the break.
Without the antidote I administered, you'd be as still as a statue. I treated your wounds and didn't leave you defenseless.
Work? I suppose you can call it that. I call it slavery. I work my fingers to the bone keeping this disgusting place clean.
Xhuth! Black-Briar or not, say that again and so help me you're going to need more than your mother to protect you from me.
Yatul and I do all the hunting. Mul and Gadba do all the mining. It seems like all you do is find more wives to get killed.
You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away unless ya' can talk Maven Black-Briar into letting me outta' my debt.
You did the best you could, brother. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point.
You must have been away from your kind for a long time to forget. Come, speak to the chief and the wise woman and remember.
You've shown yourself mighty, both in Voice and deed. In order to defeat Alduin, you've gained mastery of dreadful weapons.
*Sigh* I was part of the gang in the ruins here. Friend of mine went crazy and stole the boss' sword. They blamed me for it.
A word of advice, my friend --  do not mix gambling and drink. Taken together, they will empty your pockets of every septim.
After a few minutes, she looked me dead in the eye and asked me if I wanted to join the Guild. Just like that, no apologies.
After each battle, more dead were buried, and the graveyard got bigger. I've heard it's now the biggest graveyard in Skyrim.
Ah, so now my dear Pelagius can hate himself for being legitimately afraid of things that actually threaten his existence...
Ah! Good, good! No more barking at all hours, and chewing up my slippers. You used the hemlock, then? Damned good idea! I...
Ah. Maybe you just want to know how to get there. It's near Riverwood, a miserable little village a few miles south of here.
Also trampled on the sacred name of Talos, and gave the Thalmor free reign to stamp out Talos worship throughout the Empire.
Always good to see a fellow traveler. I hope you've found the roads relatively safe. Free from dragons, at the very least...
And a hefty cut for yourself too I'm sure. Just see to it the items are secured and the rest disposed of properly this time.
And just who in Mara's name are you, anyway? Hmm? Come here, telling me my business. And for what? To help a... a... a fool!
And more, dribbling in from time to time. I'll assign them to you as they become available. To be completed at your leisure.
And now Silus is back and this museum to the Mythic Dawn is his way of trying to rebuild his family's pride. It's misguided.
And perhaps more importantly, we have a brother rotting in an Imperial prison. He won't languish in there long, will he now?
And the Imperial Legion needs your help, especially now, with that dragon out there somewhere, and Ulfric back on the loose.
And then there's this Orc who's been hanging around causing me headaches. Something about a vision quest he needs help with.
And we hear a handful of Imperials are realizing they are Stormcloaks at heart. We need to send them a little encouragement.
Are you daft? This isn't the Dark Brotherhood! We don't go around murdering anyone, ever. It just isn't how things are done.
As I remember things, it was you that showed up at my doorstep looking for a job and a place to live. Try and remember that.
As more of the sick and injured came to the temple, my work as a healer became more important than my duties as a priestess.
At least, when we can get shipments to her. We're late on the last one. I expect her to start breathin' fire any moment now.
Better than nothing, I suppose. But Ulfric will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Markarth without a fight.
Bring those items back to me and I'll be happy to experiment on you. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you.
Brynjolf actually caught me trying to pick his pocket in the market. If he was anyone else I would have gotten away with it.
But I do realize it's sometimes not that easy. You may want to make a statement, or a contract may require a public killing.
But not anymore. The Dragon War was a real event, although only the barest glimmer of the actual events has come down to us.
But remember, Whiterun is home to the Companions. Any dragon that comes here will get more than he's bargained for, I think.
But to go this far. To attempt to murder the leader of a Sanctuary. Cicero must pay with his life. There is no other option.
But wait. What about soul reversal? You must be aware of the consequences when using the apparatus near an open magic field.
But was it worth tearing Skyrim apart, and maybe destroying the Empire? No, Ulfric will have a lot to answer for in the end.
Camilla Valerius knows I'm the best man in Riverwood. That elf is kidding himself if he thinks she would choose him over me.
Changed your mind? Come with me. I'm heading to Riverwood. It's just up the road and my uncle Alvor is the blacksmith there.
Consider this. What greater glory than to serve the Emperor and his citizens here in Skyrim, in these days of greatest need?
Dawnstar's fate rests in that tiny bottle. The longer we wait, the more damage Vaermina could be doing to those poor people.
Despite your mistakes, I see more potential in you than half the snot-nosed footpads that stumble their way into the Flagon.
Do what I do. Walk up to your target, introduce yourself, melt their skin off, and then run like the wind. Works every time.
Don't worry, I promise this will be short and sweet. If you'll just meet us in the center of the cistern room, we can begin.
Excellent work. A hero and his faithful companion, retrieving the ancient artifact for the prince. It's almost... storybook.
Falion is the only one I know who is public about what he does. He was once my teacher here, but left the College years ago.
Finding Mara was the greatest moment of my life. I'll never forget the warmth that spread through my heart when we embraced.
First time in Markarth, traveler? Take my advice. You see anything, don't get involved. The city guard will take care of it.
For too long he's been hand-picked by the Emperor, and given emphatic nods by milk-drinking Jarls addicted to Imperial coin.
Good, my experiments are at a critical stage and these are just what I need to finish. Here's some coin for all the trouble.
Ha! Well, when you put it like that, it certainly puts things into perspective. But enough wallowing. And thank you, Danica.
He was an Apprentice here at the College. Not very skilled, but got involved with a group of mages who took a liking to him.
Honestly, the debt is secondary here. What's more important is that you get the message across that we aren't to be ignored.
How did you... you reach beyond your station, new blood. Let's wait and see how we judge your Trial before speaking further.
How went your encounter with  Ma'randru-jo? Back in Hammerfell, I always loved watching two cats rip each other to shreds...
However, if you'd wish to eliminate that burden for me... well, let's just say it would go a long way with earning my favor.
However, with such a long shot, it's more than likely that's the only shot you'll be able to take before your prey runs off.
I am not adorable, it was not funny, and he wasn't a merchant. He was a Khajiit monk, a master of the Whispering Fang style.
I can't imagine what happened to the dwarves. How could a race with the capability to build a place like this simply vanish?
I ended up selling that ship to open this place. Seemed only fitting to name it after her. Well, changed it a bit I suppose.
I envy you. Facing such a beast in combat. Smelling its blood on the air. That is what songs are sung about, Shield-Brother.
I fear attendance is down. There are so few worshippers coming to see us. Could it be that the war has weakened their faith?
I have brought you here, mortal, to be my champion. You will enter my temple, retrieve my artifact, and destroy the defiler.
I have it on good authority that the crown is within Tolvald's Cave; dropped by a Dunmer caravan leaving Morrowind long ago.
I haven't signed any deals yet, but I'm sure my cousin will want a cut if I do. What better way to soothe his wounded pride?
I know your sights are set beyond this town, but for now, while you're under our roof, I need you to pitch in a little more.
I made the mistake of borrowing coin from Sabjorn. He's allowing me to pay it back, but he's working my fingers to the bone!
I never would have suspected that the Eye could be so dangerous. Tolfdir is right, isn't he? Magic really can overwhelm you.
I should hope so. The Dark Brotherhood is also known to place contracts on those who associate with the Morang Tong as well.
I tried to get Ulfric to even come down here to see the squalor, but the High Lord of His Mightiness couldn't find the time.
I was hoping you'd change your mind. Come on. I'm heading to Riverwood, just up the road. My sister Gerdur will help us out.
I'll ask that you please keep your voice down while inside, as others may be working on research or... delicate experiments.
I'll gather together some able-bodied warriors to clean out Movarth's lair. They'll be waiting outside for you to lead them.
I'm afraid [QUOTE]acceptable[QUOTE] just isn't acceptable anymore. I'm sure they can spare a few more coins in monthly rent.
I'm just a little girl! The Dark Brotherhood killed my mama and papa, and then they took me captive! Please, please help me!
If Indaryn finds out, he'll have me thrown out of the Meadery for certain. So don't breathe a word of it to him. Not a word!
If the workers had a dispute, we'd rough them up. If competitors tried to buy honey from Aringoth, we'd steal the shipments.
If you meet him, don't expect much in the way o' conversation. He ain't one for talking, especially with folk he don't know.
If you were to bring me the deed to Goldenglow Estate, so I was the full owner, that would be a step in the right direction.
In fact, here it is now. Think of it - a never-ending stream of minions. And all of the prestige of being Sanguine's chosen.
It is entirely possible that they look to our College here in Winterhold in order to find supporters for their organization.
It is the last resting place of an assassin of old. A Dark Brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you.
It's about time; I sent them a letter weeks ago. That Elgrim... he'd forget his own pants if his wife didn't help him dress.
It's an old Nord Tradition, a test to prove your worth in the eyes of Kyne. Show that you're a hunter and no simple butcher.
It's an old tree. Very old. They say it was a seedling when the first men were arriving from Atmora, thousands of years ago.
It's no secret why you're here and you have proven your skill in combat. Let us talk a moment, and no one else needs to die.
It's not that easy. She'd go to the Jarl if she knew I was even remotely involved. You have to get it to her some other way.
It's working, Galmar. Our patience has won us friends and allies. And our armies are systematically taking care of the rest.
Its been difficult. I've taken the burdens of this city's problems upon myself and I keep running into impossible obstacles.
Listen, lass. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer... the leadership of the Guild.
Look, either you get the notes or I'll figure out another way to do it. Just come find me if you can get your hands on them.
Luckily Windhelm is cold, so the dead don't rot as quickly. Sometimes the burial has to wait for the ground to thaw, though.
Madanach has been found to be the true murderer of Markarth. On behalf the city, I apologize for your wrongful imprisonment.
Make love like a sabercat or crush your enemies to dust like a giant! Only a mere 20 gold coins and all this could be yours!
Make sure those forged documents get to the Legate in Morthal. They should give them the wrong idea... and us the advantage.
May the spirit of Lavinia and all those who have left this world and its suffering know the beloved serenity of Aetherius...
Maybe you've been listening to Erikur. There's been loose talk among some of the Thanes, and I suspect he's the cause of it.
My parents live there. I usually make the journey to bring them gifts and to just say hello, but I haven't been well lately.
My spirit didn't manifest itself in the Sepulcher immediately, so fortunately I wasn't present when the Ebonmere was sealed.
No. She's such a nice woman. Comes by every day looking for jewelry for her family in Cyrodiil. Is it because she's a noble?
Now you people dictate everything we do. Don't want us acknowledging a [QUOTE]mere human[QUOTE] like Talos as the god he is.
Now, you're supposed to get something for your trouble, aren't you? How about some gold? People seem to like that, I notice.
Of course I do. If I didn't, most of these books would've been burned to ashes or dissolved to nothing before the Third Era.
Of course not. One does not gather the most important men and women of Skyrim and then serve them cheap ale and stale bread.
Oh yes, there have been attempts on the Jarl's life. More than one would-be assassin has met his end at the tip of my blade.
Our tree here in the city was grown from a cutting of that tree. You can still feel the glory of the mother tree through it.
Patience, Illdi. We study the heroes of the past so we can have better understanding of the heroes of today... and tomorrow.
See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. I never understood how my sister could stand living in the shadow of that place.
See? I even have a little potion for the Steward. Mind handing it over to him? Just say it should solve that problem he has.
She's a maid. Old, and feeble. But with this contract it's much more a matter of [QUOTE]where[QUOTE] than [QUOTE]who.[QUOTE]
Sky Haven Temple. An ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden deep in the crags of the Reach. That's where we'll find Alduin's Wall.
Smart man. Now come along with us. We'll take any stolen goods, and you'll be free to go. After you pay the fine, of course.
So you as good as admit you're working for the Imperials. Yet you walk in here, and ask to join me. What are you playing at?
Some line about this claw thing and Yngol Barrow. He said it was worth more than its weight in gold if I took it back there.
Something must've gone wrong, and he ended up in the state he's in now, fused to the energies that flow through the College.
Thank you for telling me the truth. You should speak to Sven. I'm sure he'll want to thank you, too, for defending his name.
That'll come in handy, yeah? An alchemy station, maybe a little garden with some choice plants. All right, consider it done.
That's a true Nord hero. A legend. So great that the Divines themselves lifted his soul into the heavens and made him a god.
The attacks he makes on himself can be seen here fully. They are always carried out on the weakest part of his fragile self.
The catch was, he had to head out there with our wood. So not only is Leifnarr gone, but a good bit of our supplies as well.
The College has undertaken a fascinating excavation in the ruins of Saarthal nearby. It's an excellent learning opportunity.
The Dragonborn is said to be uniquely gifted in the Voice - the ability to focus your vital essence into a Thu'um, or Shout.
The Emperor will be paying close attention to what happens here today. Men who distinguish themselves will be well rewarded.
The last time I was in Whiterun, the tradesmen were talking about you. It seems your reputation as a businessman is growing.
The only untapped market left is Markarth. However, I just got word that Kleppr at The Silver Blood Inn might be interested.
The orichalcum ingot should still be in Winterhold at the Frozen Hearth Inn. I don't know why I didn't just take it with me.
The same words were used to greet the young Talos, when he came to High Hrothgar, before he became the Emperor Tiber Septim.
Then Ulfric and his men came. Those of us who didn't run were executed, except for myself, my king, and a handful of others.
There are also spells that help in avoiding conflict altogether. Invisibility is tricky to master, but exceptionally useful.
There are ruined sewer tunnels beneath the city. The only way I know how to get in there is through a door off of the canal.
There's some trouble in Haafingar. The Legion's too busy with the war, and they're hiring us to take care of their problems.
These are no dainty college mages. Bashnag has the skill of a magister and the mind of a warlord. This is a dangerous bunch.
They say a priest of Mara is visiting the Windpeak Inn. Says the Divines will take care of everything. We'll see about that.
They're mercenaries, only in it for the money. They're led by a man named Kematu. Get rid of him, and the rest will scatter.
They're stolen idols! Imposter gods, sold by silver tongues. No thank you. Froki will not forget Kyne, or her Sacred Trials.
This little experiment is a first step in recreating the events of their disappearance in an effort to unravel that mystery.
This missive should convince him. Be aware soldier, these documents contain sensitive intelligence for the Jarl's eyes only.
To begin with, killing any Legionnaire you find out in the wilderness. I've reports they've hidden military camps out there.
Tsk. And to think, I was going to feed you cabbages and apples again. Yes, little fairy, we can go to the tavern for supper.
Vici has obvious Imperial connections. Her husband has ties to the Stormcloaks. Their union is a step toward reconciliation.
We are poised for glory, Jod. The Empire will never take Dawnstar while every last man, woman, and child here draws breathe!
We must drive away his mist, Shouting together, and then unsheathe our blades in desperate battle with our black-winged foe.
We should be fighting those witch-elves, not bending knee to them. The Emperor is nothing more than a puppet of the Thalmor.
Well that's where I want to build. In the fall forest. Give it an easterly view. The sunrise is almost as pretty as you are.
Well, I call it blasphemy! A true son of the Empire would never have turned his back on our greatest hero, not at any price.
Well, I suppose it's back to the Shivering Isles. The trouble Haskill can get into while I'm gone simply boggles the mind...
Well, it was. Sadly, this forge is dying and I've used the last of my fire salts. If I can't feed it soon, it may grow cold.
Wha... Your shoes? We get robbed by bandits, my clothes torn to shreds by some giant cat, our bodyguard eaten by a dragon...
Whatever damage has been caused can only be corrected by following the Pilgrim's Path to the Ebonmere and replacing the Key.
When the Thalmor want something, they tell you straight. In my experience, they have no interest in subtleties and innuendo.
When they left, he took off after them. Stole supplies and books from the College, I suppose as a way to ingratiate himself.
When you get to Whiterun just keep going up. When you get to the top of the hill, you're at Dragonsreach, the Jarl's palace.
When you told me of your intent to join the Thieves Guild, I honestly didn't think we'd have much to speak about ever again.
Whenever a man's life is saved by armor made with these hands, these hands have changed that man's destiny and his family's.
With the Ebonmere closed, and their sudden severance from the realm of Evergloam, I fear they've undergone a drastic change.
Yes, they have. I can feel the difference already. But of course, I'm far more in tune with these sorts of things than most.
Yes, yes. We must think. He must have some means of travelling to and from Sovngarde. But no tale tells where that might be.
Yet if only a single part of our imperfect machine fails, life fails. It makes one realize how fragile... how flawed we are.
You have been chosen to be her champion. I know it is unexpected, but do not worry. It will all unfold as she has predicted.
You must understand. If Cicero is turning the others against me... against us... Our Family would not survive such division.
You need only ask about. Plenty o' folk in Whiterun with too much fat and gold to be bothered doing anything for themselves.
You outsiders never learn. If the Forsworn don't get you, the guards will throw you in Cidhna Mine to work your fingers off.
You still have the witches' heads? Excellent. Throw one of them into the fire. It will release their magic, for me at least.
You won't. The Jarl has ordered a life sentence for you. Get comfortable in the dark, 'cause you'll never see the sun again.
You. Mortal. You are worthy of speaking to. You have claimed the pieces of my Razor. It has been an amusing game to witness.
You'd be wasted as a regular soldier. I have special plans for you. You'll be of greater use to me with greater flexibility.
You'd better hope there's still a chance for you to prove yourself, though, or this Trial might last longer than you'd like.
You'd make a better Imperial ranger than me. I may have charmed the locals, but my fellow soldiers hated my waggling tongue.
You'll be clearing a nest of those Hagraven things. I've never faced one myself, but I hear... disturbing things about them.
You've got no sense of humor, you know that? Why don't you pick up where you left off with [QUOTE]The Real Barenziah.[QUOTE]
Your victory here justifies our belief in you. You have proven yourself more than worthy to guide the College of Winterhold.
...Yeah. We can't have that rheumy-eyed fool as our watchman, even if he is Hajvarr's uncle. Time we dealt with both of them.
[QUOTE]For Clan Battle-Born![QUOTE] they cry in the mead halls. [QUOTE]First into the fray and last to quit their ale![QUOTE]
[QUOTE]I breathe now, in royalty, and reshape this land which is mine. I do this for you, Red Legions, for I love you.[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]May the scales of the dragonkind splinter at the touch of your arrows and crack under the weight of your sword.[QUOTE]
Ah. Well. After a little incident with a roguish lad and the daughter of a prominent Thane... Well, let's just say, best not.
And do what? Losing a job from the Black-Briar family would make me a marked man. No one would ever take me on anywhere else.
And then there's a tiny problem with a giant attacking our supply caravans. A giant! As if I didn't have enough to deal with.
And we have come this far because our cause is true. Because we fight as one. And because our hearts are bursting with anger!
And, as much as I'd like to kill the man myself, we can't risk an all out war with the Empire. We'll bide our time for now...
And, as you told me once, the next world will have to take care of itself. Ful nii los. Even I cannot see past Time's ending.
Another trap, most likely. Things are dangerous... three of the guards died when the lower hall flooded with steam last week.
Aren believed that although the initial communications were innocent enough, they were sent with a particular motive in mind.
As I said, I want you to kill several people. You'll find the targets, as well as their manners of elimination, quite varied.
Azura has given me the gift of foresight. I had a vision of you walking up the steps to this altar long before you were born.
Bah! Useless. Here's your gold. Now go see Astrid. The time to move against the Emperor has finally come. Sithis help us all.
Bassianus wants to marry me. And I think I love him. But he wants to move to Riften afterwards, and my father won't allow it.
Before both of you arrived, I recovered a journal from Gallus's remains. I suspect the information we need is written inside.
Bolli, I was looking at the finances and I noticed you've been donating gold to the Temple of Mara. Are you out of your mind?
But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate it. Left it here to decay. Until you came.
But you're probably more interested in Jorrvaskr, mead hall of the Companions. Their deeds of war and valor are... legendary.
By weaving the darkness to their will, this agent can manipulate others into fighting for the Nightingale for a limited time.
Come on, father, how hard can it be? They're just... big lizards. And those scales and teeth, they must be worth a fortune...
Constance, sometimes she gives me little snacks. Which is good, 'cause we only get but one meal. Late, too, in the afternoon.
Despite the far-reaching fame of Alduin's Wall at the time - one of the wonders of the ancient world - its location was lost.
Don't just stand still to do your big wind-up blows. Which way you're moving changes what happens and can be a big advantage.
Etienne must know something related to the dragons... who else might know? Greasy Thom... no, they'd see right through him...
Father, how come Olda's so mean to everyone? She's only ever happy when she's with Lodvar, and she's not even married to him!
Fear neither pain, nor darkness. For Sovngarde awaits those who die with weapons in their hands, and courage in their hearts.
First off, there's a couple of Imperials skulking about the hold. Need to cut their throats so they can't make their reports.
Good job. The more citizens that join the fight against the rebels, the sooner they will see the futility of their rebellion.
Ha! That'll teach the little jester to go bothering the decent, hardworking folk of Skyrim. Fool never should have come here.
Ha. Don't toy with me. I may just have to seize my opportunity with both hands, ha ha ha. But we'll play it your way for now.
Have a client lookin' to have a rival's business ledger changed. Don't know the reason, and don't want to know. Count you in?
Have faith, Bryling. When this war is over and Ulfric is dead, you'll see that you were jumping at shadows, and nothing more.
He's a vampire, and has blended into human society for years. He's never far from his female companion, Hert. Also a vampire.
He's had some troubles in his life, but I can't have him drinking here without at least paying back some of the coin he owes.
Hold a moment. This is more than a simple prison break. I want to have Arn's name stricken from the record books permanently.
I am, and I don't want to hear your moral judgments about it, either. I wouldn't have had to study in secret in the old days.
I believe it to be a falsehood perpetrated by the Empire in order to weaken the citizen's confidence in your ability to rule.
I came here hoping to learn that more Imperial reinforcements were on their way to Skyrim, but so far I've been disappointed.
I can't agree to any peace council until I know Tullius will be there. The other Jarls could take that as a sign of weakness.
I can't think of anyone better suited to return the Key. Just remember to keep your eyes open and walk true with the shadows.
I couldn't have said it better myself. It's been some time since I've had news from elsewhere in Skyrim. What have you heard?
I don't usually deal in weapons, but I know someone who can get them for me. You mind paying a little extra to get them fast?
I grew up in The Pale. This land was my home for most of my life... and for a Dunmer, that's quite a statement, I assure you.
I guess we also owe you something for locking you up. Here, my family's ring. And everything the guards confiscated from you.
I just think they've let my sister's death skew their outlook on Ulfric and what he really brings to the table with this war.
I run the prisons in Riften, keep the riff-raff from robbing the good folk of this city and have drunks tossed into the lake.
I will teach you the spell to summon the Dremora, but know that it will only work in a place properly prepared for the event.
I would never knowingly place Laila in danger, you know that too. Why do you always question my judgment? You don't trust me.
I'd rather not tangle with her right now. We might be able to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and watch where you step.
I'll cut right to it. You murdered the old woman in the orphanage. You owe the Dark Brotherhood a kill. I've come to collect.
I'll explain what I want when I want, got it? You'd already be dead if I didn't like the look of you when you walked in here.
I'll make this very simple for you. All my trades are final. Onmund knew this ahead of time, and went through with it anyway.
I'll try to hold to your hopeful purpose. Quickly, before this encompassing fog once more snares me in the World-Eater's net.
I'm afraid you'll have to come back later. I've been given strict instructions that no one be allowed to trouble Lady Elisif.
I'm looking for a place called Bard's Leap. They say the echo of a song sung from there can be heard all the way in Solitude.
I'm not asking, but if you happen to be the type, I hear that Kilkreath Ruin is a shrine to Merdia. You know. Daedra worship.
I'm sure she would want you to be happy, father. Entertaining the guests and drinking and making your lewd jokes like before.
I've heard that a priest of Mara has come, saying that the Divines will lift this curse somehow, but that remains to be seen.
I've never heard of anything like that. Did you ask Tolfdir? He's been here a long time, and seems to know almost everything.
I've never liked having the Imperials right on Windhelm's doorstep. Retaking Winterhold would help secure our supply lines...
If you change your mind, speak to Braig. Tell him I sent you. I want you to know how widespread the injustice of Markarth is.
If you happen across any other unusual trinkets like this, be sure and bring them to me. I promise it'll be worth the effort.
If you want to go to the trouble, feel free. I suppose I could offer you a bit of free Alteration training when you get back.
If you're really Dragonborn, they'll want to talk to you. In the old stories, they always summon the Dragonborn for training.
If your eyes and your ears are open and your mind is free of judgement and expectation, you might learn much in this chamber.
In fact, he's the reason I chose to learn the smithing trade. I want to make weapons and armor for the great Stormcloak army.
In honor of his memory, let me show you a few shield techniques. And tell me if you're leaving town. Be good to travel again.
In time, Falkreath came to be known as the heroes' graveyard. Many noble Jarls and renowned warriors asked to be buried here.
Instead of projecting the sky, we project all of Tamriel, and then harness the latent energies to overlay the positions of...
It's a sword. I made it for the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater. It's a surprise, and I don't even know if he'll accept it. But...
It's from that treaty that ended the Great War, remember, when the Emperor was forced by the Thalmor to outlaw Talos worship.
It's the things she makes here, the things she says and all those poor little animals she tests them on. It's just not right.
Lady Maven could buy or sell anyone in Skyrim. I wouldn't be surprised if she's the one pulling the strings around this city.
Last we have deathbell which only grows in marshy tundra terrain. Its inverted bluish-purple flower bunches are unmistakable.
Lazy and useless, the lot of them. They can't even keep the Stormcloaks in line. No way I trust them with the Emperor's life.
Likely only Ulfric's death, or the overthrow of the Jarls supporting him will end this. Either way, much blood will be spilt.
Listen well, friend, and lighten your mood while words I'll spin of warriors bold, whose deeds of valor brought undying fame.
Look around you. Don't you know what their little war is about? They want all non-Nords out of Skyrim. That means you and me.
Look, his name is Balagog gro-Nolob. He's an Orc! The Gourmet's an Orc! He's staying at the Nightgate Inn. That's all I know!
Look, I like you, so I'll tell it to you straight. Brynjolf and the rest are in the Guild, and they're ready to cut you down.
Look, I only buy things I can turn around quickly for a profit. And no one wants those stones unless they have the whole set.
Made a lot of coin, but I didn't care. I didn't really need it... I was running with them because it fit, made me feel alive.
Master Elgrim says I'm a natural; that I have a unique talent. But I fear his approval masks his intolerance for my mistakes.
Mirabelle is dead, and they're losing ground fast. I'd be there now if I hadn't seen... I had one of your 'visions', I think.
Muiri? I can't believe my family trusted that backstabbing little strumpet. You tell her she's dead to us. You hear me? Dead!
My brothers would have been appalled to see a man outdone by his wife, but not me. Without Katla, this farm would fall apart.
My lateness is due more to getting lost on the way up this gods-forsaken mountain than to any desire to actually arrive late.
My little Friga loved to cook, but she was terrible at it. Then one day, out of nowhere, she made the most amazing leek soup.
My mother always loved the sea. When I was young, we'd visit Solitude and watch the ships from the bluff. Ah... better times.
My wife Hafjorg, well, she's a necessary evil I suppose. Not a lick of talent when it comes to alchemy, but she keeps me fed.
No, my wife. You have been given other gifts to please your chief than mine work. I will talk to Gharol and all will be well.
No. A chief's daughter marries who her chief wishes. It ensures the stronghold receives a fair trade in goods for my absence.
Not just ordinary gems. They're said to be flawlessly cut and as big as a man's head. Can you imagine how much they're worth?
Now please, go. Collect your money, and let us never look upon one another again. Our business, thank the gods, is concluded.
Now that Ebonmere has been restored, you stand before me awaiting your accolades; a pat on your head... a kiss on your cheek.
Now, you are going to speak to this... Monk... and find out why he is here, and then he will be removed from College grounds.
Oh, and that busybody Viola Giordano. She's got her nose in everyone's business, which I guess is one way of being prominent.
Oh, have no fear. The Jarl himself has finally taken an interest, so I'm now able to devote most of my time to this research.
Our coffers are nearly empty. I can scarcely afford to pay the guards, and we need every one of them in these troubled times.
People have forgotten humor, poetry and romance. I love a good sword fight as much as the next man, but there's more to life.
Please, enjoy the festivities! This is a day of peace and happiness, when Imperials and Stormcloaks join together, as equals!
Please! Help me get out of this cage. I don't know why those things locked me up and I don't want to wait around to find out.
Poor Cicero has failed you. Poor Cicero is sorry, sweet mother. I've tried, so very hard. But I just can't find the Listener.
Quite. To be brief, I need compensation for the lost shipment. Since Riften was responsible for it, Riften should pay for it.
Really? Power? You're a dragonborn; you already have more power than most people who aren't immense, fire-breathing monsters.
Remember, we want people to notice. Kill Vici while she's addressing her guests, as is the custom, and I can promise a bonus.
She has an awful hunger for our memories. In return, she leaves behind nightmares not unlike a cough marks a serious illness.
Skyrim's mountains were still infested with dragons. One of the early Nord kings caught a dragon and kept it in Dragonsreach.
So congratulations, whoever you are, you've found the Synod. Just me, alone, surrounded by angry machines and angrier Falmer.
Solitude's famous for it's Bards College. Worth a visit if you've never been. Some of them can sing just as pretty as a lark.
Speak with the Blasphemous Priest at the Temple of Kynareth, in Whiterun. Accept his gold, then kill the target. Hail Sithis!
Strong, yes, but how clever are you? I'll tell you what, if you can open the lock on my chest, you can have everything in it.
Suit yourself, then. The woods are that way. Outside the walls, walk straight ahead. Can't miss them. Good luck on your hunt.
That burned paper is all that remains of the fabled Mysterium Xarxes. The blasphemous book written by Mehrunes Dagon himself.
That is correct. Those orders have been delivered by special courier. I can't trust some of our normal distribution channels.
That is correct. What I ask is no small thing, of course. But you represent the Dark Brotherhood. This is... what you do? No?
That is true. Perhaps I should be more grateful for this opportunity. Not many Khajiit can say that they have visited Skyrim.
That is who we are. The Forsworn. Criminals in our own lands. And we will cut a bloody hole into the Reach until we are free.
The changes in Morthal are of little consequence to me. So long as the laws are upheld, I do not care who does the upholding.
The Dwemer were the last to touch it. It was thought to have been destroyed by the Nerevarine, but my lord told me otherwise.
The Empire may try to reclaim Skyrim, and I need everyone ready for that. Though the biggest threat, of course, is the elves.
The Forsworn? That's right. I'll say it. We all knew. Even that fat-headed, slave-driving Mulush knew. Just ask him about it.
The job is two-fold. First, steal a letter that was sent from Solitude warning Whiterun's guard to be on the lookout for Arn.
The Nords went to war with the Falmer in the First Era. Killed them by the thousands to drive them from their snowy homeland.
The Twilight Sepulcher was constructed around it by man and mer in order to shield it from those who would exploit its power.
The waves receded in time, but the damage was irreversible. Most residents of Winterhold abandoned what was left of the city.
There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro in the plot to assassinate the Emperor.
There's a small shrine to Mara I established inside the tower's entry hall. I was hoping to seek spiritual guidance from Her.
There's always some sort of trouble in The Reach, but a local warlord has raised the stakes. We have to handle the situation.
There's an old saying that only a Nord can work the soil in Skyrim. I don't think anyone else would have the patience for it.
They die too quickly. Maybe I'll try and hold off on the paralysis next time. Give me more of a moving target. Good practice.
They were interested in research that goes outside the bounds of what the College allows, so they were... persuaded to leave.
This has to be the worst place in Skyrim to run a mill. How am I supposed to do anything with all those bears running around?
Ulfric's insurrection has reached its high tide. Soon enough the rebel Jarls will realize what it means to oppose the Empire.
We don't just take in any milk drinker who stumbles in. Talk to Kodlak if you think you have what it takes to be a Companion.
We're all eager to see them brought to justice. Maven Black-Briar has assured me that they're being dealt with appropriately.
Well I think your betrothed might feel otherwise. The two of you will need to work this out before the temple will marry you.
Well, it's a winding road up the mountain just ahead. You'll know you're in the right place once you spot the old watchtower.
Well, let me tell you something, friend. Cyrodiil is a long way from here, and in Skyrim, we will never forsake mighty Talos!
When I was young, I favored huge swords, much like you. Hard to lift these days, but I still enjoy the heft of a good hammer.
When you've been doing business like I have for decades, you quickly discover that the only person you can trust is yourself.
Why do you pester me with battles we can't win? I need my steward to plan for our victory, not nag me with every ill account.
Why to perform for my common man, of course! Why should only the courts and inns of wealthy towns be given the gift of music?
Wilhelm said he saw you speaking to one of the pilgrims on the 7,000 Steps. I told you that I didn't want you to go up there.
Wise up, Harrald. There's a storm on the horizon and it will blow through here with all its fury. It's time to choose a side.
Wise women like myself are mothers of chieftains. We guide the tribe and advice our kin on what is most pleasing to Malacath.
Wonderful. Just speak to various bards outside of the college, get there parts of the Poetic Edda and return them here to me.
Would've been fine dying for the Reach with my kinsmen, but the Silver-Bloods want their ore mined, so they threw me in here.
Years later, Sinderion simply showed up at our doorstep asking to stay for a while... said he was going to do field research.
Yes, actually. I'm partnered with Maven Black-Briar. I put up a chunk of the gold she needed to get the place off the ground.
Yes. I had Falk call you back because you were at the summoning, you have a connection to Potema now. You must deal with her.
You go if you want to. I've never seen bones this large, and want to make sure I remember them so I can tell the story right.
You look to your left, you see one way. You look to your right, you see another. But neither is any harder than the opposite.
You need to choose between those two boys. It ain't fair to Sven or Faendal to keep tuggin' on their heart strings like that.
You would do this? Three vessels in the tomb below hold the power to vanquish Hevnoraak. Before anything else, we need those.
You'd better get up to High Hrothgar immediately. There's no refusing the summons of the Greybeards. It's a tremendous honor.
You'll have to get the crystal to focus properly. Heat and cold will affect it; simple concentration spells should be enough.
[QUOTE]Even an elf can be born with the heart of a Nord,[QUOTE] Skjor said when I joined. I think he meant it as a compliment.
[QUOTE]Uncommon Taste.[QUOTE] It was published a few years ago, and became a sensation throughout the Empire almost overnight.
A group of bandits descended on Dawnstar once... if it wasn't for the guard, who knows what they could have done to the place.
Ah, but there I go, waxing poetic about my misspent youth. Now where were we? Ah yes. You're the mortal messenger. An I am...?
Ah, I have a pretty staff. Help me find Petra, wring her neck, pluck her eyes. Take my prize staff, I just want my tower back!
All I want it is to escape from this madness. And if Olfina can come with me, all the better. But I've probably said too much.
All these damn Stormcloaks. They're making me nervous. Never in a million years did I imagine they'd gain control of Solitude.
All this talk of rebellion and strife. Too many are focused on what might be instead of what is. It tires me to talk about it.
Allow me to give you her gift... a true blessing to aid you in times of need. Despair not, her warmth will protect you always!
An unguessed trove of lost lore... but the important thing is that the Blades recorded many of the names of dragons they slew.
And as for you, my little mortal minion... Feel free to keep the Wabbajack. As a symbol of my... Oh, just take the damn thing.
And if it isn't true... well, then the fight to free Skyrim goes on. Either way, I don't see the use in talking to the Empire.
And make haste! You must be in place before Cicero and his... ally arrive! They could be planning another meeting at any time!
And then, it seems an Imperial worm wiggles it's way back home, carrying information stolen from us. We need to steal it back.
And why wouldn't I be? We sing tales of kings, queens and their politics, 'tis true. But do you know who really makes history?
But it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff than this waste of flesh.
But last I heard, Nilsine is still alive. So I guess you decided not to kill her as well. I have to admit... I'm disappointed.
By inheritance, as my men are fond of saying. Can't blame them, my mother ran the Sea Squall as strictly as she ran the house.
City got attacked once by those damn bandits, come east across the lake, from Faldar's Tooth. They won't be trying that again.
Don't be so sure of that. We've intercepted couriers from Solitude. The Empire's putting a great deal of pressure on Whiterun.
Drennen, you do understand that the Lexicon at the bottom of this place holds the accumulated memories of centuries of Dwemer.
Drifa? I was looking through our books and there's an entry for [QUOTE]spices.[QUOTE] Says we spent 300 septims. What is that?
Exactly. What better way to help the cause than to put weapons into the hands of young Nord warriors dying for their homeland?
Excuse me. I'm assuming that armor you got rid of wasn't an accident, but just in case, I wanted to make sure I could take it.
Feel free to trade with our smiths for Orc weapons and armor. Train with my warriors, or purchase poisons from the wise woman.
For a century or more, the Thalmor had been picking away at the Empire. Valenwood was the first, then the province of Elsweyr.
For goodness sake, Bolli! You barely lift a finger yourself when you're here except to point at things for your workers to do.
Forgive me. It's a term I haven't used in some time. While most in Tamriel call my kind Argonian, we prefer the term Saxhleel.
Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be very generously rewarded.
Give it to me quickly, before they see us together. You've riled up the priestesses, and the guards don't take kindly to that.
Gormlaith the fearless, glad-hearted in battle; Hakon the valiant, heavy-handed warrior; Felldir the Old, far-seeing and grim.
He's the real head of this family. He may not be the eldest, but all the work that keeps us respected is handled by my Thonar.
Here you stand, talking to a still grieving widow. Why? Am I that interesting? Or perhaps there are other things on your mind.
Here. It's a letter of credit. Usable, by Astrid only, for any service or item I can provide. As per our standard arrangement.
Hmph. Tell me something I don't know. Crazy fool's already asked me about five times. Seems he's not satisfied with my answer.
Hopefully any discoveries made in your pursuits will be shared with the members of the College first. That way we all benefit.
How come you here? The king of this realm will cast you out - cursed be your name by all sons of Skyrim, with scorn unceasing.
I bought some poison. I was going to have my lazy, good-for-nothing assistant Mallus handle it, but he seems to have vanished.
I don't think so. Sorry. I would love to help you, but Elenwen can be very vindictive. I wouldn't want to get on her bad side.
I have just the place. The owner likes to stash some lovely trinkets in his strongbox like this beauty. Can you get it for us?
I heard Brynjolf wants to see you about being Guild Master. I suppose my turn will come one day, but for now you'll do nicely.
I just hope the bridge survives the war. It's the only place you can cross the Karth river for a long way in either direction.
I just hope the war doesn't come to Riverwood. There's enough trouble in the world without those Stormcloaks stirring up more.
I know that Thorald's not dead. I just know it. The Imperials have him, and are keeping him somewhere. But I don't know where.
I know there's ore still in there, I can smell it. If you think you're right then you can pack up and leave any time you like.
I second that, Igmund. Who knows what that family will do for power? They could be working with the Forsworn, for all we know.
I'd say it's time you put your nose to the grindstone and figure it out for yourself. You claim to be a thief... act like one.
I'll give them a proper burial, then head back. Come find me if you're ever in Falkreath. You'll always be welcome at my door.
I'll make an exception for you, but do not bring anything out when you leave. Too many dark deeds transpired in those halls...
I'm glad you were willing to trust me. I know it probably wasn't the best way to introduce myself. But old habits... you know.
I'm not a coward, outlander. You want me to prove it? Fine. My axe is yours. To the most dangerous corners of Skyrim and back.
I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or march his Stormcloaks up to the gates.
I'm quite pleased with your progress, you know. You've certainly proven yourself to be more than a mere Apprentice. Well done.
I'm sure you'll manage, though. If you can defeat the World-Eater, surely sweet-talking the Jarl of Whiterun isn't beyond you.
I've been informed by my steward that you've made quite an impression in the Rift; the people won't stop blathering about you.
I've been trying to find out why ever since. Gotten nowhere so far, and then I got married. Have a child of my own on the way.
I've no problem with your kind, Orc. But that stronghold you've got in the southeast? Narzulbur? It's an affront to my people.
If they had their way, you'd do nothing but sit up on their mountain with them and talk to the sky, or whatever it is they do.
If we accept one gift, how can we deny the other? As Dragonborn, you have received the ability to Shout directly from Akatosh.
If you ask me, this damned rebellion can't end soon enough. I had to end my tour of Skyrim's courts. Too dangerous too travel.
If you can get past his trained watchdog, I think your best bet might be the ramp to the second floor balcony in his backyard.
If you're feeling adventurous, I'm always looking for someone to procure valuable books from some more... dangerous locations.
If you're not interested in music or drink, you can at least talk to Corpulus. He can fill you in on any of the latest gossip.
Indeed, Elisif has become Jarl of Solitude, historically and conveniently home of the High King, backed by Imperial interests.
It ain't so bad. I miss living with my parents back in Helgen, though. Froki can't cook and there's nobody to talk to up here.
It could have been lightning, but there was no thunder. In the dream, the sense of foreboding grew, but I could never wake up.
It didn't work the first time. I tried to tell Gavros, but he wouldn't listen. [QUOTE]No, it won't be too cold[QUOTE] he said.
It was taken by a lightning strike. Wish I had time to deal with it, but it's hard enough with all these wounded from the war.
It would seem I'm bound to this place. The bitter irony of it all -- my greatest failure, and even in death I can't escape it.
It's rotten because the wood is cheap and its soaked with ale! Now we'll have to replace all the furniture before bugs set in.
Keep Mother's staff. Think of it as payment. I want to leave everything from this cursed place behind. Goodbye. And thank you.
Lilija joined the Stormcloaks many years ago, when the first of the skirmishes broke out across Skyrim. I was so proud of her.
Luckily for you, there are more pressing matters. We could make an example of you, but perhaps you could be put to better use.
Magic is shunned by most. If it can't be swung over your head and used to crack skulls, most Nords want nothing to do with it.
My brother and me bought this place when we left the army. Boy, did we lose a bundle, but at least we're not fighting the war!
My cousin disappeared one night. Some say the Thalmor grabbed him. It wasn't long before I found myself under Ulfric's banner.
My friend, you may not realize it, but you have served the Empire, indeed all of Tamriel, in ways you cannot possibly imagine.
Nice try, blossom, but I'm not a knight, I'm a mercenary. The answer's still no. Besides, your mother would miss you too much.
No. I'm surprised actually. I thought they had a stranglehold on the city, but in the last few years, it hasn't been that bad.
Our son joining the Stormcloaks. If this war had never happened, Cade would have joined the Imperial Legion, like grandfather.
Remember, it's your job to [QUOTE]deliver[QUOTE] these songs. To excite the crowd. Draw them in and they will love you for it.
Smart woman. Now come along with us. We'll take any stolen goods, and you'll be free to go. After you pay the fine, of course.
So the Blades have survived yet another disaster of their own making, and continue to meddle in things they do not understand.
So, you've returned from Mzinchaleft! A Dwarven ruin... what an exotic place for a kill. Assuming Maluril is actually... dead?
Someone wants to see this mark suffer. They're paying a good bit of coin to have us plant the evidence in their house. You in?
Stalking your prey, planting false evidence, destroying an innocent man's reputation. Truly a contract worthy of the Listener.
Sure, I've got a mark for you. Stole something quite important from a friend of the Guild and we take care of our own. You in?
Sure. A client's relative lost this item in a gambling match and they're paying us to get it back. So much for fair play, huh?
The cousin of the Emperor was murdered! In Solitude, at her own damn wedding. Not a chance we would have let that happen here.
The faction that rules the Aldmeri Dominion. The ones who almost destroyed the Empire during the Great War, thirty years back.
The Flame Atronach is a vital companion for anyone relying on Conjuration. Summoning one here would certainly show your skill.
The Greybeards can tell you much more than I can. They're the masters of the Way of the Voice and taught Tiber Septim himself.
The last time I checked, gold coins aren't falling from the heavens. You better take some jobs if you want to earn your share.
The people here work so hard, and they never allow themselves a moment of fun. It's such a pity. It won't last forever though.
The Synod's harsh rules and draconian structure are maintained only by suppressing any opposition to their Council's policies.
The thieves are up in Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town. I'd take you there, but with Lucan gone, I'm busy with the store.
The Thieves Guild has been pushing hard to regain a foothold in this city. Rumor has it they're falling apart from the inside.
The title of Thane is an honor, a gift for your service. Guards will know to look the other way, if you tell them who you are.
The whole of Whiterun is ripe with paranoia and tensions. The Jarl's court is right to fear the power I hold behind this door.
There's a sentry patrolling the area. We'll go in quiet and drop him with a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word.
There's a sentry patrolling the hill. We'll go in quiet and drop him with a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word.
They look like they were made with... well, the ancient Nords used these kinds of curved blades when they embalmed their dead.
They're saying the Dark Brotherhood has been destroyed. Wiped off the face off Tamriel. But that's not entirely true... is it?
Ulfric, too, once. He wasn't always a self-serving ego-maniac. He fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion.
Watching the wheel isn't as simple as you might think. Have to inspect all the way around the ice, make sure it's not melting.
We're ready to launch our attack on Solitude. But the Emperor's visiting! We can't risk attacking now. So we'll bide our time.
Well maybe if you would finally convince Thongvor to put you in charge of the family, I wouldn't need to question you anymore.
Well now, that's something to crow about. With Pelagius up and about you're moving right along. We'll both be home in no time.
Well you see where we have to live. This forgotten alley. All the filth from the upper quarters flows downhill, like they say.
Well, I had forgotten we had our horses tied up just outside of Windhelm... Vex rode hers back and arrived hours before I did.
Well, that's it. Sorry if it isn't the ceremony you were hoping for, but we're not exactly known for throwing our coin around.
What about your family? There must have been someone waiting for you back at the farm. Wondering if you were ever coming home?
What do you think I am, a beggar? My family has always paid back every single coin we owed, going back to Tiber Septim's time.
What's the matter, Listener? Night Mother not feeling very chatty these days? You need help from your flesh and blood lessers?
When Dengeir's health began to fail, young Sidgeir was appointed Jarl in his stead. It was simpler just to keep me as steward.
When I was young, I'd journey with my father on hunting expeditions into Morrowind. The cliff racers made for excellent sport.
When the Stormcloaks took Solitude, I thought for sure things would slow down. But they keep me just as busy as the Imperials.
With pleasure. Nature has a way of finding vengeance, though. You walk a bleak path, friend. One that will lead to suffering. 
Yes, the claw. I know how it works. The claw, the markings, the door in the Hall of Stories. I know how they all fit together!
You ask a lot of questions for a mercenary.  Just get in there and open the gate, we'll try and provide help once that's done.
You did the best you could, Dragonborn. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point.
You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation on trust in your good name. But it seems you intend to favor Ulfric.
You look like a crazy man to me. And what's in that coffin, hmm? Maybe some time in a cell will help loosen that lying tongue.
You need to get the Marks of Dibella from Bolli, Hofgrir and Indaryn. Not sure how you're going to do that, but try your best.
You there. The Dragonborn wishes to give you the chance to join the lost guardians of Tamriel. The dragon slayers. The Blades.
You think you're the only one who knows that? We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you showed up.
You'll find that in his office, in the Legion stronghold of Dragon Bridge. It's your choice. Now go, and may Sithis speed you.
You're right. Look at me, talking in circles like some old wise woman. Very well, outlander. You have my axe when you need it.
You're right. What would my forefathers think if they knew I wasn't paying my debts? Tell Haran I'll bring her the gold I owe.
Your targets are a dark elf wizard named Maluril, in the dwarven ruin of Mzinchaleft. And Helvard, the housecarl of Falkreath.
[QUOTE]By our breath we bestow it now to you in the name of Kyne, in the name of Shor, and in the name of Atmora of Old.[QUOTE]
Absolutely. When we say [QUOTE]walk with the shadows,[QUOTE] we are asking those Nightingales who have passed on to protect us.
Ahh, hmm. Yes. I, err, I was unaware that I had forgotten that. I will, err, I mean I'll take care of that as soon as possible.
All my life. I practically grew up in the Hall. My father and mother were the priest and priestess of Arkay before me, you see.
And also long enough to respect her importance to Skyrim. She plays a vital role in rooting out the forbidden worship of Talos.
And if you want to do business in Tamriel these days, well, you'd better get used to cozying up to the Thalmor. Like it or not.
And they should enjoy it while they can... I suspect all of Tamriel will again be called to arms in the not too distant future.
And? I've seen jarls come and go. This one only became Jarl because her husband died. She'll be replaced in a matter of months.
Any enchanted items will do; the usefulness of the enchantment is irrelevant. If you find anything, the class can look it over.
Are you heading to Whiterun? Could you take this letter to the priestess, Danica Pure-Spring? It's a note about Joric's health.
Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, sister.
Aw, what's wrong? Did the engagement fall through? Look, how about we call it even, as long as you bring back the wedding ring?
Bring the Blackbriar 195 Berry-Blend. It should be at its peak right now, and if it doesn't get served soon, it'll only go bad.
But be careful. If you die inside the Star, your soul will be disrupted. There's nothing anyone can do for you if that happens.
But I began to search for information about dragons - where had they gone all those years ago? And where were they coming from?
But I was a prodigy! Casting simple spells by one, completing complex incantations by three. Resurrecting corpses by seven! Ha!
But then Ulfric and his [QUOTE]Sons of Skyrim[QUOTE] started agitating about it, and sure enough the Emperor had to crack down.
By all accounts the Stormcloaks are suffering just as badly. Even Ulfric might see the sense of a truce under these conditions.
Did you read it yourself? If I recall it correctly, that has some interesting implications. You should mention that to Tolfdir.
Ever since that Imperial craven ran me through from behind, I've had trouble breathing. Don't have any trouble drinking though.
First, let me be clear. The sons of Skyrim know from bitter experience that talking to the Empire is a waste of time, or worse.
For an outlander, following it is simple. Do not steal or attack anyone in the stronghold, or be ready to pay in gold or blood.
For the moment, the Wolf Queen has retreated to a place filled with dead eager to serve her. She has gone to her old Catacombs.
Forgive me. It's a term I haven't used in some time. While most in Tamriel would call us Argonian, we prefer the term Saxhleel.
Go in quiet, break our man out, then get out of there. Don't risk combat if you can avoid it. If you can't, then give 'em hell.
Got into a scrap a few years ago at the Ragged Flagon. Some idiot who stole himself a guard's sword and kept boasting about it.
Has Tolfdir been telling stories again? I thought I made it quite clear that this was a subject inappropriate for conversation.
He proposed that the real reason Saarthal was fought over by the Elves and the Nords was because something was unearthed there.
Here's the best part. They took me as a prize, and violated me for a fortnight. Tossed me from bandit to bandit like... like...
Hopefully we can learn something from the experience. How the ancient Nords used magic, maybe even what happened to this place.
How about you get me a shiv? Not that I need one, but it's nice to have in case I need to do some [QUOTE]shaving.[QUOTE] Ha ha.
I admit, I really didn't expect these talks to succeed. Getting the Empire to agree to anything at all is quite an achievement.
I believe so. Therefore, you are to obtain that information from Virane - who the Gourmet really is, and where he can be found.
I called it home, now I know that was a mistake. I am, or was part of a coven serving the Hagravens that live here. So was she.
I can only assume she wants to test the full breadth of your abilities. So. Be polite, and professional, and represent us well.
I don't even care any more. You want to check it out? Fine. I'll sell you the thing for fifty gold, and then it's your problem.
I guess that wasn't such a big deal elsewhere in the Empire, but here it's caused a lot of resentment. Native son and all that.
I have a long-standing arrangement with the Dark Brotherhood. If I need someone in the Guild taken care of, we do it ourselves.
I have eyes within Dragonsreach. They tell me that all correspondence from other holds are sent to the Jarl's private chambers.
I have to wonder... what does the Dragonborn do once he's summoned by the Greybeards? Can the Thu'um be taught, like any skill?
I just feel like if I'm not here, then something could go wrong. Nils is a hard worker, but I wouldn't trust him to run things.
I know how to put all the pieces together. We just need to take them to Dagon's shrine and contact the Lord of Change directly.
I know, I know - we've just met. But think, by the time the party is over we'll no doubt be fast friends. I look forward to it.
I miss the days when the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns got along. Ever since the war started, we've been at each others' throats.
I spend every Friday at the fishery, so I know the meaning of hard work. All those forms to fill out and file; it's exhausting!
I told everyone he died during questioning, and I need you to track him down and make sure he doesn't show up to disprove that.
I warned him not to go in there, just like I warned you. The very next night we heard screams from the barrow, and that was it.
I was Jarl once, but I was encouraged to step down when I took sides with the Stormcloaks. It was an imperial plot, I tell you!
I'd go and search their house for proof, but they want me too. I'd be captured, and then we'll never know what happened to him.
I'm always on the lookout for all sorts of goods. Bring me whatever you... well, [QUOTE]find[QUOTE] and I'll see what I can do.
I'm going to stay a while. Rest among these bones. This creature honored us with its life, and I will honor it with my respect.
I'm here to assist anyone interested in joining the College. Also, my presence tends to frighten the locals and keep them away.
I'm seeking a small list of items to complete my next creation: two flawless sapphires, a mammoth tusk and a chunk of gold ore.
I'm sorry to say your payment for the job will have to go to elsewhere since you feel like taking things in your own direction.
I'm sorry, the Temple of Dibella is closed. You can receive your blessing, if you wish, but the other sisters are in seclusion.
I've consulted my contacts regarding the information you recovered from Goldenglow Estate, but no one can identify that symbol.
I've fought in more battles than I've got years of life in me. Pay my fee and I'll put that experience to work for you, friend.
I've got no interest in magic users. No use for their kind at all. They're way up north in Winterhold, and that's fine with me.
If my ma could see me now, she'd scold me good. She'd tell me I should know better than to go poking around in abandoned forts.
If you can locate the quill and return it to me, something Vald was too stupid to do himself, I'll consider the debt satisfied.
If you must know, I was practicing in the yard when the guard I was sparring with feinted when I specifically told him to duck!
In any event, here's my advice. Go to Riften's Ratway, find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before, no?
In life I felled foes unnumbered, fearless in battle; but no blade can defend against the terror of this gloom-stricken valley.
In Whiterun, mostly. Ennis handles the business arrangements, but I know that he has a few purchasers who give us a fair price.
Is it possible that it somehow contributed to his work? Perhaps allowed him to life multiple lifetimes in a short span of time?
Is that all? My friend, you've come to the right person. You could say that causing a scene is somewhat of a specialty of mine.
It is absolutely worthy of research, despite many of the notes I've had left in my bed. And my desk. And on occasion, my meals.
It's getting to the point where I have to scour Skyrim for untouched trees at the right size. Costs me too much time and money.
It's through this conduit that we're given Nocturnal's greatest gift, our luck. What she gains in return is a complete mystery.
It's tradition. We mark the animal as a way to let the giants know we're giving it to them willingly. Sort of a peace offering.
Jarl Balgruuf? I don't mean to be disrespectful, as he's ruled Whiterun Hold well for years, but he seems in over his head now.
Legend says that my forefather Lenne discovered the mines after he stumbled into a dark cave to relieve himself. Too much mead.
Look, I've been in this business a long time and I've seen all types. You can play it tough, you can play it smart... whatever.
Look, it's dangerous, but if you sneak the ring into her house. Put in a dresser or something. I will make it worth your while.
Mercer Frey tried to kill both of you, he betrayed the Guild, murdered Gallus and made us question our future. He needs to die.
Mercer's been storming around waiting for you to come back. I think he's finally figured out who's been messing with the Guild.
My blade bit right into the stonework next to the keep and needed serious repairs. Thankfully our smith Balimund works wonders.
My family has been doing it for years. You need one out in the Reach. Don't want to be alone when some Forsworn comes swinging.
My men are stretched thin as it is. If you offer your aid, I gladly accept. The guards will be told to assist you as necessary.
Nightshade is native to the pine forest and marshy tundra regions of Skyrim and has a distinctive starburst-like violet flower.
No, I saved your life. My arrow was tipped with a unique paralytic poison. It slowed your heart and kept you from bleeding out.
No! There's got to be more Skooma... Shut up! Shut up!  Don't lie to me J'zhar! You hid it! You always try to steal it from me!
Nord nonsense?! Why you puffed-up ignorant... these are our sacred traditions that go back to the founding of the First Empire!
Not a single man or woman in Dawnstar has gotten a good night's rest in days. We keep having the same nightmare, over and over.
Not enough to outweigh the loss of Markarth. With the Reach in enemy hands, our whole position in Solitude would be threatened.
Not on your life. It's dangerous in there, and Falk doesn't even like me and Erdi going in every year to clean out the spiders.
Nothing happens in Riften without Maven's consent. One word from her and you could spend the rest of the fourth era in prison. 
Now now, brother. Arnoit is just being his usual gloomy self, he didn't mean it, did you Arnoit? You're just being silly again.
Now we're just fellow fugitives from the Thalmor. I didn't know she was still alive, but I'm not surprised. She was a survivor.
Now, now, our duty is to record the great tales of history, not to pick sides in them. Best to stay out of the warfare, I feel.
Oh don't pretend to be modest. I'm talking about your new role as champion. Apparently, you've taken my people under your wing.
Oh, don't be such an old stick, Horik. I was joking. I can do that, you know. Redo the battle plans. I'll look over them later.
Oh, I don't think so. I think I understand perfectly. Don't worry, my dear, I will make any necessary excuses to your employer.
Oh, very well. But my energies are low. I warn you - I won't be able to see much. Give me... five gold, and I'll do what I can.
Oh, you just don't understand. Without him, I am not free! Without him, I am doomed! All of his empire shall fall into chaos...
Oh! No, I didn't mean it that way. Elgrim can barely put his on his own shoes let alone have the energy to pursue a young girl.
On the other hand, they're a violent bunch. Every night a fight breaks out and I end up with a smashed chair or a broken table.
One of the lost secrets of the Blades. Where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy.
Or you could head over to the family and see if they'll let you in. But I wouldn't want to do that myself. Bad luck over there.
Our daughter, Fjotra, was taken from here. The Forsworn descended and... they didn't touch anything else. Just our little girl.
People are rightly stirred up about the damn Thalmor being allowed to roam around arresting people, just for worshipping Talos.
Perhaps I'll tell you more about it later. Right now, you need to head for Winterhold with the journal and get the translation.
Please forgive my earlier rudeness. I am so often interrupted by visitors wandering in, I can occasionally become quite savage.
Please, let me offer you this key. It unlocks my strongbox under my stand in the marketplace. Help yourself to anything inside.
Possession of the holds change on an almost daily basis, but I can report that Haafingar is still secure. Your people are safe.
Profits continue to rise. The warehouse continues to bring in good revenues, and rent on your stores in the Well is acceptable.
Riften is off the table. The Empire barely has a toehold left in Skyrim. We don't need to pay such a high price for this truce.
Riften seems like a better choice to me. Well-fortified, easily resupplied across Lake Honrich. Plus all the mead we can drink.
Right. Well. If you have some kind of official business with the jarl, I'm afraid now's not the time. Go on then. Off with you.
Scary, thinking of those boots with an army of Elven weapons at their command. Let's be thankful they're half a world away, eh?
Scatter and get behind cover! We need to hurt it, somehow! If you've got a bow or spells, now would be a good time to use them!
Second, there are stories of a dagger called Kahvozein's Fang, said to be sharp enough to carve individual scales off a dragon.
See, Ranmir was involved with a pretty young woman named Isabelle Rolaine. The two of them were very happy together, I thought.
She's telling everyone she's sick. But she's really locked herself in her room because she fears an assassin is out to get her.
So you're a Companion, then? I can't imagine you got your gift anywhere else. I hope you have better luck with them than I did.
Solitude's been the capital of Skyrim as long as I can remember. Most of the High Kings of Skyrim were Jarls of Solitude first.
Some folk here will tell you I'm sheltering my boy too much, but I ask you, isn't it a father's duty to keep his children safe?
Sorry friend, but it looks like you're a bit light in the purse, and the wayward minstrel can't afford to do free performances.
Sorry's not good enough! Not while my Gleda is still out there, alone and afraid. You kidnapped her and sold her to that Giant.
South of here, and west of the road, lies Cronvangr Cave. Stay away from that cursed place, and the vampires that call it home.
Tell you what. How about a friendly wager, just between us. I bet you my entire purse of septims I can beat you in a fistfight.
Thanks to you, I've just been issued a challenge in front of my whole tribe, by a Daedric Prince, no less. I can't ignore that.
That's right. In the Second Era, Tiber Septim himself led the army that conquered Old Hroldan from the barbarians of the Reach.
The Agent of Stealth is the master of remaining unseen. They are able to manipulate the darkness and use it to their advantage.
The Blades! Of course. They specialize in meddling in matters they barely understand. Their reckless arrogance knows no bounds.
The dragonstone was a map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear.
The mark must have ticked-off our client badly. He's impatient and keeps asking if the job's done. Can you get him off my back?
The Nords didn't care who was and who wasn't involved in the Forsworn Uprising. I had spoken to Madanach once, that was enough.
The Silver Hand. They finally had the nerve to attack Jorrvaskr. We got most of them, but I think a few stragglers made it out.
Then by my right as acting grandmaster, I name you a Blade, with all the privileges, rights, and burdens that brings. Godspeed.
There hasn't been a Dragonborn seen in the land for centuries. Not since Talos himself walked the 7,000 Steps to High Hrothgar.
There's no resting your hide in a cell in this prison. Here, you work. You'll mine ore until you start throwing up silver bars.
They stayed at the inn, but didn't pay. They said soldiers don't need to pay because they're risking their lives to protect us.
They used to come from the Night Mother. Potential clients would perform the Black Sacrament, and she would hear their prayers.
They're the worst kind. Even the Dark Brotherhood abides by a strict set of rules and tradition. These thieves are just rabble.
This hasn't happened in ... centuries, at least. Not since Tiber Septim himself was summoned when he was still Talos of Atmora!
True enough, but there's nothing wrong with a little adventure now and then. Not much excitement in working the soil every day.
True, he turned traitor to Alduin and helped overthrow the Dragon Cult, but that does not excuse or expiate his previous deeds.
Uh huh. I'm sure he runs outside with the coin and throws it up in the air so Mara herself can catch it. Come off of it, Bolli.
Unfortunately, we're certain he has informants within the city guard. Every time we've made a move to arrest him, he's escaped.
Very. I helped raise him. Oh, I could not have been more proud to see Torygg on the throne. He made a fine king. A fine king...
We are fortunate. We travel lightly, and can escape at a moment's notice. We have no home that a dragon can burn to the ground.
We send you to plant some phony evidence in the mark's house, and then tip off the town guard... the rest takes care of itself.
We've had yet another sprained ankle due to soul gems being left on the floor. Let's please try and keep injuries to a minimum.
Well of course the Night Mother will speak to you again! She might speak now, or later, or... I don't know! But speak she will!
Well, I did hear that Ulfric Stormcloak was slain while defending Windhelm against a dragon, but it sounds too good to be true.
Well, it's kind of an understanding between us. I mean, it just wouldn't feel right to charge them for a bit of preserved food.
Well, now. I'm afraid you've caught me a bit out of my element. Most of my time is spent in the Temple of the Divines, you see.
Werewolves, wizards, eternal ten year-old vampires... what does it matter? In truth, I've rarely met a lunatic I haven't liked.
What are you doing talking to me? Didn't you know Brynjolf's been trying to find you? It's time to install you as Guild Master!
What business do College mages have in a place like Saarthal, anyway? It's a place for Nord dead... not your weird experiments.
Whatever the truth, if Ulfric get's his hands on it, it would be a powerful symbol around which to rally support for his cause.
Wuuthrad is a relic of Ysgramor. Through that weapon, we trace our line straight to the first harbinger of makind in this land.
You here to apply at the Bards College? Well don't bother - you're too damned old. Start past four, and it's all wasted effort.
You left a note but it was mostly gibberish, the only bit I could make out was [QUOTE]after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.[QUOTE]
You may be used to the Empire bowing to your every whim, but I'm afraid you'll find the Thalmor receive no such treatment here.
You should check in at Dragonsreach, too. There's so much going on these days, the Jarl or his Steward might have need of help.
You're accusing me of taking part such a... such a... heinous act? I should have you arrested for even suggesting such a thing!
You're Dragonborn. The rules don't apply to you. You can Shout the way dragons do... without training, through inborn instinct.
Your best bet would be to erase his debt with Maven Black-Briar. If you talk to her, she might be able to give you the details.
...the High King's court needs a jester... But not me. No, not Cicero. The Fool of Hearts is busy enough, thank you very much...
A god? Assuredly not! Gods are weak and ineffectual. When was the last time you heard or saw evidence of the Aedra in the world?
A masterstroke by General Tullius! He's only been in charge here for a few months, but he's turned things around for the Empire.
According to my grandfather at least. He swore that version of the legend was true, even found the cave old Lenne stumbled into.
After our drinks, we went out for a moonlight hunt. We got separated, and in his drunken state my brother mistook me for a deer.
Ah, now you must be lost. Best ya scurry off while you're able. The Ratway, well, it has a habit of swallowin' up the uninvited.
All right, all right. You sound like a damn Legion officer, but I get it. I'll give him a break. This better not hurt our quota.
All well and good. But did you know that he was Alduin's chief lieutenant in ancient times? Responsible for terrible atrocities?
Almost anyone in Riften is in dire need of those missives. Speak to them, child. You will know who will listen and who will sin.
An impertinent question. The elf must die. Either carry out my will or do not. You are not the only mortal agent I could choose.
As a sworn priest of Mara, the elixir won't work for me. The Torpor will only work for Priests of Vaermina, or the unaffiliated.
As soon as you left I sent word to General Tullius, who's been kind enough to lend us some of his troops and Legate Cipius here.
Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, brother.
Boring? That food is paying for everything. If we lose even a single crop, we could starve or be forced to beg. I won't have it!
Both. One or the other is bound to win the war eventually. Why not curry favor now, so that the victor will look upon us kindly?
Bulfrek, I have an order of swords and armor from the local blacksmith coming here. I need every piece polished to a fine shine.
But Dagon does not declare a winner while there is a pawn on the board. Kill Silus. He and his family have served their purpose.
But I swore an oath to our Dunmer friends that, for as long as I sit on the throne of Windhelm, their needs will not be ignored.
But I'm disappointed to hear you ran away from the battle. The gods do not reward cowardice. Nor do I. I expect better from you.
But of course! Tell her she'll have it. Maven is one of the few people I can trust and I'd be delighted to give her my blessing.
But remember - you're one of us now, forever. Whatever Imperial loyalties you may have had... that's all in the past, forgotten.
But that was a long time ago. There hasn't been a Listener in years, not since Cyrodiil was overrun in the war with the Thalmor.
But the token of my truth lies buried in the ruins of my once great temple, now tainted by a profane darkness skittering within.
By your scent, I'd say you were from the Guild. But that can't be true, because I told Mercer I wouldn't deal with them anymore.
Careful if you cross the river to the east. Old Hajvarr Iron-Hand and his brigands are holed up in that cave, White River Watch.
Couldn't help but notice, that, um... you dropped some armor. Just wanted to check with you before I took it. Is that all right?
Couldn't they understand that I was used? That I was grieving for Friga, too? No... they treated me like garbage, threw me away.
Damn Tullius. He's pocketed men in the Rift. It's dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.
Damn, that reminds me, I have a delivery to make to her steward, Falk Firebeard. He ordered a special bottle of Stros M'Kai Rum.
Despite your misfortunes, you stayed true to the Dark Brotherhood. You've saved us all, and for this you have my eternal thanks.
Did... did I say you weren't smart? I meant to say that I'm not smart, Lash. I'm just not smart enough to answer your questions.
Divines know the mill could use some new blades. All right. It's yours. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.
Don't worry about such things. Just focus on your own honor. Bring glory to the Companions, and that glory will return upon you.
Don't worry about them. We'll make sure they wash up safe. Maybe they'll even pay us for the heroic rescue from their sad crash.
Entire years spent in libraries. Seeking out tiny villages with local legends that contain but a whisper of a hint of the Phial.
Ever been to Windhelm? Oldest city in Skyrim, by some accounts. They say the big old palace there was built by Ysgramor himself.
Finding these lost Words would be a sufficient test, to temper your abilities with experience. Ask when you are ready to search.
Forsworn attacked a while back. Jarl had no men to spare, so the Silver-Bloods generously offered to send us to clean things up.
Given that Sky Haven Temple was sealed against the return of the Dragonborn, I would try turning all the pillars to that symbol.
He was the first to understand that the Voice should be used solely for the glory and worship of the gods, not the glory of men.
He's a dragon. Not just any dragon, but the right hand of Alduin, responsible for many atrocities during the ancient Dragon War.
Hjaalmarch is an important buffer zone between the rebel forces and the capital. Ulfric will try to break through at some point.
Honningbrew's owner, Sabjorn, is about to hold a tasting for Whiterun's Captain of the Guard and we're going to poison the mead.
I believe it is due to the very source of our concern. This object... The Eye of Magnus as your people have taken to calling it.
I can't afford to have another Sarthis blunder into Riften because they think we're too lazy to disrupt their pitiful operation.
I don't know. I think I realized that out in the world, my skills would bring me more wealth as a thief rather than an assassin.
I have no idea why, but one day, I told Roggvir I liked her. It was a stupid thing to do... He mocked me incessantly after that.
I hear the East Empire Company has reopened, thanks in no small part to you. Well done. All of Skyrim benefits from their trade.
I should warn you, Forelhost is quite haunted, but I'm sure you can handle it. Return to me here once you've obtained the staff.
I swear to you, unnatural magics are coming from that cave! There are strange noises and lights! We need someone to investigate!
I tracked it to a group of bandits nearby. But I'm no fool. I'd need the Whiterun guards or maybe hire the Companions to get it.
I trust you don't presume on our friendship? I am a Jarl, after all. I wouldn't want to appear foolish in front of these people.
I was quite surprised to find them on our doorstep. They seemed amiable enough, but their line of questioning made me... uneasy.
I will watch over you as you slumber to ensure your safety. If I deduce anything is amiss, I will use my arts to bring you back.
I wonder why they only stole Lucan's golden claw. I mean, we have plenty of things in the shop that are worth just as much coin.
I'll be down here, trying to coordinate everything with Delvin and Vex; to make sure the coin keeps flowing... and no one skims!
I'll tell you one thing, if you don't make peace with them soon you may get a walkout on your hands. Then we're both in trouble.
I'll tell you what I told him -- stay out of it. It's none of your business. Those aren't folks you want to get tangled up with.
I've been writing some notes about all the Akaviri designs we've discovered. If only the Imperial Library could see my research.
I've given standing orders to the guards to prepare water bucket runs to the harbor in case of a fire, but that's all we can do.
I've got a mark who just got an item from a relative outside of Skyrim. They probably should have been quieter about it. You in?
If you think I'd would make a move like that without asking Maven, you're out of your mind. Doing that would be a fatal mistake.
If you were expecting a palace, then maybe you're not cut out for this line of work. Our methods involve secrecy and discretion.
In mortal life, Talos was a Nord possessed of unmatched tactical skill, limitless wisdom and the power to see into men's hearts.
In the Legion, the Imperial smiths used to read books when they couldn't set their hammers straight. Wisdom of the old, I guess.
Indeed. But I abide only those whose will is aligned to my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.
It has a few final lines but that's all we needed to add. I need to head to court immediately and present this. You should come.
It just so happens, I've got some scouts along the road. Meet up with them, and together see if you can't overpower the caravan.
It was a simple matter, really, when one has mastered the art of camouflage. Scale becomes stone, becomes shadow. Then... death.
It would explain what I saw earlier... flying down the valley from the south... I thought I must have just been seeing things...
Just need to gather my tools and finish up a couple of things. No worries - I'll see to Cicero, make sure that wagon gets fixed.
Look, if I were you, I'd proceed carefully. Crossin' Maven is one of the first things you learn not to do when you're down here.
Meet the soldiers preparing for the attack. Then join them in wiping out the rebels. Once you prevail we will garrison the fort.
Mindoraan, pah ok middovahhe lahvraan til. I surely do not need to warn you that all his remaining strength is marshalled there.
Mortals call it Dawnbreaker, for it was forged in a holy light that breaks upon my foes, burning away corruption and false life.
My daughter Braith says I read too much. [QUOTE]Play with me, mother![QUOTE] Girls need to learn how to take care of themselves.
My lord, since Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising, the cost of goods has doubled. I'll need more coin if I'm to provision us properly.
My son is dead! At his own wedding! Only those Imperial dogs would have dared do something like this! Damn them all to Oblivion!
No idea, but whatever he did it must have angered Maven. No guard would lock up a Black-Briar without the old lady's permission.
No, it's the levers in the center there. Just make sure you don't pull the wrong one. Please, hurry. I don't like being in here!
Now I don't care about no deeds, or laws, or other nonsense like that. This house was empty, so I settled in. And now it's mine.
Now, might I offer some advice? You should go to Riften and find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before?
Oh, good choice. Well, good for me. I find everyone being out to get you so terribly entertaining. You might find it... less so.
Oh. Why... why certainly. I keep telling myself I'm not losing a son, I'm gaining an Imperial. Daughter. An Imperial daughter...
One sip of the elixir and your wishes will be granted. Great wealth, everlasting life or perhaps limitless power could be yours!
Please, please! This is exactly what I'm talking about. Eagerness must be tempered with caution, or else disaster is inevitable.
She said that? If I find anyone working against my wife, or this Sanctuary, I'll beat them to death with their own severed head.
Small blade. Easy to hide. I mean, sure, you could just swing a pickaxe into someone's face, but people tend to see that coming.
So that's your plan, huh? Even if you could survive, by the time you got inside, whatever documents they had would be long gone.
Somethin' out there is piss-drunk mad at us. I don't know who or what it is, but it's beyond just you and me. We've been cursed.
Suddenly the nobles are calling for a new Jarl, and all the while their pockets are jingling with the sound of Imperial septims.
That we are superior to men is an established fact. For example, take this belief in Talos. The [QUOTE]ninth[QUOTE] divine. Heh.
That's right. You're the sellsword. Thank you again. It's so nice to have help with my husband gone. Shame what happened to him.
The Black-Briars have Riften in their pocket and the Thieves Guild watchin' their back, so keep your nose out of their business.
The Ebonmere is a conduit through which Nocturnal influences our world. Not through magic or blessings, but purely through luck.
The owner of this shop stiffed us on their last protection payment, but we're taking it anyway. You want to help us on this one?
The soul gem by itself isn't enough, you see. It needs to be altered, purified. The dwarves had machines for this sort of thing.
The Thieves Guild used to run this city. Now they're nothing but braggarts and bullies, rotting to death down in their Ratway...
Then... Whiterun will stand with you, Dragonborn. We will take the risk, and gain the glory, whether it be in victory or defeat!
They have a whole mine filled with prisoners to dig up silver ore, gets smelted by workers they pay, and they own half the city.
They're masters of the Way of the Voice. If you really are Dragonborn, they're the ones who can teach you how to use your power.
This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in.
To Oblivion with all of you! You rich piles of dung walking by us like we're not there! Pretending we don't exist! How dare you!
To protect my research, for one. There are more cutthroat scholars out there who would steal my findings if they got the chance.
Trust is always difficult, especially for my people. Yet we must trust in Tullius' leadership. For what other choice do we have?
Ulfric will allow Imperial forces into the Pale. Skald the Elder will go into exile, and Brina Merilis will assume the Jarlship.
Urog and Dushnamub were such lovely children. I held them as they watched their mothers die after birth. They know me best, now.
Varnius Junius stopped by here on his way to court. He was worried about something. I'm sure Falk Firebeard could tell you what.
Vignar Gray-Mane! Your family was noticeably absent from the walls. Now I know why. Wouldn't a dagger in the back have sufficed?
We are children of the Twilight. Beings who are to be guided from the darkness into the light. And from the light into darkness.
We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever troops he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt.
We've taken to calling her Queen Alfsigr, or just Allie for short. I expect you can name her anything you like once she's yours.
Well done, indeed. This will be of great service. Understanding the enemy's position makes us all the more equipped to usurp it.
Well, here you go. Spend it wisely, and if I may... Don't allow yourself to be fooled by a pretty face. You're better than that.
Well, that is how the rest of us learn Shouts. As Dragonborn, you can absorb a slain dragon's life force and knowledge directly.
What did you do! I'm...I'm see through! This better not be permanent. You can't just go around making women invisible like this!
What? Are you telling me how to treat my workers? Do you have any idea how much metal the Silver-Blood family wants us to smelt?
What? What treachery! Defiler! Debaser and defiler! You have violated the sanctity of the Night Mother's tomb! Explain yourself!
When another person shows interest, and the two agree to be together, one of them comes to the Temple and we arrange a ceremony.
When you have a gem and have filled it return to me and I will perform the ritual. I will bring life to your dead body, vampire.
When you're rich, you can waste as much money as you like on far-fetched business ideas. In the meantime, there's a farm to run.
With all due respect, Listener, you broke what few rules we seem to have. Nazir insists you talk to him and work this issue out.
With luck, they'll soon lose heart and return to their homes and families. If not, we'll be forced to put them all to the sword.
Writings from that period, including those of Ysgramor himself, do not mention the stones and thus this idea cannot be verified.
Yeah, if your interested then I'll give you the book for free. If you like it you can come back later and I'll have other stuff.
Yes. Our order was founded after the Oblivion Crisis. We dedicate our lives to facing the threat of Daedra wherever they appear.
You and I have business to discuss. Ah, but you have not yet reported back to Astrid, have you? Do that, and then we shall talk.
You and your College have ruined years of my work, I've lost colleagues and friends to the Falmer, and you want me to calm down?
You ever met one of them cats? - kah-jeet, I think they call themselves. I hear there's whole countries full of them down south.
You seem to be a bit closer to Brynjolf than the rest of us. Is he giving you any idea why this place seems to be falling apart?
You seem to be having a small problem... or perhaps it's a big problem? Maybe if you shrunk the whole thing down a little first?
You tell this sorry bunch of thieves that they need to put down their flagons and get to work if they want to keep their status!
You will kill me, and I have accepted that fate. But regardless of your path through life, I sense in you a certain... ambition.
You'll have to prove yourselves, but I'm willing to give you a chance. Gularzob's in charge now. Let's hope he's a better chief.
You're in luck. There is a blessing the Blades used on the eve of battle. It's supposed to prepare the mind for slaying dragons.
You're letting me go? What's wrong, is my skill with a blade making you look bad? Hah! I'm kidding, friend. Until we meet again!
You're not kidding. Ulfric's the leader of the Stormcloaks - you know, the traitors trying to break Skyrim away from the Empire.
Your job is to do what I say. And I say you have many nails and fittings to make before you even touch a blade. Now get to work.
Your kind started the Great War. Nearly destroyed the Imperial City. Then the Emperor took the coward's way out and surrendered.
After running from Nightcaller Temple, I wandered Skyrim for years until I was taken in by a priest of Mara who lived in Morthal.
Agallon is an efficient man, and will certainly already have begun his tour of Skyrim. Unfortunately, we don't have his schedule.
Ah, but it almost seems a shame to give a weapon like that away, doesn't it? I suppose I could be persuaded to let you keep it...
Ah, there it is! This little gold delight is going to keep us afloat for a while. Thank you. Here's something for your hard work.
And if I may say so... it has been an honor, getting a chance to prepare a meal with, well... the best chef in the entire Empire.
And then, at a time we are still not sure when, they disappeared. The whole people, all at once. Leaving behind only their works.
And what do you do? Nothing! Not... not that I'm angry! No, never! Cicero understands. Heh. Cicero always understands! And obeys!
And when I feel myself filling with the blood of the wolf... it's like I'm bringing all the strength of all the beasts inside me.
As far as I'm concerned, those Talos-worshippers get what they deserve. All they do is cause problems for me and the other Jarls.
As we journeyed across Tamriel, we encountered tales of exotic and wondrous artifacts. We decided to collect as many as we could.
Been in the Guild a long time... joined right after Brynjolf. Not interested in leadership though, that's more his kind of thing.
Beirand's my husband. He works the forge up at Castle Dour. I barely see him nowadays, what with him filling orders for the army.
Better them than us. We lost three good men to the traps up there, and for what- just to see another damn spider clanking around?
Bryling owns the mine, and she's not selling. We make her some decent coin running this place. Keeps her living well in Solitude.
But a girl has to grow up, and life in the stronghold asked for a lot in return, so I joined the Legion. Mastered my trade there.
But a group of Dark Elf refugees gets ambushed? A group of Argonians, or a Khajiit caravan? No troops. No investigation. Nothing.
But killing me would be a mistake! Oh yes. You would displease our mother, hmm? For she's your mother too, isn't she... Listener?
Cicero may have overheard me talking to one of the others about the Night Mother. It's possible I was... not entirely respectful.
Come now. You did more than just survive all those years. Your evasion of the Thalmor would be useful for future Blades to study.
Come, let's go find Farengar, my court wizard. He's been looking into a matter related to these dragons and... rumors of dragons.
Crazy fool's asked me to fix his broken wagon wheel five times. He won't take no for an answer. Why can't he just leave us alone?
Did you leave any alive? The Afflicted are mere vessels for my Blessing. It will spread to others through their touch and my own.
Ennis prides himself on his shrewd business schemes. For my part, I'm far happier working with cattle and crops than with people.
Fair enough. I thought you might be able to see past your Imperial loyalties in the interests of peace, but I guess not. Still...
Father says I should pick a name that describes what I really am,  but nobody's going to hire Erik Greenthumb or Erik Hoe-pusher.
First, I need you to clear the main chamber of those monstrosities. I'll stay here until you're finished, planning our next move.
First, we need to limit Stormcloak capacity and send them a not so subtle message by sabotaging a resource they claim to control.
Gallus and Mercer spent the better part of a month infiltrating Irkngthand, but the dwarves had protected the place far too well.
Get out of here. I'm going to make sure we got the last of them, and see if there's any information to be gotten from the bodies.
Guards say I murdered someone. I was just sleeping off some mead in my aunt's house, but that didn't stop them from arresting me.
Ha! All right, I'm writing that in. I'm not sure about the court but I find that much more probable than Olaf capturing a dragon.
He's just a little confused at the moment, is all. Knowing my master, he may very well reward you for bringing him to his senses!
Hmm? Ah, yes. That once held the shrine to Talos. But the worship of Talos was banned by the White-Gold Concordat, some time ago.
Hopefully these gifts will put us in her good graces, secure that import deal, and lead the way to an audience with the Emperor. 
I also need to reassure Maven that it's business as usual without Mercer... and that a new Guild Master will soon be taking over.
I asked the gate guards to look for him. I can't afford to chase him down but could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company.
I dream about those days still. Except I'm not me. I can see myself there and I try to stop what I know is going to happen but...
I felt a caress on my cheek some time ago... I thought it to be a trick of the wind, but I think it was a message from my father.
I hope one day I'll convince Rustleif to take us back there. Until then, I'm content running the forge together here in Dawnstar.
I keep to myself. I offer spells and scrolls to those who need them, and wisdom in Conjuration magic for those who wish to learn.
I know plenty of spells that produce light, but stars? Hmm. There was that problem a few years ago, but that couldn't be related.
I love Kodlak. I respect and follow him. But he's wrong on this. It's no curse. We're made into the greatest hunters in the land.
I respect Eorlund, but he has the good fortune to work the Skyforge. Something about the fires... their steel just holds tighter.
I spent almost ten years at High Hrothgar, learning the Way of the Voice. Then the Great War came... I couldn't stand missing it.
I studied there myself. Had to leave over a misunderstanding with a headmistress. Well, more a misunderstanding with her husband.
I... I cannot deny the truth of what you say. Erik is all the family that I have left, but it's wrong to hold him back as I have.
I'll look for you, friend, when at last you return to Shor's hall. The honor will be ours when you rejoin the ranks of Sovngarde.
I'll take control of the family on my own time, Betrid. Until then, my brother remains in charge and you'll keep your mouth shut.
I'm only a humble acolyte, though. If you wish to avail yourself of Mara's blessing, you should speak with Dinya Balu or Maramal.
I'm the Jarl's uncle. He, his father, and I, swore oaths to the Empire to abandon Talos, as conditions of our return to the city.
I've always wanted to make a pilgrimage here to the Temple of Mara. Thank you for bringing me here... you've made me quite happy.
I've been pouring over the plans you brought us, and I'm convinced the Eyes of the Falmer are in the dwarven ruins at Irkngthand.
I've spent most of my life as a trader. I've got a stake in several shipping ventures across Tamriel, mostly imports and exports.
If you're heading east, steer clear of Hillgrund's Tomb. Thing about those old crypts - the dead having trouble staying that way.
If you're looking for a handout, you'll want to speak with my husband. If you're looking for company, I suppose I could do worse.
In fact, If you collected parts of the Edda from any Bard you encountered in your travels I would be willing to pay you for them.
In the old tales, Nord heroes would use the power of their Voice to Shout down the gates of cities and strike down their enemies.
It seems to be spreading from the southeast, down in the Jeralls near Riften. The one at Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds.
It's easy to find things to sell. Things nobody will miss. Things from underground, or just left lying around in someone's house.
It's the only thing I've even heard of that could cut Eldergleam. Stick it in, give it a twist, and the stuff will just flow out.
King Olaf was Olaf One-Eye? He famously captured the dragon Numinex and took him to Dragonsreach. What do we say really happened?
Kynesgrove. There's an ancient dragon burial near there. If we can get there before it happens, maybe we'll learn how to stop it.
Legend says this tomb holds a treasure that bestows great power on the one who discovers it. Beyond that, not much more is known.
Let's go talk with her. Stay close. Talk of assassins has the guards jumpy. They might attack you if you're not standing near me.
Look. Everyone in the Guild admires what you've done. Maybe they won't come out and simply tell you, but I promise you it's true.
Mages in Cyrodiil are all about politics. The Synod and the College of Whispers are too busy guarding secrets to bother to teach.
Magic is... frowned upon in Skyrim. Only the mages at the College of Winterhold teach it freely. If you wish to learn, join them.
Magic. That's what they always want. Never history. Never the secrets of the lost races. No, just little spells and enchantments.
My family was convinced coming here was a death sentence, or worse. It took years of insisting that this is what I'm meant to do.
My husband. We used to go out in the wilds and collect ingredients together. He used to call me his [QUOTE]pretty Juniper.[QUOTE]
My servants serve their own purposes. But, if their will is insufficient, nor suitably aligned with mine, I simply destroy them. 
Next thing you know, there'll be more guards, and then we'll lose our homes as well. This is just the start of it, mark my words.
No, no girl. It's the pickled spider tongue and then the decayed taproot. Do it the other way, and your cure turns into a poison.
Now then. The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I wish to honor you, Dragonborn and the truest of Stormcloaks.
Observing and capturing the epic struggle for Skyrim! When brothers clash with bitter blades, surely there is a song to be found.
Of course, I've been also dabbling in my old pastimes as well. Take a look around, and feel free to share the fruits of my labor.
Of course. Every night I pray that we don't get a visit from a dragon, or that two armies don't show up to fight over the bridge.
Oh, I am so happy for you! My, what a burden to have carried. But you've done it! You've conquered your own inner demons! Bravo! 
Oh, I tell the future, all right. When I feel up to the task, that is. But I'm afraid my energies haven't quite peaked yet today.
Oh, that. Err, yes. It's... It's quite promising, I believe. Definitely on the right track. Results, err, results should be soon.
Old Elven fella named Calcelmo is up in Understone Keep's the one you want to talk to for more about that. Wrote all those books.
One of my customers? Did you know I inherited the store from my late husband? Shame what happened to him. He had such good taste.
One of the ingredients I need to cultivate nirnroot are jazbay grapes... the acidic content of the juice is perfect for the soil.
One of them stole my Moon Amulet, given to me by my mother when I was just a cub. It is my only memory of home in this cold land.
Or if you're looking for training, we've got plenty of it down here. Delvin, Vex, Niruin and Vipir can give you a leg up on that.
Pretty angry actually. I can't believe I botched the Goldenglow job. That should have been like stealing a sweetroll from a baby.
Regardless, I'm making you a very simple offer. You get me the staff, and I give you Onmund's precious amulet. Do we have a deal?
Remember, composure and speed. You don't need to see your arrow hit before moving onto your next target. Trust your shot is true.
Rorik fought for the Empire in the Great War. He was gravely wounded, and so was brought before me. I was a healer then, you see.
Sadly, he's now lost in the soul-snaring mist - defeat Alduin, and his doom avert - I hope to greet him in this Hall as a friend.
So I took his advice, and here I am. This life might not look like much to you, but I'm content, and isn't that all that matters?
So long as your criminal past stays in the past, and you fight for me with honor and integrity, we'll welcome you into our ranks.
So polite! So nice! Cicero likes you. The Night Mother is sure to like you too. Oh, we're going to be fast friends. Fast friends.
So you know what it's like to have your life in someone else's hands. Why should they get to decide? Isn't judgment for the gods?
Sometimes, when she goes to her room to work or sleep, I slip out for a bit. Noontime, every day - that's when I hit the streets.
Speak to Filnjar in Shor's Stone. He's got some sort of ore sample he wants us to identify and was willing to pay us well for it.
Strange. According to history Solitude attacked Winterhold, but Aesgeir seems to be saying Olaf reacted. What do we say happened?
Taking care of the entire hold is another matter entirely. It would be a big enough job without the war on and the dragons about.
Tell me, son. Any truth to these stories I been hearing. About you gluing a cow's udders shut? You really do something like that?
That's impossible. I distinctly heard that lout in the tavern say it was a full shipment of furs. They should be worth a fortune.
The Blades were born of dragon-hating crusaders. They still carry that legacy although they may not remember from whence it came.
The Empire's elven puppetmasters never cared much for the idea of a human becoming a divine. So the worship of Talos is outlawed.
The honey they collect on that hunk of rock goes into making Black-Briar Mead; just about the best tasting mead in all of Skyrim.
The Legion's always looking for strong, capable warriors. If you think you've got what it takes, our headquarters is in Solitude.
The only thing I need to do, dear wife, is make sure profits are up, no matter what. If Thongvor won't do the dirty work, I will.
The only way this place will ever return to its glory days is if we can finish these extra jobs and start the gold flowing again.
The people of Skyrim don't like magic much, so about the only place you're likely to find a teacher is the College of Winterhold.
Their connections to the Empire and the Legion are well-known. When Thorald didn't return home, there was no question in my mind.
Then you have Hemming, Maven's son; spoiled brat and heir to her empire. He follows her word like a loyal dog follows its master.
There's too much of an obsession these days with knives and arrows. You can kill someone just as easily with a well-placed spell.
Think of her as a scolding mother continually pushing you harder to be successful; outwardly sounding angry but silently content.
This here's Rorikstead. Quiet place. Good people, though. You can get a room and a mug at the Frostfruit Inn if you care to stay.
Those caravaners can be an elusive bunch. Takes a fair bit of stalking to take one down. But then, that's half the fun, isn't it?
Those kids are dead anyway. Killing me won't bring them back. I, on the other hand, have done quite a bit with my time on Mundus.
Those thieves must be mad, hiding out there. Those old crypts are filled with nothing but traps, trolls, and who knows what else!
To the east of here is a hidden grove where the Eldergleam resides. It's the oldest living thing in Skyrim. Maybe all of Tamriel.
Wait just a moment. The blue thing. Yes, yes, yes! I can see your point. Draw out the necessary energies using a Jarol Apparatus!
We get the occasional pilgrim passing through here on their way to the summit, but almost all of them have returned disappointed.
We promised a group of Nord militia free worship in exchange for their help retaking the Hold. Then the Elves found out about it.
We respect the old ways, the Nord ways, an' a Gray-Mane has worked the Skyforge since before the time of my grandfather's father.
We took you in, didn't we? We would be glad to extend our welcome to any other who showed your dedication. What more could we do?
What, then, of this Glamoril? It means [QUOTE]secret of life[QUOTE] in elvish. Could this be an explanation for Shalidor's works?
When I am become wolf, I am treachery incarnate. And then, then... there is no one who can stand between the hunter and his prey.
When you have completed your count of days, I may welcome you again, with glad friendship, and bid you join the blessed feasting.
Why would anyone bother to study stars? Well, unless you're talking about that artifact that got all those... dimwits thrown out.
Winterhold was ancient and weathered, but it couldn't withstand the sea's fury. Entire districts of the city were lost overnight.
With the passing of my dear husband Torygg, the weighty position of Jarl has fallen to me. Please direct questions to my Steward.
Without you this would have been a disaster. I should have paid more heed to Varnius' warnings.  I won't make that mistake again.
Yep. She said that the Jarl was planning a surprise raid on us, but she talked her out of it. Said she saved us a lot of trouble.
Yes. I set you up. I wanted you dead. I betrayed you, the Night Mother, and everything I hold dear. And now Maro has betrayed me.
You can only store white souls in the Star, belonging to the lesser creatures. Azura's magic won't allow black souls to enter it.
You do realize these simpletons wouldn't know real music if it bit them in the britches, hmm? Very well. Your wish is my command.
You know very well what I'm talking about. You're saying that I only married Bolli for his gold and that I don't really love him.
You know, I'm beginning to respect you. Other than Aerin, you seem to be the only other person I've met I might be able to trust.
You met at the full moon, under the biggest tree in Witchmist Grove, surrounded by fireflies. It was straight out of a storybook.
You tell him that jester is up to no good, and he'll deal with it. Then come back here, and I'll toss a few coins your way, yeah?
You'll be doing whatever Rikke tells you to do. And, I expect you to find creative ways to disrupt the Stormcloaks along the way.
Your meddling above ground reminded me of how removed I've been from the struggle. My men and I should be in the hills, fighting.
A few mortals are born with similar abilities -- whether a gift or a curse has been a matter of debate down through the centuries.
Across the river to the northeast lies Yngol Barrow. Steer clear of that foul place, lest the walking dead claim you as their own.
Actually, I was just wondering if you could make sure people are tended to if they get hurt. I'm sure you wouldn't object to that.
Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in all your... endeavors.
Ah, the prophecy. Be wary of prophecy. Some are meant as a guide. Some as a warning. Are you sure you can tell one from the other?
Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like most of my kind you'll find in Skyrim, that's for damned sure.
All it takes is one taste, and the effects are quite immediate. The Emperor will be serving Sithis before he even knows he's dead.
Alright... here you go. Should keep you light on your feet, and hold up decent enough if you wind up trading blows with the enemy.
And so he came before my husband and he... he shouted. With that terrible voice. Like something out of a legend... Or a nightmare.
Anything! Anything at all that might be of interest. That's why I adore this location... we have no idea what we're going to find.
Are you sure that's the real reason? It wouldn't have anything to do with others making an Argonian unwelcome, because if it is...
As part of their [QUOTE]duties,[QUOTE] the priests created all sorts of baseless rituals and ceremonies all on Nocturnal's behalf.
At this time, there is no indication that, as has been rumored, the object is in fact a physical part of Magnus, the god of magic.
Because the Dominion is a sleeping beast that Skyrim cannot slay alone. Because many Nords are part of the Imperial army even now.
Being Guild Master means more than just getting a cut of all the loot, it's about being a leader and keeping this rabble in order.
Both sides want to tell you how you should live your life. Guess I'd rather hear it from a real Nord than some Emperor down south.
But going forward, I'm sure you realize that your fate is in your own hands. And the law can not be bent for personal friendships.
But I do not and will not approve of any research or experiments that cause purposeful harm to your fellow members of the College.
But no matter how poorly they may have treated me, they're still my family. I didn't consider that until after I'd made the trade.
But this is all so much to take in. I need time to read the letter, and figure out where we go from here. And this amulet. Hmmm...
But... who exactly are you? And why are you in here? I think it best you leave Mzinchaleft. These ruins can be quite... dangerous.
Can it be? You've brought me my amulet? Oh, thank Arkay. And thank you. Oh, dear friend, please, take this gold for your troubles.
Chin up, Ungrien! Remember, you have a roof over your head and food in your belly thanks to the very same Dark Elves. Be thankful.
Cicero will cite our independence as the need to revert to the Old Ways. He'll claim we're undisciplined, unruly. Heretical, even.
Dagon's Mythic Dawn cult killed the Septim Dynasty and opened the Oblivion Gates into Tamriel. They called it the Oblivion Crisis.
Do you realize when the orcs attacked, I was only concerned with myself? I fled... and left my brothers and sisters behind to die.
Dragonsreach occupies the highest, which we call the Cloud District. From here, the Jarl can see all that goes on within his city.
Esbern should be able to help. He's spent his whole life poring over every old book he could find about dragons and that prophecy.
Even I cannot see past Time's ending to what comes next. Niid koraav zeim dinoksetiid. We must do the best we can with this world.
Even though Nocturnal doesn't desire worship in the traditional sense, the Twilight Sepulcher propagated a small group of priests.
Eventually, the Star will fade back into my realm in Oblivion, but I doubt you have the hundred or so years it would take to wait.
Fascinating! So the ancients were more daring... or foolhardy... similar to the Dragon Break itself, although less far-reaching...
For your sake, I hope you're right. Because if it is you, and Maven finds out, the Dreth family is going to be one member smaller.
Glad your here, I've been looking for some more merchandise to buy. Have lots of orders to fill and my clients don't like to wait.
Good timing. The people in this home recently got one of your fellow Guild mates sent to jail. How about you make them pay for it.
Ha. We'll see. I do have my eye on her, but she seemed a bit cold when I spoke to her earlier. Maybe just playing hard to get, eh?
Hafrumph! Well then, if you're going to be like that... Perhaps it's best I take my leave. A good day to you sir. I said good day!
He fed his entire family with the gold he made using that weapon. I'm not about to let it gather dust in some thief's trophy room.
He's probably hoping I'll refuse so he can blame the Empire for being unreasonable. I think I'll have to disappoint him yet again.
Here you are. Now remember, people in Skyrim respond to deeds. You will find more people interested in your love if you help them.
Here, take this bag of supplies. At the top of the steps you'll see the offering chest. Just leave the bag inside and you're done.
Hmph. All right, then. Go. Go, my Listener. Find out what that slimy bastard Motierre has to say, then send the Emperor to Sithis.
Hold on, you've given me a brilliant idea. Just as calipers hold materials in place, a soul siphon can hold magic fields in place.
Hold your breath if you're superstitious. We're passing Shroud Hearth Barrow. Everyone knows spirits guard the old treasure there.
I actually advise the Jarl on political matters. My input is invaluable, of course. But this is all probably a bit over your head.
I also do a little herb growing. The court wizard, Wuunferth, pays us to plant a little Nightshade. Who knows what he uses it for?
I don't believe so. But I'll be able to instruct you further after you've returned from the chamber. It depends on what you learn.
I enjoy this work well enough, but I'm ready to retire. I've been thinking of selling the inn to Ysolda. Anyway, what do you need?
I may understand things here in Skyrim better than the General, but I'm a soldier at heart, not a politician. But I'll do my best.
I respectfully disagree, sir. Stendarr and Zenithar may demand strength from them, but Mara and Dibella demand compassion from us.
I think the man you want to talk to is Nelacar. He was exiled a few years ago, bad research. Still hangs around the Frozen Hearth.
I think the time might be right for another public appearance. Maybe address the patrons at the Bannered Mare? Or visit Jorrvaskr?
I truly hope that these points actually sink in, and that more care and thought is given to this subject in the future. Thank you.
I trust his judgment on this. As a priest of Arkay he's had to deal with necromancy before. Nothing as dangerous as Potema though.
I want to begin stockpiling food and water in the event we come under siege, and I would like you to oversee this work personally.
I was walking by the old Aretino Residence, heard the little boy, Aventus? He was chanting. It was the Black Sacrament, I tell ya.
I wonder if we'll come across some bandits who've just finished roasting a rabbit on a spit. Maybe they'll have a keg of ale, too.
I'll be the judge of that. Besides, by all reports the Stormcloaks are suffering just as much as we are from these dragon attacks.
I'm glad they finally believed me. About the assassin I mean. It's been so hard since my Torygg passed. No one takes me seriously.
I'm sending you to Serpentstone Island. If you survive, you pass. If you die, well, you weren't going to be much use to me anyway.
I'm sure that will be a great comfort to the families of your comrades who died to free the land you just gave back to the Empire.
I'm trying, but Ulfric is set in his ways. For him, there's two kinds of people in this world -- Nords, and the folk beneath them.
I've been a Nightingale for a very long time. I sold my allegiance to Nocturnal in exchange for many profitable years of thieving.
I've heard him boasting at the Bannered Mare, saying he'll [QUOTE]conquer me as a true Nord conquers any harsh beast.[QUOTE] Hmph.
I've sent some men to scout out the area. Meet them, see if you can't find a way to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort.
I've spent the last few decades living in regret and seeking redemption from Mara. And by Her Benevolence, I will right my wrongs.
If you'll pardon me now, my crew needs gathering. Should be in Hammerfell before the other Horkers know who let slip their secret.
In exchange for Riften, the jewel of Skyrim? Hardly. How about the Reach? Gaining control of the silver mines would be invaluable.
In joining the Legion, you'll be taking an oath binding you to the service of the Emperor and thus to every citizen of the Empire.
Indeed I have, sir. Elven weapons for their armies, sir. Elven material, but poor workmanship, like most of what we get from them.
It is a lonely thing, facing all the dangers of Skyrim by yourself. Come and find me if you decide that you miss my companionship.
It started slowly at first. Malyn would see things that weren't there. Then he would yell at students over words they hadn't said.
It's a wonderful house, my love. If you don't mind, I'm going to start a small store. Something to do whenever you're on the road.
It's Cicero. Ever since he arrived, his behavior's been... Well, erratic would be an understatement. I do believe he is truly mad.
It's not just the work, it's everything about her. She's disgusting. I think she takes her worship of Dibella a bit too seriously.
Just be careful. Casting wards requires constant concentration, and you can easily find yourself drained of your magicka reserves.
Laila is a simple and traditional woman. Which makes it easy to manipulate her, but impossible to regain her graces once offended.
Lately it seems I am more nurse than priestess, tending to those who have suffered, both in mind and body, from this terrible war.
Legend has it that the crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and is said to increase the power of the wearer.
Make your way to our hidden camp in the Rift. I can't continue to push forward when I'm worried about Eastmarch's southern border.
Me? Nothing. And I hope to keep it that way. The Jarl is convinced I have some connection with the College, so he goes easy on me.
My brother takes council from Proventus Avenicci? What a laugh. He takes council from his daughter, and she's a bloody blacksmith.
Namira, the Lady of Decay, accepts you for what you are. She has a place for us, where we can sate our appetites without judgment.
No, he went into the forbidden wing of the palace, to speak with an old friend. Said it had been ages since they had last had tea.
No! Don't pity me. I deserve whatever fate the Dread Lord has in store. I betrayed you... and now Maro has betrayed me. Fitting...
None know its origins, but the stories say that men who hear its music are compelled to dance uncontrollably, no matter the peril.
Nothing at all. It's very... nice. If you want something with a little more style, however, you should see what we have available.
Now my mother's stripped me of my heritage and incarcerated me here like a common criminal and my brother has all but disowned me.
Now, by law and tradition, I can only grant the title to one who is known throughout Eastmarch, and who owns property in Windhelm.
Oh, Cicero takes care of our Lady's body. Oils it, preserves it, keeps it safe. Makes sure nobody disrespects our Matron's coffin.
Oh, I know. I know. But I'm so glad you're here. Please, allow me to state my business. Surely your time is as valuable as my own.
Oh, it's much better than that. I will teach you how to breathe underwater, with no need to turn into one of those ugly creatures.
Oh, yes... spices. That was a special order for someone in Whiterun. Should be along any day now. Don't let it worry you, my dear.
Okay, I think this door should lead to the main burial chamber where Vals is holed up. Let's get in there and put and end to this.
Only that they break an old woman's heart. So many friends, so many kin, all lost trying to rebuild a past that was over long ago.
Over the years I've heard things. Powerful magics lost to the ages, incredible spells that only the most skilled mages can master.
Paarthurnax was the author of many atrocities during the Dragon War - crimes great enough to be remembered for thousands of years.
She trusts you, at least to some extent. She sent you after us, and has no reason to think that you'd do anything other than that.
She's locked herself in her room not letting anyone in. Well, except for us servants. She's afraid of assassins coming to get her.
Sister dear, could you try sewing those sleeves a little tighter? We can't have our customers looking sloppy because of your work.
So fine, trudge off to Labyrinthian in search of your Staff. I shall return to Cyrodiil and deliver my full report to the Council.
So you meet me at Fallowstone Cave, and we'll get this over with. I can have my tribe back, and you can... You can leave us alone.
Stop yammering and keep your eyes peeled. They could be here at any moment. If I were them I'd come straight here, sword swingin'!
Take the last trade we did. Some Fine-Cut Void Salts from the College of Winterhold. Plenty of coin if you know who to sell it to.
Thank you for telling me the truth. Could you talk to Faendal, as well?  I'm sure he'll want to thank you for standing up for him.
That's not how things work around here. The Guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly.
The best we can hope for a swift end to the conflict. The longer the war goes on, the worse it will be for all for us, I'm afraid.
The contract is for the male, Hern. But you'll probably have to contend with the female, too. So for Sithis' sake, watch yourself.
The fool went absolutely berserk! He wounded Veezara, tried to kill me, and then he fled. I knew that lunatic couldn't be trusted.
The Jarl has put out a bounty on the dragon that's been terrorizing the countryside. Here, take a look at this decree for details.
The lass seems to think old Mercer is pulling a fast one on us... leading us here and letting the dwarven constructs wear us down.
The last thing you need is my help. Listener or not, you've proven yourself time and again. To Astrid, to the Family... and to me.
The Mage Light spell is useful to any mage, not just those specializing in Alteration. Can you cast one on the seal on the ground?
The meadery has quite a pest problem and the whole city knows about it. Pest poison and mead don't mix well, you know what I mean?
The problem is that it'll be a little difficult to acquire, seeing as how it's in the hands of someone who isn't exactly friendly.
The stone structure the Dwarves have left makes us invincible. Let the dragons singe a few carpets. They'll never topple Markarth.
The Thalmor. We're very old enemies. And if my suspicions are correct, they might have something to do with the dragons returning.
Then it's true, what everyone is saying? That Aventus Aretino is doing the Black Sacrament? Trying to summon the Dark Brotherhood?
Then... it is true! She is back! Our Lady is back! She has chosen a Listener! She has chosen you! Ha ha ha! All hail the Listener!
There's a mass of the Falmer in this chamber. We can sneak through or take them down... I don't care. As long as we get to Mercer.
There's an evil to the north, friend, and its name is Ragnvald. A tomb like so many in Skyrim, where the dead have found no peace.
These look like good quality, too. I know it's not the glamorous, heroic work, but don't be surprised if I ask you to do it again.
They ended up sacking the Imperial City. I was there, blasting apart young Elven men and women with Fireballs and Lightning Bolts.
They pay us next to nothing. We get beaten if we make a mistake, and where are our kind Nord rulers? What are they doing? Typical.
This situation with the sewers beneath the city. I hear people have entered this place and have gone missing. Do you know of this?
This store would finally be on its feet if I hadn't lost my last shipment to Forsworn attacks. A specially-made Dibella statuette.
This... it matches every description of the Phial that I've found in lore. But if it can't hold liquid, there's no way of knowing.
Very well, Thongvor. With the Stormcloaks here to help, the Silver-Blood family control nearly every route in and out of the city.
We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever soldiers he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt.
We really must discuss the security here in Dragonsreach. Perhaps we could limit patrols in the city, and retain more guards here?
We should take Hjaalmarch. It'll be an important pressure point on the Imperials. We'd be within spitting distance of the capital.
We've actually stolen this item before and somehow it ended up back in some other mark's house. Guess it's time to reclaim it, eh?
We've lost more clients in the last decade than I'd care to count, but Maven's stuck with us through throughout the entire ordeal.
Well it was, up until the point where we set foot outside. The house was surrounded by town guard... the client had ratted us out.
Well, after I fled Morrowind during the eruption, I made my way here... my family had purchased this farm and its all we had left.
Well, I'm just surprised the Gourmet is a Redguard. I had you pegged for a Wood Elf, honestly. You know, because of your use of...
Well, she finds out and she tells her brother, Wulfur. Then her brother attacks me with a knife... I mean, I had to defend myself!
What? What treachery! Defiler! Debaser and defiler! You have violated the sanctity of the Night Mother's coffin! Explain yourself!
What's the Legion doing here? Damn Imperial spies... Well, should be fun for us, at least. They don't seem to know we're here yet.
When I got close, the mercenaries Aringoth hired to protect the estate just waved me off. I don't think he wants visitors anymore.
When you Shout, you speak in the language of dragons. Thus, your Dragon Blood gives you an inborn ability to learn Words of Power.
Yeah, well, don't expect many more stories like that in my future. I'm getting old. Being that amazing takes too much damn effort.
Yes, I've heard such things. Anuriel assures me they're just fabrications and there's nothing down there save a few stray skeever.
Yes, indeed. The only thing I can tell you is that the mold was taken to the bandit's hideout... a small cottage called Pinewatch.
You gave those mongrels a real whipping, eh? Good work. We'll be sure to send a garrison to reinforce the area and keep the peace.
You go report our success. I'll set up a garrison here. A shame none of the prisoners made it, but their names will be remembered.
You keep pledging more and more of our guard to the frontlines. The way this is going, we won't be able to defend our own borders.
You know, you're a fun person to drink with. I know this great little place where the wine flows like water. We should head there.
You'll need to speak with Mirabelle Ervine. Her quarters are in the Hall of Countenance, but she could be anywhere on the grounds.
A man's heart is his own burden to bear, so I will honor your request, though it casts a bit of gloom on an otherwise glorious day.
Ah, indeed. Well there's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. I'm sure you'll manage, though.
Any fool can just flail about, swinging his weapon as fast as he can. Any fool can die. Keep your guard up and wait for an opening.
Aye, that I do. I've got to, if I hope to be as good as Eorlund Gray-Mane some day. In fact, I just finished my best piece of work.
Besides, I'd rather die with some of Mercer's blood on my blade than spend the rest of my life regretting that I ran the other way.
Bit of advice, folks here don't care for magic or those that use it. If you're intent on it, check at the College up in Winterhold.
But I don't want to be safe! I'm not afraid of the dangers out there. The only thing I'm afraid of is wasting my life on this farm.
But J'zargo works so hard, there is no time to test these new spells. If you help with the testing, this will make learning easier.
But they've got a treasure in there. Gold statue, size of a child. Who knows what they use it for, but I know what I'll use it for.
By Akatosh, all the blood. The smell of flesh burned and pulled apart by magic. I never want to do that to another soul ever again.
By all means, let's hear it. It's the least I could do, since you already helped me grant one final wish for my last worshippers...
Could you... could you give her this letter, and say it's from Sven? I think I've matched that Nord's lack of cleverness perfectly.
Damn it, woman, I'm the Jarl of Whiterun! I won't apologize for talking to my people. You can't protect me every moment of the day.
Deathbell grow in the frozen tundra. You might nip into a mine for the ruby and silver. Vampire Dust is tricky. Vampires, you know.
Dorthe, dear, I've been growin' some really lovely vegetables. Maybe tomorrow you could help me plant a new patch? What do you say?
Enough, Maramal. We've all heard of the dragons and their return. There's no need to use them as an excuse to harass our customers.
Even if your opponent doesn't have a shield, those big, powerful blows can stagger him. Leaves him open for a quick follow up blow.
Failure to do so will result in paying, in Urag's words, [QUOTE]a blood price.[QUOTE] I did not ask him to elaborate on that point.
For the moment we have ceased hostilities. We'll see what these Imperials have to say. I doubt we'll come to any lasting agreement.
Glory is meaningless if they have no home to return to. I urge you to lower our commitments to the front until I'm sure we're safe.
Good. Maybe he's realized he's beaten. The way things are going, we'll be knocking at the gates of Solitude itself before too long.
Hanse was in line to be High King of Skyrim, you know. Having that might get the ear of the other Holds and give me some authority.
Have you met Rorik? He owns these lands, and it's from him that our village gets its name. We have been friends for many years now.
He holed himself up in Labyrinthian, and devoted all of his time to research and study. Wrote more than you would imagine possible.
He is also a vampire. My family is entrusted with keeping him buried, but recently someone stole the wardstone, and Vighar escaped.
He is not compelled to come, but the dov are prideful by nature. Few could resist such a challenge. Especially from you, Dovahkiin.
He made the mistake of supporting the Stormcloaks, and it cost him. Bitter news for his family, but a fate they should've expected.
He said I attacked someone! On the road! But it never happened. Never. Sweet mother and I were just waiting. My knife was sheathed!
He's dangerous. Very dangerous. A rogue Dark Elf mage doing research into Dwarven artifacts should be both respected... and feared.
Here, keep it. You are as much a part of its legend now as Curalmil was. I hope it brings you the happiness that my master desired.
Here, let me give you a particularly venomous letter. Say it's from Faendal. That should get Camilla to stop inviting the elf over.
Hjaalmarch isn't much, but it's a good start. I'll make a name for myself here, then maybe work my way up to someplace like Riften.
I make no secret of it. I don't care if the Empire controls the city or not, I won't hide my loyalty to the dream of a free Skyrim.
I misplaced it in the catacombs. I'd look for it, but I've been hearing noises down there. I fear the dead have become... restless.
I offered him a stay from execution if he used his influence to deal with any annoyances that came up. Competitors, agents, idiots.
I pray Talos overlooks our less than honorable approach. But he knows our purpose is just and true. I'm glad you made it out alive.
I saw what they did to Gallus. I wanted to use the Guild's resources to hunt down Karliah. The others didn't even care he was gone.
I think the Bards College might be looking for recruits. You should speak to the head of the college, Viarmo, if you're interested.
I think there are some things that... oh, wait. Are you trying to trick me? You are not a full-blood yet. We can't talk about that.
I try to include her in my lessons from Maramal over at the Temple of Mara, but she prefers to shop instead. Different strokes, eh?
I was recruited as an acolyte of Vaermina as a young elf. I had no real childhood to speak of... we weren't permitted to socialize.
I wished you could have sent more of a message to those Summerset Shadows upstarts, but hopefully they'll stay out of our business.
I'll count to three and then say [QUOTE]go.[QUOTE] You have ten seconds to hit each of the four targets. Draw string and get ready.
I'll prove it to you, all right? I'll get you the letter. Just... meet me at the statue of Talos, and don't tell anyone about this.
I'm afraid I had to pay off a few officials to keep you out of jail, boss. Expensive to get murder off the books, know what I mean?
I'm afraid so. I'm weakening, and I can feel myself slipping away. The years without restoration of my power have taken their toll.
I've checked with my court and apparently you're fully eligible... there's nothing standing in the way of presenting you the title.
I've never seen anything like it. I would take this to Calixto at the House of Curiosities. He has a good eye for strange trinkets.
If there was someone else Ulfric could trust with all this planning nonsense, I'd be out there breaking heads with the rest of you.
If you're here about the mine -- it's already got an owner, and she's not selling. If not, then please stay out of my workers' way.
In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see!
Indeed. You don't get to the position my mother's achieved by blind luck... her business sense and diplomatic skills are legendary.
Is this your tale of single-handedly fighting off a pack of trolls or my favorite... where you bedded four women on the same night?
It doesn't really matter what I believe, now does it? I've brought you someone who can protect you. That's what you want, isn't it?
It was little more than a chaotic uprising, but the Reach was removed from Imperial authority for two years before we reclaimed it.
It was the Forsworn, wasn't it? I lose dozens of shipments every season to those barbarians. Now they're in the city? Gods help us.
It's just that, well I'm not even really sure it's going to amount to anything just yet. All theoretical right now, you understand.
Jarl wants it to look like an ancient blade. High Queen Freydis ruled over Windhelm in the Second Era, and her sword was legendary.
Just a man's life work, is all. I've finally derived the location of the White Phial, but this doting busybody won't let me get it.
Maven wants this mark's most prized possession. The bloody fool carries it on his person all the time. So, think you can handle it?
Meet the brothers preparing for the attack. Then join them in wiping out the Imperials. Once you prevail we will garrison the fort.
My advice? Serve your time at the pickaxe and get out. You don't want to end up getting a shiv in the guts over a bottle of Skooma.
My brother Jon had the right of it - join the Bards College and avoid this pointless war. Too bad he died before he had the chance.
My past is long and storied, and not altogether proud. But the Dark Brotherhood saved me from myself. And I have never looked back.
My wife and I think there's some dark magic at work. Or perhaps Arkay's influence is strong here, and he likes to keep it this way.
No one can escape his hunger, here or in the afterlife! Alduin will devour all things and the world will end. Nothing can stop him!
No, though you may be the last. The one who calls himself Ancano has sought my knowledge as well, through very different questions.
Once you have been rewarded for my assassination, I want you to kill the very person who ordered it. Would you do me this kindness?
Plenty of people here that need Eorlund's craftsmanship, my dear. We've never had any reason to deal with those caravans of theirs.
Ro means [QUOTE]Balance[QUOTE] in the dragon tongue. Combine it with Fus - [QUOTE]Force[QUOTE] - to focus your Thu'um more sharply.
So if one of them says they're going to do something, I believe them. When you can just take what you want, there's no need to lie.
So rise up! Rise up, children of the Empire! Rise up, Stormcloaks! Embrace the word of mighty Talos, he who is both man and Divine!
So when they did find out, it was either we arrest Ulfric and the militia, or enter into yet another war with the Aldmeri Dominion.
Son, I know thousands of the old ballads. If I played all of them, everyone in this inn would be as grey as I am before I finished.
Speak with the Corrupt Agent at the Penitus Oculatus Outpost, in Dragon Bridge. Accept his gold, then kill the target. Hail Sithis!
The College will continue to research these intriguing objects, and of course any findings will be relayed with all possible haste.
The entire town is being plagued by horrible nightmares. They're in serious danger but I'm afraid there's little I can do about it.
The Midden remains off-limits at this time; while the initial outbreak has been cleaned up, the area is still considered hazardous.
The Night Mother would communicate this to the Listener, who would then dispatch a Speaker to arrange the contract with the client.
The owner of this place just got an inheritance from a relative lost in the war. Sound like something you can sink your teeth into?
The self-loathing enhances Pelagius' anger! Ah, but his confidence will shrink with every hit. You must bring the two into balance.
The Stormcloaks are destined to win this fight. Talos is with us, and when you fight under a Divine's blessing, victory is assured.
Then you know that Gourmet keeps his identity a secret. I'm hoping to discover who he is, so I can tell him how he changed my life.
There's Treva's Watch. I hear bandits moved in while the steward was off fighting the war. I wonder if he ever got that sorted out?
They are profane creatures with no hope of redemption. They lure innocents to their deaths and corrupt the souls of all they touch.
Thinking of settling in? There's a house for sale - Breezehome. You should talk to the steward up in the keep if you're interested.
This changes everything, of course. There's no time to lose. We must locate...  let me show you. I know I had it here, somewhere...
This house of yours is wondrous, at least to these eyes. I've thought about starting a store. Something to do here when you're out.
Those robes were worn during the Mythic Dawn's secret meetings, where they plotted to bring the Daedra Mehrunes Dagon into Tamriel.
Turn me in? For what? What crime's been committed? I'm just making idle talk about what would most undoubtedly be a tragic event...
Unfortunately Morthal is still in danger. The journal mentions Movarth, a powerful master vampire that I had assumed was destroyed.
Unfortunately, the future is as obscured to us as it is to you. The overwhelming power of the Eye makes it difficult for us to see.
Well, as this is the first time this has happened, I'll make it very clear that the College does not condone that sort of behavior.
Well, more like the public reception. It should be a lovely affair. You'll mingle with the guests, eat some cake... stab the bride.
What an amazing day this has been. I hope you're enjoying the festivities. I'm... I'm just so overwhelmed. Such kindness... for me.
What else do you want from me? I've already told you everything. Listen, if you let me go I can take you to Riften, show you where-
What kind of cruel, horrible person are you? My sister was murdered. Do you have any idea what that's like? What I'm going through?
What? I didn't... hmm? No, listen, you must have misunderstood... I don't mean to say I wouldn't be interested... what I mean is...
When I came here, my only duties were to cure crop diseases and occasionally light a bonfire on holidays. I didn't sign up to kill.
When we get back to Cyrodiil, I swear I will hire an army of battlemages to come up here and set fire to the whole damned province.
Why should I bother? I've already made a bunch of coin off of his shipment, so anything else I squeeze out of him would be a bonus.
Yes, the school of Illusion can be quite influential. Kings have risen to power because of it, and empires have been razed with it.
Yes, you see, the thing is... I'm not concerned with [QUOTE]everyone's best interest.[QUOTE] I find I'm only concerned with my own.
You are going to brew a new batch of ale, right? Like we talked about? What we have's been sitting in that barrel for over a month.
You are guilty of insurrection, murder of Imperial citizens, the assassination of King Torygg, and high treason against the Empire.
You bring an outsider here, and now insist I call on Malacath for help, when he has clearly forsaken me? You try my patience, Atub.
You show up here just as our work nears completion, and now I can't get any results from this because of something at your College.
You take care of yourself, now. And if you ever find yourself in New Sheoth, do look me up. We can share a strawberry torte. Ta ta!
A bunch of lazy rabble trying to make a living. Can't get better workers in because everyone's afraid of the tomb up above the mine.
A sword? I remember a legend that Tiber Septim had attacked one of the enemy camps before he came to Old Hroldan. It could be there.
After, growing distrust of magic made life difficult for many. Some left rather than endure the growing hatred from the local Nords.
Ah, don't worry, we all like to break the rules sometimes. Just see Nazir and pay the fine. Seems I do that at least once a month...
Ah, well. Dead is dead. Right? My thanks to you, assassin. Here's the gold I was going to pay for the job. You earned it, after all.
Ah, yes. Hmm. Well, why don't you see if you can assist Arniel Gane? He's one of our scholars, here working on cataloging our finds.
Ah, yes. That scabbard. Notice the insignia? An Oblivion Gate. A key symbol of Mehrunes Dagon, the patron Daedra of the Mythic Dawn.
All I know is that the sap makes you feel as healthy as a cave troll, but slow as a drunk horker. And that and it fetches good coin.
All right. I won't deny it, child. What you heard is true. But Aventus Aretino walks a dark path. His actions can lead only to ruin.
And in that moment, the gods will look down and see Skyrim as she was meant to be. Full of Nords who are mighty, powerful, and free!
But people don't know that. So they still perform the ritual... and we eventually hear about it. When someone wants us, we find out.
But there are many Words of Power in Skyrim, carved in the Dragon tongue. Even from here, we can feel the Thu'um resonate from them.
But, I wouldn't go there if I were you. There's a whole group of them with axes and magic on their side. You'd never stand a chance.
But, if confronted with proof of his belief, you might be able to [QUOTE]persuade[QUOTE] him to aid our cause, indirectly of course.
Come to get yourself a kid? You're out of luck. No way Grelod will let any of us get adopted. Especially not since Aventus took off.
Didn't take much to prove myself and knock them into shape. Now every free blade from here to Windhelm wants to sign on for a piece.
Dinya, about that incense you requested? Its not arriving anytime soon. The Khajiit caravans are having tough times getting through.
Dragons have the inborn ability to learn and project their Voice. Dragons also are able to absorb the power of their slain brethren.
Edda... she's crazy as a loon, but at least she doesn't have the mind to realize what a horrible world this is. She's the lucky one.
Even here, where heroes throng, few can match this mighty deed. What glory! The gods themselves must envy us this well-earned honor!
Fine. You play in the mud, or play with your father's forge, or get into sword fights with your little friend. But this is not over.
First, there are ancient references to dragon [QUOTE]heartscales[QUOTE]. What little I could learn suggests they may be what I need.
Forsworn had taken over Markarth, and Ulfric and his men drove them out. Empire promised they'd be free to worship Talos afterwards.
Good day, Lemkil. I saw some nice dresses for your little girls while I was in Whiterun. I'd be happy to purchase them, if you like.
Good work. I'll send some men with a wagon to collect the prize. We can use the weapons here, and I'll pass on the coin to Solitude.
Good work. This was a double victory. We took a garrison away from the Stormcloaks and further proved the hollowness of their cause.
He's already dead. Worse, the enchantment keeping him intact requires black souls. I don't know how many people he must have killed.
However, as the head of the company it's my job to make sure we maintain good relationships with prospective partners and investors.
I am nobody's master, Vilkas. And last I checked, we had some empty beds in Jorrvaskr for those with a fire burning in their hearts.
I can't say I've been to Winterhold more than a handful of times. Can't see much reason most honest folk would want to come up here.
I don't know exactly what's going on here, if you're the Listener, or this is some fluke, or what. But what we now have before us...
I don't know for sure. I spoke out against the Aldmeri Dominion publicly; I suspect that's why these men were hired to hunt me down.
I fear I have already overstepped the bounds of my Order, but I will offer this: seek out the Augur of Dunlain here in your College.
I had a daughter, once. She'd be 23 this year. Married to some hot-headed silver worker or maybe on her own learning the herb trade.
I know you for what you are. This town's blood is ours. Leave it! Now we must return to our roles lest the sheep suspect the wolves.
I managed to sneak past the guards and get this far, but... I don't think I can go on. I'm no warrior! Please, can you look for her?
I promise you, the thought crossed my mind. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot.
I understand. But you're being paranoid. I'm inspecting security, not charging off into battle. There's not a lot that can go wrong.
I'm afraid that's it, my friend. I've done all I can. I hope the place is at least livable now. Good luck with, your, um... murders.
If Moon Sugar is refined properly, it can be used to make skooma, another substance that will knock you over after a single draught.
If you're ever looking to sell any illegally obtained merchandise, I'd also provide my services as a fence. It's the least I can do.
In any event, our anonymous chef shares a passion for food with all of Tamriel. And that anonymity will prove the Emperor's undoing.
It has been suggested that the object is a gateway to the realm of Aetherius, but nothing has proven that idea one way or the other.
Keep an eye out for Imperials. They still hold this entire region. As long as we don't do anything stupid... we should be all right.
Last I saw him, he was visiting a friend in the Blue Palace. But no one as mundane as the Jarl. No, no... such people are below him.
Let's see. Last time I used the Dwemer Spoon was at my dear friend Boti's house in Ivarstead... Fellstar Farm I believe it's called.
Look, I talked to the Jarl, the Steward, the Housecarl... everyone. They all told me their resources were spread too thin right now.
Madanach's guard. Big, even for an Orc. Heard he ripped a man's arm off and beat him to death with it. He's old-fashioned like that.
Murder is, obviously, a very serious crime, and a very high bounty will be put on your head in the hold where the act was committed.
My father was a Priest of Arkay. All my life was spent around the dead, being forced to learn the proper burial rituals and prayers.
Never! I don't know what led you here, but nothing will betray my trust. I'll take the secret of the Gourmet's identity to my grave.
No, my lord. It was just circling overhead when I left. I never ran so fast in my life... I thought it would come after me for sure.
Nonsense, you're a vital part of my research team. You'll be there, have no fear! Now, I don't want to hear another word of protest.
Now the Elves dictate everything we do, and they don't want us acknowledging a [QUOTE]mere human[QUOTE] like Talos as the god he is.
Now... I'd like to spend some time communing with Ysgramor. My soul is clean now. Perhaps he'll still welcome me when my time comes.
Oh by Azura, I've made a terrible mistake. I bought a gold ring, and Viola Giordano has been missing a ring that looks just like it.
Oho! The Listener wants my counsel! I thought you were above the opinions of mere mortals, now that you commune with dead old women.
One small detail though - I need all of the gold they gave you. No one skims around here. Come back when you've got every last coin.
Please hurry. To be honest, I'm kind of lonely here. As much as I hated getting sent to Honorhall, I really miss my friends there...
Seek out those closest to you. The final pluck of their misguided heartstrings will accompany my blade in the song of your grandeur.
Someday there'll be proof they caused the Great Collapse. Most of a city just dropping off into the sea... That doesn't just happen.
Sure. How do you think I get my hands on the good stuff and offer it so cheap? You think old Maven is just giving it away to anyone?
Take this with you. I'm not certain if it will help within the walls of the Sepulcher, but I certainly don't need it as much as you.
Thank you. Please, take this. It can't quite compare to an Elder Scroll, but still. You will be remembered for generations for this.
That explains what I saw earlier... flying down the valley from the south... I was hoping I was wrong about what I thought it was...
That is [QUOTE]Feim.[QUOTE] Let that meaning fill you. Su'um ahrk morah. You will find that your spirit will give you more strength.
That will be all for now. I must say I continue to be disappointed in your lack of cooperation. I hope next time you will do better.
That would be Jarl Skald the Elder. He's over in the White Hall, probably talking about Ulfric like he's the second coming of Talos.
The College would agree with you, but do you have any idea how many innocent lives were cut short, just so Azura could have revenge?
The Kelle... Elder Scrolls, as you name them, they have often been used for prophecy. Yes, your prophecy comes from an Elder Scroll.
The Legion's always been here. Without us to keep order, the provinces would fall into barbarism and lawlessness. Especially Skyrim.
The Night Mother may have spoken to you, but I am still the leader of this Family. I will not have my authority so easily dismissed.
The Night Mother's crypt in Bravil was... desecrated. The Imperial Province is ravaged by strife. Nowhere there is safe, at present.
The road to Whiterun's not safe these days. Lots of travelers just... disappear, south of Dragon Bridge. Can't find a trace of them.
The Staff is said to be able to absorb great amounts of energy. Perhaps it can interact with the Eye in a way that nothing else can.
The terms are quite simple, Brynjolf. Nocturnal will allow you to become a Nightingale and use your abilities for whatever you wish.
The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want.
Then it's all true... everything I heard in the stories. The Nightingales, their allegiance to Nocturnal and the Twilight Sepulcher.
There's a tranquility in magic, don't you think? It is simply energy, to be harnessed by those with the will and knowledge to do so.
There's more. Something's happened to Winterhold. It must be whatever Ancano did. You need to get out there and make sure it's safe.
They are called the Forgemaster's Fingers. Bring them to our chief, and he will decide if you're worthy to be Blood-Kin to the Orcs.
Things are tough for him now, I'd wager. What with the fighting, and the dragons. But Balgruuf's a tough old Nord. He can handle it.
This! This... Orb. The Eye of Magnus, whatever you want to call it. It's clearly powerful, and no doubt they want it for themselves!
Thongvor, do you really think that's wise? I mean, King Ulfric is such a busy man, and there are so many areas of Skyrim to protect.
Tired of bread and stew? Had enough of fish and fowl? Treat yourself and your kin to a choice cut of steak or a tender rack of ribs!
To call it a guild is ridiculous. How can people who would betray one another over a gold coin be considered part of an association?
Uncivilized, pelt-wearing axe-draggers. It's a wonder they don't still live in a cave like those ancestors they keep boasting about.
We are traveling to the Shrine of Kynareth in Whiterun. I hear the Gildergreen is more beautiful than ever since it's been restored.
We just want that old native to hand over his land in payment for our services. Then we'll leave, and everyone can get back to work.
We should risk letting those milkdrinkers put Thorryg's woman on the throne? She'll hand Skyrim over to the elves on a silver plate.
We try to uphold the legacy of Ysgramor. To bear his good name such that it never be forgotten, and always be spoken with reverence.
We've been trying to get this item for a while, but no one with the skills has come along to claim it. Can I count on you to get it?
Well done. You have proven the strength of your will and your tongue's gift for lies. You have shown ferocity and prowess in combat.
When we've reclaimed our homeland from the Imperials, we'll take the fight to the Thalmor. They are the true enemy. Make no mistake.
Why that's not the same thing at all. The Dominion were invaders. Conquerors. We had to fight them, to preserve our own way of life.
Wujeeta, you really need to stop using that skooma. It's very bad for your health and I wouldn't want to see anything happen to you.
Yes, father, I did. And I watered her, and got fresh feed, and refitted the old saddle, just like you asked. Is there anything else?
You can't keep quittin' jobs when it strikes your fancy. You're going to make us all look like a bunch of amateurs. Think next time.
You idiot. Do you even know who I am? The most recognized scholar on the Dwemer in all of Tamriel, and you people keep bothering me!
You mean Sibbi? You must be joking! All he wants to do is bed you and be done with it. You may as well get it over with and let him.
You see both of these items are kept inside Dragonsreach, and they don't allow visitors inside the Jarl's or the Steward's chambers.
You should take it to Whiterun. Danica will want to see that the true blessings of nature lie in renewal, not a slavish maintenance.
You think all the council my father provides the Jarl is his alone? Hmph. Let's just say I advise the advisor, and leave it at that.
You, and those aiding you, wish to know more about the Eye of Magnus. You wish to avoid the disaster of which you are not yet aware.
You're a High Elf! I... I never would have guessed it. So many of your recipes are clearly aimed at the commonfolk. It just seems...
Your son chose his side, and he chose poorly. And now he's gone. Such is the way of war. The sooner you accept his loss, the better.
...kill him, he talks to me like that again... ...get him while he's sleeping... ...or poison his meat... ...see how he likes that...
Ah, but no matter. Heartless mortal that you are, you've actually succeeded and survived. I am forced to honor my end of the bargain.
Ah, that reminds me. Speaking of alchemists, I have some frost salts for Arcadia. She asked me to obtain them for one of her potions.
Ah, well, I recently approached Sibbi Black-Briar about buying Frost, one of the finest breeding horses in Skyrim. He agreed to sell.
And between you and me? He wasn't even that good a king. All of those rambling speeches about the Empire this, and the Empire that...
And finally, there's Colette. She may be... difficult to get along with, she's very knowledgeable when it comes to Restoration magic.
And I have. Humiliating at first, but I knew he would let his guard down eventually. That he would come to trust I was under control.
Are you serious? The war is tearing the land apart, the dragons have returned seeking who knows what... Skyrim is going nowhere fast.
Aretino? Why that little bastard! You tell him I'm coming for him! And when I find him, it will be the beating of his miserable life!
At first I don't know why he picked me. I never even held a hammer in my life! But the first time I picked it up, it just felt right!
Aye, love. Love! Even as man, great Talos cherished us. For he saw in us, in each of us, the future of Skyrim! The future of Tamriel!
Between the farm chores, cultivating my supply of nirnroot and keeping a tight rein on my sister Aduri, there's little time for rest.
But every family in the Reach has a story like mine. There are no innocent onlookers in this struggle. Just the guilty, and the dead.
But you know what? I've changed my mind. How about this? I kill you, and butcher each and every one of your miserable little friends?
Calipers? That's utterly ridiculous. Maybe long ago, you could just find calipers in every household across Tamriel, but not anymore.
Deeja and I are more like their representatives here in Solitude. None of the Blackbloods can show themselves without being arrested.
Do not fight it. Azura's prophecies always come to pass. To deny them is to go headlong into the darkness with no light to guide you.
Don't you [QUOTE]dear[QUOTE] me! I had a bowl of Vampire Dust on my worktable not an hour ago and after you swept in there it's gone!
Fair enough. I was hoping you could put aside your loyalties for the greater good, but I see you're firmly in Ulfric's camp. Still...
Fancy yourself the adventuring type, eh? It's just as well, I doubt your combat prowess would prove valuable in a real battle anyway.
First, if we can assassinate their commander, we'll be able to strike them while they're busy tucking their tails between their legs.
General, you've proven yourself a good friend to Skyrim. I continue to trust that you will do your utmost to safeguard our interests.
Going after Cicero now would be a fool's errand. That little jester is currently being digested in Arnbjorn's stomach, mark my words.
He ranted at me, how I didn't know what he's been through, how Isabelle broke his heart when she ran off with some thief named Vex...
He says that he needs me to stay here and work the farm, and even if he did let me be an adventurer, we couldn't afford to buy armor.
He's sending you after King Olaf's Verse then? That's good, we shouldn't leave it lying around now that I've figured out where it is.
Hello there, friend. Have you come to enjoy the sights and sounds of this beautiful sanctuary, as I have? Truly remarkable, isn't it?
Hmph. I like to say I was born with a wand in my hand. Well, not literally - you can see how painful that would have been for mother.
Honestly? I have no idea. But I've looked all over and the kidnappings here started around when she disappeared. So I have to hope...
I admit, I really didn't expect you'd be able to arrange a truce. Getting Ulfric to agree to anything at all is quite an achievement.
I also oversee the activities of the Thalmor Justiciars throughout Skyrim, although this has been unfortunately disrupted by the war.
I ask that you all respect the spirit of High Hrothgar, and do your best to begin the process of achieving a lasting peace in Skyrim.
I can grant you a powerful token for this task. An escutcheon of Dwemer make, capable of shielding you from both the spell and sword.
I don't know if you're capable, and I don't have time to find out. If Kodlak will vouch for you, I might have some work you could do.
I don't know. Beem-Ja has looked after me since I was knee-high to him. I need to rest, and then I think I'm going back to High Rock.
I generally don't involve myself in politics. Good tales deal with the issues of the day, but a wise bard remains a neutral observer.
I most certainly am not. I've just lost my daughter to a Nord beast, and my nephew Titus is too busy playing Emperor to even show up.
I told her. I told her the imperial army would kill her. That this was a war of Jarls and Imperial Generals and we had no part in it.
I used to live at the orphanage here in Riften. Grelod said my ma and da left me there when I was a baby... that they didn't want me.
I was sent here to lead the Thalmor's interests in this corner of Skyrim. It's my mission to root out all Talos worship in this city.
I... I'm sorry! I didn't realize! We... we had no idea who to expect, you understand. You're not dressed as I would have suspected...
I... Well, I just can't believe the Gourmet is a Dark Elf. How difficult it must have been for you in Morrowind. The food there is...
I'd... appreciate if you kept my opinion between us. The last thing I want to do is have my parents [QUOTE]lose[QUOTE] another child.
I'll have a magical tether to your soul while you're inside. Once you're done, it'll be as simple as pulling you back into your body.
I'll lead you across the bridge. Once you're inside you'll want to speak with Mirabelle Ervine, our Master Wizard. Please, follow me.
I'm calling it [QUOTE]Calcelmo's Guide to the Falmer Tongue.[QUOTE] It will revolutionize the way we understand those ancient beings.
I'm just no good at this. You said it yourself. Gods, I don't even like horses. And if it's true what they're saying about dragons...
I'm sorry, just... Just don't hurt me. I know you're not one of them, but you just can't help them. You can't let them know I'm here.
I'm sorry, milady. The components for those elixirs are quite volatile and in some cases, very dangerous to handle. I must take care.
If you can learn to keep your composure and trust that each shot is true, then you should be able to quickly handle multiple targets.
If you had told me a few months ago that some outsider I had never heard of would lead the Companions, I might have slit your throat.
Ilas-tei was practicing Illusions spells. She was having trouble with the calm spells, I believe, but only ever worked with skeevers.
In the very oldest tales, back from when there still were dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal their power.
It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never think to look.
It's my mill. Some folks think it's my town too, but it ain't. The Jarl in Whiterun owns the land and the town. I just pay the taxes.
It's said that Hircine will commune with whoever slays it. I tracked it into these woods, but then had my... accident with the child.
Its sweetness is like a fair maiden's kiss on a starry night. And it's got enough kick to put a frost troll on his hind quarters! Ha!
Karliah was a master marksman and her greatest weapon was the element of surprise. I was lucky... she missed my heart by mere inches.
Kill me if you must. But I can't promise I won't haunt you till the end of your days if... if the Dread Lord lets me. Ha ha ha ha ha.
Like anyone, a crisis will push them towards devotion. I've been seeing a lot of the Shatter-Shields, since they lost their daughter.
Listener! Is that you? Oh, I knew you'd come. Send the best to defeat the best. Astrid knew her stupid wolf couldn't slay sly Cicero.
Look, I was saving this, but I wanted you to have it. I thought I might need it if Sapphire came for me, but I don't need it anymore.
Look, there's a war going on, if you hadn't heard. We barely have enough soldiers to walk the streets, much less patrol every corner.
Mara has reflected an image to me. At the foot of the throat and young woman... almost a girl... her fickle love must resolve itself.
Master Cruel-Sea comes and works the fields sometimes. I don't think the Mistress likes it, but she won't come out here to catch him.
Maybe so, but healthy paranoia has saved this Sanctuary before, and my gut's telling me that demented little fool is up to something.
Much like Mjoll, you've become champion of our hold; helping people with their difficulties and providing assistance for their needs.
My dear, you have no idea who you're trifling with. Now I suggest you turn around and rattle someone else's cage before you get hurt.
My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps as a hunter, but I set my aspirations a bit higher. He never complained... I miss him.
My only concern is your safety, mother. One can only imagine the sordid types he may be conspiring with to bring about your downfall.
Never. Not until we turn this mine around, drive Beitild out of business, and force her to apologize to me for everything she's done!
No, I'm a Redguard. My family hails from the Imperial Province. Ah, but I left home when I was just a lad. Been wandering ever since.
Now, now, my friend. You must look on the bright side. If soldiers storm the city, there's a good chance your husband may get killed.
Now? I announce to all of Markarth that I have returned. Don't worry about your name. They'll know who to blame and fear after today.
Once you know an enchantment, you'll need a filled soul gem, and something to enchant. You'll use the Arcane Enchanter for that, too.
Only bit I could make out was [QUOTE]repaying Ysolda in Whiterun,[QUOTE] and even that's mostly scribbles. Guess you could try there.
Over time, I managed to gain their confidence. Then one night I grabbed a knife, waited until they fell asleep and cut their throats.
Please, milady, it was only because he threatened me. He said he'd have me thrown in the prisons if I didn't give him what he wanted!
Please! You mustn't think I had anything to do with that! I wanted the Emperor dead! The true Emperor! I still do! It was Maro! He...
Remembers our lessons from the sword masters of Alcaire? Let me show you a few things you may have forgotten before we leave Hroldan.
Said he's a writer. Don't know what kind of job that is, but it must earn him some pretty coin. He's paid up for the next few months.
Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.
Simple. Let the Empire fight its own war, with its own funds, and without hijacking our supplies and soldiers. Let Haafingar rebuild.
So enters Maven Black-Briar, the glint of Imperial coin in her eyes. So tell me, what's the price for a woman's integrity these days?
So I gathered. It seems a certain Orc has disappeared. Which means you not only killed the Gourmet, but disposed of the body as well.
So... I've been thinking... I'm grateful we're friends. I'd like you to have this. It's not much, but I hope it's something you like.
Still, I don't want to cross Letrush. Tell you what. Steal the horse and deliver it, and you can have the second half of the payment.
Sure, it tastes great. Only one problem. You said it can make the darkness as clear as day when you drink it. Guess what? It doesn't.
Surprised? So was I, when a member of your [QUOTE]Family[QUOTE] came to me with the plan. We worked out a deal, you see. An exchange.
Take your pick. Dragons, Stormcloak assassins, ambitious and unscrupulous nobles... Sometimes I think his own children want him dead.
That girl's determination won me over. I suppose it didn't hurt that she said she only wanted to learn from the best smith in Skyrim.
That is correct. You see, Frost belongs to the Black-Briar estate. Technically everything in the estate is owned by my mother, Maven.
That's General Tullius himself. He can't stand Elenwen, but she insists that he attend these parties. Just to piss him off, no doubt.
That's why the inn is called Dead Man's Drink, the farm is called Corpselight Farm, and so on. I suppose it's sort of a running joke.
The Emperor would turn Skyrim into a puppet of the Dominion. I for one would not care to dance for the amusement of those foul elves.
The Greybeards are an amazing lot. Imagine, living your entire life without speaking to a friend or a loved one. I couldn't stand it.
The history of Whiterun begins with Jorrvaskr, the hall of the Companions. For a long time, it was the only building on the mountain.
The Necromancer Malkoran defiles my shrine with vile corruptions, trapping lost souls left in the wake of this war to do his bidding.
The only thing I heard is a rumor that a boy named Aventus Aretino, in Windhelm, has been attempting to contact the Dark Brotherhood.
The Thalmor. They stirred up trouble here. Forced us to divert needed resources and throw away good soldiers quelling this rebellion.
The Verse was Svaknir's contribution to the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Each bard adds to the Edda in his or her time.
They can defile our shrine, they can arrest our people and they can silence our voices, but the Empire will never destroy our spirit.
They wanted me to prove my worth, so they threw me up against a young whelp of a lad, hardly old enough to grow his first chin-hairs.
They wouldn't dare give Ulfric a fair trial. Treason, for fighting for your own people! All of Skyrim would have seen the truth then.
They're shrewd traders and don't mind getting their hands dirty. I've bartered with their leader, Ri'saad, on more than one occasion.
Tolfdir is likely already addressing the new Apprentices. Go on in, and if you have any problems, let one of our senior members know.
Too bad I haven't had the same success helping this city shed its poverty. Nivenor thinks I'm wasting my time trying, but I disagree.
Torsten might think Linwe or myself are responsible for Fjotli's death, but I can assure you nothing could be further from the truth.
We are here to guide you in that pursuit, just as the Greybeards have sought to guide those of the Dragon Blood that came before you.
We have had a vision of the next Sybil, living in a village to the north. She must be brought to the temple for her reverie to begin.
We Nords are strong, and we're as tough as stone. But I'll bet you didn't know there's some of us with a good head for business, too.
We stand out here in the cold, as brothers, warmed by the knowledge that we fight for the rights of every free citizen of the Empire.
We're not looking for sellswords. The Stormcloaks need dedicated men and women who're devoted to the cause and willing to die for it.
We've discovered that some of the dead have been... eaten. Flesh has been chewed off, bones were snapped to get at the marrow inside.
Welcome back, soldier. I'm glad you made it in one piece. I'll send men to garrison the fort right away. You did well. I'm impressed.
Well now, you are a strange one. You remind me a bit of myself, when I'm stalking a deer. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that...
Well, he said that a few men have been going by to some of the local farms promising a good price from all the local mills and farms.
Well, like I told Delvin, I think we can help each other. You recover what I'm looking for and take out a rival Guild in the process.
Well, well. Aren't we the overachiever. Three possibilities, three victims. Must have been one of them, right? So why take chances...
When I was a boy, there was a year we couldn't afford enough feed. So I snuck my dinner out to the stables, and gave it to the horse.
Where were you last night, Thonar? Busy with work or have you found some other woman who's willing to tolerate your lack of ambition?
While you're out hunting, keep a sharp eye open for any dragon scales and bones you might find. I'd be interested in looking at them.
Whoever this is, clearly we got off on the wrong foot. Ah, but no worries. This is not the first time I have been bagged and dragged.
With Mercer Frey gone and our influence spreading across Skyrim, the Guild's earned a new level of respect it hasn't seen in decades.
With Vici's murder, you've started us down a path the Dark Brotherhood hasn't traveled in centuries. The assassination of an Emperor.
Yes. There were others at first, but Azura's visions tested everyone's faith. One by one, they left. Afraid to know their own future.
You come here where you're not wanted, you eat our food, you pollute our city with your stink and you refuse to help the Stormcloaks.
You let giants... Giants!... overrun my shrine. Bring me their leader's club as an offering, and I might release you from this curse!
You look like you've just seen a ghost. Please tell me you haven't. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother... but she spoke to you?
You never talk much about yourself, do you Horik? I swear, these past 30 years you've been at my side, and I think I barely know you.
You think anyone around here is going to lift a shovel to help me? Guess again. [QUOTE]Leave the dirty work to old Alessandra.[QUOTE]
You, however, should press on. See if you can find whatever this vision of yours mentioned. But if it is truly dangerous, be careful.
You're not thinking of causing trouble here in this beautiful city, now are you? 'Cause I'd strongly advise against such foolishness.
You're one of us now, you see? A slave. The boot of the Nord stepping on your throat. Maybe if you understood that, I could help you.
Your kind deed will not go unrewarded, my friend. Tell Erik I've changed my mind, and we'll visit Whiterun soon to fit him for armor.
...picking pockets, now that's the real art... ...no rough stuff, just take it and go... ...hmph, don't sound like much fun, though...
A man in my position makes lots of enemies. But what is a life-threatening situation if not an opportunity for mutual benefit? Hmmm?  
A prospective student, are you? Well, I'm afraid I'm not much good at teaching. You should try your luck at the College of Winterhold.
A standard spell for one skilled in Destruction magic is the Firebolt. Casting one at the seal on the ground here would be sufficient.
A thousand years from now Skyrim will have changed rulers dozens of times but the return of the dragons, that story is once in an era.
Ah, splendid, splendid. It's for a special brew I'm working on. A love elixir like none other. Maybe I'll test it on Farengar first...
Ah, yes, I can imagine you'd want to settle that score. Last I heard he was at the Solitude Docks, conducting the Emperor's departure.
And before you ask, no - I don't think it was you. Well, maybe I did, but you saving my sorry hide just now sort of erased any doubts.
And perhaps... well, I don't wish to speculate, but... What if we could contact the dwarves? What if they're still out there? Imagine!
As I mentioned, the amulet I gave you is exceptionally valuable, and will certainly cover the costs of all these other unpleasantries.
At the time I couldn't stand to be around anyone. They all felt sorry for me and I didn't want them to. It was my problem, not theirs.
Aventus Aretino? He only lived here for awhile. I think his mother got sick and died or something. Anyway, he's gone now. He ran away.
Back then, nothing would grow here and so the land was worthless. Now, thanks to hard work and the gods' blessings, our farms prosper.
Bah! A child could have accomplished it. Such is the power of the arcane. If you only knew of the spells I didn't use. He he he he he.
Been hearing some strange tales of the Jarl's children. Say the one's turning wicked, and the others have an ill-favored look to them.
Before the meadery was opened almost fifty years ago, this town was nothing... a simple waypoint for those journeying on to Morrowind.
But I think you'll see that the Legion is Skyrim's only hope for real peace right now. I know you'll make the right choice in the end.
But it's none of my concern who the Imperials want to execute. Especially now. What I want to know is what exactly happened at Helgen.
But until we get that confirmed by General Tullius, just stay clear of other Imperial soldiers and avoid any complications, all right?
But we've only just arrived here -- you've no idea what any of us are capable of. Why not give us a chance to show you what we can do?
But what you must understand about Falkreath is that our town is defined, for better or wrose, by the large and ancient cemetery here.
By Ysmir, it's true. A jester - funny suit and all. Just north, by the Loreius Farm. Fool had a coffin in a cart, with a broken wheel.
Do not confuse inaction with indifference. Often the wisest course is to wait and watch events unfold, until the time to act is clear.
Don't you have all the information you need? Please, the Emperor isn't going to kill himself. Hmph. Now wouldn't that be a blessing...
Focusing solely on flame spells will make them more powerful, but you may find yourself at a disadvantage against foes immune to fire.
Got keen eyes? Might see nasty old Hajvarr up on White River Watch. Piece of work. Jarl should just run him out and have done with it.
Gulum-Ei works in the East Empire Company Warehouse. He helps maintain all of the shipments of goods that goes in and out of Solitude.
Have you decided if I can head up to Solitude yet? I hear it's the best place to meet someone who may be willing to teach me to paint.
He promised me, swore on his ancestors, that he'd give up the mead. And what do I find out? He's been stashing drink in a cave nearby.
Help yourself, milord. It's my finest brew yet... I call it Honningbrew Reserve. I think you'll find it quite pleasing to your palate.
Here, I have a delivery I need to make to Calcelmo. Why don't you take it to him? He knows the history of Markarth better than anyone.
Hmm? Oh, well... To be honest, I was just thinking of Nazeem. The gap between us seems to be widening. He is just so... self-absorbed.
I admit, I doubted you, but no more. You've made a dragon submit to your will. A feat to rival the legendary Olaf One-Eye! What glory!
I can help with purchases, but if you came to talk, see my sister. She's the one who gets on with people. It's her one virtue, really.
I don't fight for the glory of the Empire, nor do I glory in the death of my kinsmen. I fight to bring peace and order to my homeland.
I don't understand why General Tullius hasn't been recalled. The man is clearly incompetent. I have half a mind to tell him so myself.
I feel I owe a bit more than some meaningless coin for all your diligence. Here, this key unlocks my supply chest at Elgrim's Elixirs.
I have a purpose for which you might prove useful. But first I must test the deftness of your guile, and the strength of your purpose.
I have no idea! This is amazing. Absolutely amazing. The Arch-Mage needs to be informed immediately. He needs to see this for himself.
I heard one of them was just arrested trying to sneak into the city. If he's locked up in the jail, perhaps you can get it out of him.
I heard you sneaking around downstairs last night. Were you trying to break into my chest again, son? I've told you to leave it alone.
I might just be a servant among lords, but don't think for a moment I don't take my duties as seriously as the jarl himself takes his!
I once performed the entirety of the Poetic Edda from atop Bard's Leap before trying my luck... Well, you can see how that turned out.
I ran to the scene with other Legionaries who where stationed there, but the entire quarter was a smoking ruin by the time we arrived.
I submit that everyone in this College has, at one time or another, relied on one of the Restoration spells that can keep them at bay.
I suppose you're free to frolic with the wenches in the servant's quarters, but anywhere else, you must have an escort. Jarl's orders.
I swore I was going to just give up, for my child's sake, but it's like my father's ghost is haunting me. Asking me [QUOTE]Why?[QUOTE]
I used to have five good men who worked the mill with me. Then this war started and they all ran off. Idiots with mead in their blood.
I was the one who thought of using this... this Oculory. I don't know what the dwarves called it. Something unpronounceable, I'm sure.
I'll count to three and then say [QUOTE]go.[QUOTE] You have eight seconds to hit each of the three targets. Draw string and get ready.
I'm afraid the necklaces aren't selling well. Customers are not interested in medallions engraved with the symbols of other provinces.
I'm going up there to stop her. This cycle must end. I don't know what brought you here, but I could use your help, if you're willing.
I'm not certain how many scholars you're accustomed to dealing with, but I can assure you that personal wealth is our lowest priority.
I'm not familiar with the tower's history, but it was deserted for quite a long time before Nightcaller Temple was established inside.
I've been away from Solitude for as long as I can. But if you decide to finish these bandits off, you'll be rewarded for your efforts.
I've been hearing stories about dragons. That they're back. That they can eat the sun out of the sky and freeze a man where he stands.
I've never been more sure about anything in my entire life. Someone like Grelod doesn't deserve to live one more day. She's a monster.
If he's worried about some mead-swilling afterlife in Sovngarde, he's free to pursue it. I'll take the glories of the hunt right here.
If the guard accepts, you can serve your time in a cell, or pay your bounty. We've all gone through it. We do what we must to survive.
If you ever manage to gain entry to the College, and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen goods becoming a burden, come visit me.
If you find a book called [QUOTE]The Last Scabbard of Akrash,[QUOTE] could you bring it to me? Tacitus sure isn't learning by example.
If you found any of the sap, I'd be willing to pay you the same cut I offered him. Better price than you are likely to find otherwise.
If you've got some business with Hrongar, mind you stay on his good side. The palace dungeon's filled with folk who roused his temper.
Indeed, it has been jokingly suggested that we send the exact same response to both, which each will warp into support for their side.
Ironically, if she were alive today, she'd be the only living member of the Septim bloodline. By all rights, she would now be Empress.
It's considered a great honor for the family. Their daughter will never know hardship, and the goddess blesses them with great bounty.
It's very nice to meet you. You'll have to excuse Orthus here. He so rarely gets back to civilization. Stuck in Windhelm, poor fellow.
Keening, one of the great tools of Kagrenac himself, is finally in my possession. I don't think I really believed this day would come.
Kodlak is right, though. We've given a piece of our souls for this power. I know my mythic histories. Bargains like that lead to ruin.
Kynareth has placed the Voice of wisdom within you, Dragonborn. All you need do is learn to listen to it, and your path will be clear.
Let's see... found the Dragon Cult... laid siege... people already dead... poisoned themselves... blah, blah, blah...  ah! Here it is!
Listen, lad. I have faith in you. I know that sounds strange coming from a thief, but these recent events have changed my perspective.
Make your way up there and look for Olfrid. He says he's got a matter that requires a delicate touch, and I suggested you for the job.
Maven Black-Briar's gone out of her way to try and have me shut down, but fortunately I have a good relationship with Whiterun's Jarl.
Maybe some other time I'll reveal your destiny, hmm? Tea leaves, palm reading, crystal scrying... Oooh! Maybe trepanning? Ha ha ha ha.
Mercer was able to unlock the Guild's vault without two keys because of what he stole from the Twilight Sepulcher... the Skeleton Key.
Mister Cicero, I for one am delighted you and the Night Mother have arrived. Your presence here signals a welcome return to tradition.
Morthal, capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Not quite in the same league as Solitude or Whiterun, but a nice enough place if you like swamps.
My presence here will be seen as an affront to some within the Order, and as soon as we have finished, I will be leaving your College.
My spies report the Jarl's Steward, Anuriel, has arrangements with the Thieves Guild that would be rather embarrassing if made public.
My story, huh? Everyone in Cidhna Mine has a tale. Let's hear yours first. When was the first time you felt chains around your wrists?
Never forget, the most important job of any bard is to entertain. The day you lose your audience is the day you cut your lute strings.
No one is sure of the cause. Some believed the eruption of Red Mountain had far-reaching consequences that were only felt years later.
Nonsense. If Balgruuf falls, someone will take his place, for better or worse. In the meantime, we have a war to win. And win we must.
Now that the Empire has been driven from the Reach we can put a stop to the raping of her silver mines. That silver belongs in Skyrim.
Now that the Imperial blight has poisoned Riften, the worship of Talos is strictly forbidden by the terms of the White-Gold Concordat.
Oh? True, I may meet my end in a dark alley with a dagger in my back. But the people have seen the truth, and they will not back down.
Perhaps... I'm entrusting you with what resources I can spare. But I'm warning you, if this turns out to be a waste of time and men...
Really, Arniel? Because I seem to recall doing just that for you recently, at which point you assured me that you'd cover my expenses.
Regaining Pale Pass would help our supply situation considerably... and Whiterun is dangerously exposed with the enemy in Falkreath...
Religion isn't going to save me. So unless Mara is going to start raining coin from the heavens, why don't you mind your own business.
Simple right? Almost. The catch is it doesn't count if anyone sees you take it. The message needs to be clear; we work in the shadows.
Soldiers win wars, but where to put them is the key. We have word of an enemy courier in the area. We aim to confiscate his documents.
Started out with a single fishing pole and now I have an entire building and two boats to my name. Not bad for a middle-aged Nord, eh?
Suppose it's the same answer, either way. Winterhold's fallen on hard times, to say the least. Most folk packed up and left years ago.
Talk to Talen-Jei at the Bee and Barb and see if you can get something out of him. They're... well acquainted if you catch my meaning.
Terrible, just terrible. I vastly underestimated the heat transfer necessary, and have destroyed my only working model. I'm at a loss.
That fool son of mine, Erik, wants to be an adventurer. He a good-natured lad, but he's got no idea how dangerous the world really is.
That may well be our only answer. I will empower my Steward to seek out capable individuals to secure Haafingar. Thank you, my Thanes.
The College of Winterhold has thus far declined requests for direct meetings. This has been at the specific request of Arch-Mage Aren.
The cow, of course. Others do it differently, but I've found that an annual offering usually keeps the giants away from our livestock.
The crescent moon represents the Agent of Shadow, the half moon for the Agent of Subterfuge and the full moon for the Agent of Strife.
The details are lost, but at some point the Nords rebelled. After a long and terrible war, the Nords overthrew their dragon overlords.
The few works of his that have been recovered suggest that he had an understanding of magic and the world that few have ever achieved.
The Nords didn't like the peace treaty much either. Thirty years later, the Empire ends up with the Stormcloak rebellion on its hands.
The Thalmor ambassador delivered his ultimatum to the Emperor Titus Mede: the heads of every Blades agent within the Aldmeri Dominion.
The Thalmor would need to make an example of me... I'd be thrown into prison, but our family's honor would be stained for generations.
The Vigil of Stendarr cleanses all Daedric filth from Tamriel. Give us any artifacts you have, or we'll purge you like all the others.
There have been unconfirmed reports that someone has been sneaking into the town of Winterhold while invisible, and causing... issues.
There once was a stranger, with eyes full of danger, he spoke not a word, but his meaning was heard... Sing on, sweet Lurbuk, sing on!
They were crushed, of course, but the survivors - the Forsworn - still lurk in the wilds and make the Reach dangerous for honest folk.
They're as useless as a fifth wheel on a wagon. Gave me some sort of a line about [QUOTE]keeping an eye out for enemy soldiers.[QUOTE]
This is a simple errand, but the time is right for it to be your Trial. Carry yourself with honor, and you'll become a true Companion.
Thonar Silver-Blood stopped it. He wanted the Forsworn at his call, that I would point their rage at his enemies and spare his allies.
Those dreams are not just visions, they're a footprint left by the Daedric Lord Vaermina as she drains these people of their memories!
To begin with, killing any Legionnaire you find out in the wilderness. I've reports they've hidden military camps out there out there.
Ulfric will want to take Whiterun from us. But we will hold fast. We can't give the rebellion free reign through the center of Skyrim.
We stopped in Helgen this morning, and I thought it was all over. Had us lined up to the headsman's block and ready to start chopping.
We were two of the city's oldest an' most-respected clans, an' we could trace our histories all the way back to Ysgramor's companions.
Well, first an' foremost there's repairs to make an' wounds to heal. Folks are depending on us getting the city back in working order.
Well, I'd be careful if I were you. I hear the Nords hunt them for some kind of initiation rite and not all of them end up victorious.
Well, you are lovely to look at, and there's so many things I could teach you, but I'm afraid the Temple isn't taking in new students.
What an honor, the assassination of an Emperor. And all because you are the Listener, favored by the Night Mother, anointed by Sithis.
Whatever. The person you probably want is Nelacar. He's in the Frozen Hearth. Be careful, he was exiled from the College for a reason.
With Ulfric's troops here, Elisif will be forced to support his bid for High King. He secures the position and appears above reproach.
Without two keys, it's impossible to open. I have a key, Delvin has a key, and Mercer has a key. That's it. There are no other copies.
Yes and no. Viik nuz ni kron. Alduin was not truly defeated, either. If he was, you would not be here today, seeking to... defeat him.
Yes, the incense. Fetch for me a deathbell flower, one silver ingot, a flawless ruby, and some vampire dust. Then I will show you how.
Yes. Just because you're now a professional assassin, don't think you have to skulk around in the dark like a skeever and stab people.
You disrespected the Brotherhood. And it'll cost you. You want back into the Family, you pay the price. 500 gold, and all is forgiven.
You have won a mighty victory. Sahrot krongrah - one that will echo through all the ages of this world for those who have eyes to see.
You may be Listener, and head of the Sanctuary, but your recent behavior sets a bad example. I must insist you pay a fine of 300 gold.
You mean the Dragon Bridge issue? I'll be honest with you, I was planning to let that go. Varnius is a bit jumpy at the best of times.
You of course know that the Night Mother is our Unholy Matron. The undying spirit of a great woman who birthed the children of Sithis.
You want to know a secret of mine, young girl? The most effective poison to kill a man? A potion to make others fall in love, perhaps?
You'll be doing whatever Galmar tells you to do, and causing as much mayhem as possible for the Empire and any Jarl who supports them.
Ah, but that was a lifetime ago. Today, I am the last of my kind. My order is extinct. Now, I happily serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary.
And what would you have me say? Sorry for following the misguided teachings of a mad Divine? Sorry for stealing memories from children?
Ari gave me this dagger when we first started hunting together. Always said it brought her luck. You should be the one to carry it now.
As housecarl, my job is to deal with all dangers that threaten the Jarl or his people. So you have my attention. Now, explain yourself.
As we commend your souls to Aetherius, blessings of the Eight Divines upon you, for you are the salt and earth of Nirn, our beloved....
At least two of the owners, Ghunzul and Drascua, are dangerous marauders. And the third owner, Jorgen, I only know he lives in Morthal.
Blocking Pale Pass would cut one of the main Imperial supply routes... and Whiterun is dangerously exposed with the enemy in Falkreath.
Boethiah talks about leaving your mark, a sign of your passing.... Well, you can make a mark on the world without treachery and murder.
Burnin' that banner was a nice touch, too. Should send a clear message to the Summerset Shadows that we're a force to be reckoned with.
But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate it. So long since it's tasted blood. Until you came.
But no, you're content to snatch scraps falling off the Emperor's table. Fine. Take my home. Take my city. May it burn down around you.
But the Night Mother is mother to all! It is her voice we follow! Her will! Would you dare risk disobedience? And surely... punishment?
Didn't take long for Enthir to find a book in the college's library that told of Irkngthand and a great statue with gemmed eyes within.
Don't mock it, pup. Even the lowliest beasts can kill the weak and arrogant. We'll try more powerful enemies next, if you survive this.
Dorthe... I was thinkin' I'd knit a couple of blankets, sell them to Lucan. Would you like to make one? Might be fun, workin' together.
Exactly. When you have a big heavy weight swinging around your upper body, your lower body has to compensate or you'll fall right over.
Forgive me, Ambassador. I allowed this... fool to provoke me. The fault is mine. There is no need for further disruption on my account.
Glad to hear Gulum-Ei got what he deserved. That lizard owes me big for a bad shipment of Shadowbanish Wine he tried to pass off on me.
Ha! Well it's safely hidden away, in a hollowed-out tree stump. Just outside Riften, tucked away nice and secure. You'll never find it.
He fancied himself a thief in some sort of a new Guild forming around here. Gave me some valuable information before... well, you know.
Humph. Who's running the Silver-Bloods? You or your brother? You need to tell Thongvor that he should settle this himself or step down.
I know this place will eventually kill us. I have come to accept that. But I will always regret that day I introduced you to Orchendor.
I know where this is going, son. As I've said many a time. the world is a dangerous place. You're much safer here at the farm, with me.
I own Iron-Breaker Mine. We make twice as much coin as those horkers over in Quicksilver Mine, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
I suspect it may be due to the nature of the soul gem versus the crystals this was intended for. Destroys the equipment in the process.
I think we shall have a grand parade, and let General Tullius march his troops from the Blue Palace to Castle Dour in all their finery.
I used to play in the Yorgrim River when I was just a boy. It's true! I was never afraid of the stories about Forsaken Cave, of course.
I used to visit him from time to time. Nearly crazed by loneliness and captivity. Tiiraz sivaas. He did not even remember his own name.
I was lucky the Companions found me. Now there's a reason to be fighting. The honor of my brothers and sisters is worth more than coin.
I was one of the few who escaped. For a long time, all I cared about was staying alive, and taking revenge on the Thalmor when I could.
I was scared so I told my brother Wulfur. He went to talk to Sibbi for me and... and... Sibbi killed him. My brother wasn't even armed!
I'll anoint you with the symbol of the wolf, the crab and the skeever. This will compel the guardian to appear when you reach his lair.
I'm always looking to replenish my supply, so if you ever come across five of them, I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands.
I'm arranging a job for you, but I need some more time. For now, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over.
I'm really getting tired of your excuses. When you borrowed the money, you said you'd pay it back on time and for double the usual fee.
I've done a lot of... questionable things in my life. Serving Vaermina was a horrible mistake, and I hope Mara will forgive me one day.
I've told you a hundred times, I lock that chest for a reason. I don't want you getting a head full of ideas about adventure and glory.
If a pilgrim was able to complete the path, it was said that they would become one with the shadows. What that means is anyone's guess.
If he wasn't a Black-Briar, I'd march right over to the jail and teach Sibbi some manners... but then I suppose I'd end up like Wulfur.
If this was my Empire, I'd be able to worship whoever I damned well pleased. You wish to see an Empire without Talos? Without its soul?
If you can get Braith to leave me alone, I'll be your best friend... forever! I'll pay you, too! My whole life's savings - two septims!
If you've never been to Riften, be sure to visit the Black-Briar meadery. A few mugs of that and you'll forget all about the long trip.
In exchange, the people of Cyrodiil sleep peacefully, knowing their northern border is guarded by the fiercest warriors in all Tamriel.
It seems to be spreading from the southeast, starting in the Jeralls near Riften. The one near Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds.
It was Aerin who found me dying outside of a Dwemer ruin. If he hadn't brought me here and nursed me back to health, I would have died.
It was important we reclaimed the Reach. Letting Ulfric control the flow of silver was a mistake. One I'm glad we've finally corrected.
It'll be Skyrim that leads the charge. Mark my words. And that time around, mankind will either succeed once and for all or die trying.
Listen, lass. I have faith in you. I know that sounds strange coming from a thief, but these recent events have changed my perspective.
Look around the room and you'll see what we're up against. Just between you and me, a lot of what Ulfric says about the Empire is true.
Most of what you said was gibberish but you left a note. The only bit I could read was [QUOTE]after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.[QUOTE]
Multitudes of our enemies are buried in an avalanche of pain and retribution delivered by your hands. I shall call you Snow-Hammer now.
Nah, not so much. The odd traveler on the road. But mostly just old Fultheim, come to drink away a lifetime of bad memories, I'd wager.
Never. The College cannot become mired in local politics. What happens inside these walls is our worry. What happens outside is theirs.
Normally I'd agree, but we've already lost so many contacts across Skyrim. If we lose the ones in Riften, we may as well close up shop.
Now don't get cross with me, but the officials are demanding compensation for the mark you killed. Had to do it... had no choice, boss.
Now then. Time to proceed to the next stage of the plan. Go and speak with Gabriella. She's been helping me arrange your next contract.
Now this spell is not for defending yourself, but it's just right for heating the Convector. At least three seconds' burn is necessary.
Oh yes! He agreed to banish the worship of Talos at the tip of an Aldmeri sword. They called it the [QUOTE]White-Gold Concordat.[QUOTE]
Oh, and they hate it, too. All their big talk of pride and honor, and what have they got to show for it? Beggar's rags and stale bread.
Oh, it's Nazeem. He's been spending more and more time fawning over the Jarl. I swear, we're hardly ever home at the same time anymore.
Once we have the Lexicon, we'll need to take it to its podium. I know what to do from there. Soon the Lexicon's knowledge will be mine.
Purposely killing your fellow College members is a bad idea. I'd advise against it. Theft and assault can get you into trouble as well.
Right, then. You prefer to listen, is that it? Well, you must represent the Dark Brotherhood. I certainly wasn't expecting anyone else.
Shh shh. It's fine, child. It's fine. But we must be cautious, hmm? What we do, the things I teach you. The others wouldn't understand.
Slaughtering the Emperor's cousin? At her wedding? Those guards will be out for blood. Wouldn't surprise me if the crowd jumped in too.
Solitude's a big port town, you know? Full of sailors and their tales of far away lands. Most of 'em's foreigners and liars, of course.
Some may find their inspiration tucked away in tomes, or by carousing in the cities, but I find it here in the vast expanses of Skyrim.
Someone with connections to our Guild wants us to hit this place and send a message by clearing it of valuables. You want to handle it?
Something was discovered in Saarthal that was significant enough that Tolfdir sent a new member of the College, alone, to deliver word.
Sometimes we like to remind a city that we mean business, so we hit it hard. Just steal whatever we can until we've made an impression.
Splendid. Then we're ready to begin. Or, more specifically, you're ready to begin. After all, you're the one the Night Mother spoke to.
That is the true meaning of [QUOTE]Yol.[QUOTE] Suleyk. Power. You have it, as do all dov. But power is inert without action and choice.
That is to say, it's been suggested that resources used for my study of Restoration could be put to better use. Any other use, in fact.
That was almost 150 years ago, and the pieces are still being kept by the descendants of that group. And they're right here, in Skyrim.
That's enough recruits for now. Ask Esbern about the dragon lairs he's been studying. We'll have the recruits do some hunting with you.
The Black-Briar family has always been allied with the Guild. Our connections with the Empire and within Skyrim make for a perfect fit.
The Dawnstar Sanctuary? That where you lot are holing up in now? Hmm... Tell you what. It'll cost you - a lot - but I can help you out.
The Emperor himself supposedly backs them, which means they have fairly unlimited resources... so don't get their feathers in a ruffle.
The Empire and the Dominion agreed that the worship of Talos was a relic of the past, and must be eliminated in the interests of peace.
The Empire would have us become slaves to the Thalmor. We are not slaves. We are men. Free men who will slay anyone who begs to differ.
The Great War is long past. It's time the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion put aside their differences. Prosperity is good for everyone.
The Night Mother's crypt, in Bravil, was destroyed. A result of the chaos caused by the war with the Thalmor. That forced a relocation.
The sealed letter you delivered to me was mysteriously unsealed upon its arrival. I can only assume you've read its contents. Sloppy...
The Stormcloaks only rebel because the Empire uses Skyrim as its personal larder. The more they take, the more support the rebels gain!
The Stormcloaks were forced to retake the Reach on our own, but that taste of independence emboldened them. And the Forsworn were born.
Then we will immediately send out a legion to scour the cave and secure the town. Haafingar's people will always be safe under my rule.
There are thieves and then there is Gulum-Ei. No honor, no code at all. He'd shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time.
There's no worse enemy to humankind in Tamriel. The Empire barely survived the last war. The Thalmor don't intend to lose the next one.
They were among the first men to arrive from Atmora and they worshipped certain animals as avatars of the Gods; Dragons being foremost.
Things are quiet for the moment. That won't last long. As soon as a new campaign starts, I want you there. Stay close. See me tomorrow.
This is what I've been trying to explain. It's in Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden deep in the crags of the Reach.
This land is riven by war, and her people suffer for it. The Stormcloaks are a blight on Skyrim, and like any blight... must be purged.
Through sources that shall remain nameless, I've tracked down what I believe to be the final resting place of King Borgas - Korvanjund.
To be honest, I simply can't stand some of my students. Only Aia shows true potential for greatness. The rest are just wasting my time.
Trust in me, Whiterun! Trust in Heimskr! For I am the chosen of Talos! I alone have been anointed by the Ninth to spread his holy word!
Urag has asked me to remind everyone to please return materials borrowed from the Arcanaeum in the same condition as you received them.
We have as much right to be at this council as all of you. More, actually, since we were the ones that put the Dragonborn on this path.
Well done! I'll send men with a wagon to collect our prize. We'll put the weapons to use here, and I'll send the coin back to Windhelm.
Well, first you'll need these. While you're not required to wear them, you may find them more to your liking than your current clothes.
Well, my family back in Hammerfell didn't approve of my interest in lethal poisons and death in general. So I left, and wandered north.
What about you? Have you... have you spoken to anyone? No.... No, of course not. I do the talking, the stalking, the seeing and saying!
What's your sign? I was born under the Steed, as luck would have it. Really ought to visit my doomstone somtime. It's fairly near here.
When Gallus took one look at this statue, he knew it was something special. He took it right up to Enthir at the College of Winterhold.
With Mercer Frey gone and our influence present in all of Skyrim's cities, the Guild's accumulating wealth faster than we can spend it.
With most of the hold's fighting men committed to the war, there are fewer swords to keep the roads safe from brigands and wild beasts.
Yes. According to Giraud, our histories keeper, the portion of the Edda dealing with King Olaf might still exist in Dead Man's Respite.
Yes. This was ages ago, you understand. There were more of us then. Before the bruniikke - the Akaviri - came and killed all my zeymah.
You and the Night Mother are of course welcome here, Cicero. And you will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as Keeper.
You there, please you have to help me! I was attacked by a vampire! Do you have a potion or something that can cure this before I turn?
You're damn right we'll accept it. If we pull this off, the Dark Brotherhood will know a fear and respect we haven't seen in centuries.
You've got a lot of nerve, suggesting something like that, to me of all people! If this was Riften, I'd have you thrown in the dungeon!
Your quick mastery of a new Thu'um is... astonishing. I'd heard the stories of the abilities of Dragonborn, but to see it for myself...
A special type of soul trap. Placing you inside the Star without fully killing you. Once Malyn has been dealt with, I'll bring you back.
After the Oblivion Crisis was over, many felt that magic users were to blame. Elves, to be specific. It created a great deal of tension.
Ah, I forget you're new to Skyrim. Jarl Elisif, I should say, although only because she was married to Jarl Torryg when he was murdered.
And the Night Mother, who, according to everything we know, will only speak to the person chosen as Listener... just spoke. Right now...
Astrid, I've been hearing some, er... interesting things, from the others... about what you did when you left the Sanctuary last week...
Being a humble servant of Mara, I have little in the way of gold or coin, but perhaps I can offer you something better... companionship.
Between you and I, I think his motivations are a bit more self-serving. He uses this holy war as leverage in order to pursue the throne.
By doin' these extra jobs and puttin' some fear into the people, we can take back the cities and start bein' taken seriously once again.
By the way, I don't know who you are, but unless you want me to blow your cover, I'd advise that you avoid me for the rest of the party.
Curse my good-for-nothing daughters! My wife was twice the woman they'll ever grow to be. She gave her life birthing them. What a waste.
Damn it. What were they doing there? Imperial spies are everywhere. Never forget that...  I trust you gave them a thrashing? Now then...
Don't get me wrong, I'll steal any gem that isn't nailed down. But there's something about those blue stones that gets my blood boiling.
Everyone was dead. Wholesale slaughter. The Dominion, not content with killing dissidents at home, came to Hammerfell to finish the job.
Falling in love with Gallus was wrong. It was a distraction that allowed the Sepulcher to be desecrated and it likely cost him his life.
Farm work is hard work. It's good to relax when I can, but I still have to listen to my brothers harping about [QUOTE]injustices.[QUOTE]
First we'll kick the Thalmor and their bloody Imperial puppets out of the country. Then we'll rebuild Skyrim into the land she once was.
Gathering plants, picking mushrooms, brewing potions. It all gets so dreary after a while. This town needs something exciting to happen.
Generally, if you want rumors, you should talk to Corpulus. That said... I did see a visitor pass through on his way to the Blue Palace.
Good. I knew that we could count on you. It's simply a beast, but be cautious. The beasts of Skyrim are made of sterner stuff than most.
Got a personal request from Brynjolf on this numbers job. He says we may hit 'em hard later, and wants to prep their books. Help us out?
He founded the Empire, and now they've turned their back on him. To appease the Elves. Elves! Do the Elves rule Skyrim, or do the Nords?
He founded the Empire, and now they've turned their back on him. To appease your kind, Elf. Do your people rule Skyrim, or do the Nords?
Hello, hello, hello. Interested in fighting in the Pit? The rules are strict, but if I don't see it, it didn't happen, know what I mean?
Hmph. When most would speak, you listen. You think. You understand that the only thing that matters is you following my orders. To kill.
I am, thank you. I do so enjoy singing at weddings. It's just one of the many duties we at the Bards College are called upon to perform.
I do know the Gourmet was classically trained in traditional Breton cuisine in High Rock. So that's where he must have met Anton Virane.
I don't believe it. You found the Forgemaster's Fingers. You've impressed me, outlander. No one else has returned from this task before.
I don't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun. Eorlund Gray-Mane was that and more, but now he's dead. All I ask is a fair chance.
I grew up an orphan on the streets of Markarth. I'd have died there, too, but for the kindness of an old warrior named Logrolf the Bent.
I knew something was up. I'll make sure he doesn't disrespect this place anymore. Honesty is a rare thing to find these days. Thank you.
I know many things. I have studied things beyond the reach of most humans, traveled the Oblivion planes, seen things one should not see.
I learned to cook from my father. Ah, but that was a long time ago. Before, you know... I killed him. But let's not talk about that now.
I mean, yes. Certainly it is, but that doesn't matter now, because I know you're hoarding something even more important at your College.
I prefer finery. Like this. Here, for your trouble. And I suppose I should show you a little about Illusion magic for free, shouldn't I?
I was there only for a short time. Much of what I have learned has been on my own. And I will teach you. You have no reason to go there.
I'll let that comment go because you're new here. Ask things out of turn again, and we have a problem. Now, are we clear on all of this?
I'm kept so busy, I don't get to see my daughter as often as I'd like. Perhaps you've met her? Adrianne? She owns the shop, Warmaiden's.
I'm not so certain that Ulfric's intentions are as noble as they think. I think Ulfric cares about Ulfric and the rest is a smokescreen.
If you don't mind a piece of advice, I'd stay out of trouble in Markarth. They'll toss you in the Cidhna Mine, and you'll never get out.
If you were willing to wear one of Radiant Raiment's outfits and speak to the Jarl I would not only pay you but let you keep the outfit.
It is his shrine people pray to when they visit the Hall. That his divinity will watch over their ancestors on the way to the next life.
It was said to force a dragon to experience the concept of Mortality. A truly vonmindoraan... incomprehensible idea to the immortal dov.
It'll do you good! Maybe you could visit Irgnir or Fruki on your way out? I've seen them looking at you when they come in for drinks....
Kyne! Blessed Warrior-Wife. Shor's widow, sacred to any true Nord hunter. She's the mother of men and beasts, and her veil is the storm.
Listener, please... if Cicero is going to be a part of this Sanctuary I'll accept that. But can't you do something about the... dancing?
Look at these figures, Thongvor! Ore yield is down by half, and the amount of silver bars being smelted is slipping even more than that.
Lost my helmet in one of the old caves. My pretty, pretty helmet. Life just got worse after that. Kept losing things. So many things....
Markarth will be handed over to Ulfric's forces. Jarl Igmund will step down, and Thongvor Silver-Blood will become the Jarl of Markarth.
Maybe you can do something for me, first? Duach has a bottle of Skooma. Finest distilled Moon Sugar. I'm shaking just thinking about it.
Mehrunes Dagon, the Lord of Change, we have brought your Razor to you. We beg you, please bring the blade's full glory to Tamriel again!
Mercer doesn't need to die... he needs to feel the cold sting of fate as his life crumbles in front of him and he's hunted by the Guild.
Most of the Legion is tied down on the border with the Aldmeri Dominion. The Emperor can't afford to risk weakening Cyrodiil's defenses.
My books tell the stories. Have no doubt - as pretty as its streets are, as jovial as the bards may be... darkness is drawn to Solitude.
My daughter Adrianne wants to forge a new sword for you. Now, it wouldn't be a Skyforge blade, I know, but she really is quite gifted...
My daughter is the one who needs your pity. I'm just a poor Forsworn whose only regret is not killing more Nords before I was locked up.
My husband owns it, barely. He'll lose it soon enough. He's behind on his loan payments, but he drinks all his money away just the same.
My lady, there could be agents of the Empire looking for an opportunity like that to have you killed. Are you willing to take that risk?
My understanding is that all they really do is make noise in an attempt to curry favor from the Emperor. Lots of politics, little magic.
My... associate will be pleased at your resourcefulness. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me.
Never underestimate the ability to influence others. Whether they're friends or foes, they're almost all susceptible to Illusion spells.
Oblivion has been watching you since the day you were conceived, mortal. Do not think that your life has been served by your will alone.
Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities to [QUOTE]acquire[QUOTE] things from time to time. Can't afford to get rusty, now can we?
Oh, it's ancient. Apparently one of the first Sanctuaries in Skyrim. It hasn't been used by the Brotherhood in close to a hundred years.
OK, your turn. Try and hit that target way in the back, far behind the other three. Remember to take your time and make your shot count.
One of our marks seems to have an item of value we want to add to our vault. Get it for us and you'll receive the usual pay. Sound good?
Records showed her buying passage aboard a sailing vessel named [QUOTE]The Pride of Tel Vos,[QUOTE] but that's where the trail ran cold.
Remember, your target is Gaius Maro, the son. Not Commander Maro, the father! We need him alive. But the son... Ha! Scorch his face off!
Seems the Emperor's coming to Skyrim... and one of his own protectors was going to have him assassinated. Can't trust anyone these days.
Seven septims are missing from my purse. I know it was Runa. You get those coins back, or by Stendarr, I'll see her rot in the dungeon. 
She served as a Battle Maiden, using her healing arts to help those that fell on the battlefield. Never even lifted a blade in her life.
So little is known about the Elder Scrolls, almost anything is possible where they're concerned. Artifacts of truly inconceivable power.
Thanks for getting me out of that. Bashnag's coven chased me out and left me for dead down here. Nobody lasts too long with the spiders.
The city guard in Solitude is seeking Arn for a serious crime. When he fled here, he was arrested for drunken behavior. Can you imagine?
The existence of so-called [QUOTE]Doomstones[QUOTE] throughout Skyrim has been repeatedly verified. The meaning of these stones has not.
The Forsworn follow the old ways, but some of those were best forgotten. Blood sacrifices, communing with Daedra. It's the road to ruin.
The Legion's work is far from finished, but you are free to roam. I suspect you'll be of greater good to Skyrim out there, in the world.
The only question in my mind is whether you will be granted The Dreamstride. Otherwise, the worst that could happen is a bad aftertaste.
The prominent feature here is the Hall of the Elements. It's our primary location for lectures, practice sessions, and general meetings.
Then what in Sithis' name is going on? Cicero spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Is this just more of the fool's rambling?
Then, finally, realization and horror arrive together. The orange is flame, heat. The sound a roar, a challenge in their ancient tongue.
There is room in my court for a new Thane. It's an honorary title, mainly, but there are a few perks someone like you could make use of.
They're holed up in some old dwarven ruin - Raldbthar. It's near Windhelm. They use it as their base. It's where they stage their raids.
They're... adequate. Honestly, I rely on the business brought in by the Burning of King Olaf, and that's not likely to happen this year.
This again?! That was different. Was Balgruuf given a chance to object? No. The Jarls weren't asked. He was told. And he had to like it.
Trouble on the roads and cities means less commerce. Less commerce means less money and more starving people. And that means more crime.
Very little money passes through Winterhold anymore, but if there's one thing you can count on, it's folks needing a drink now and then.
Was this before or after the Mythic Dawn attacked the Emperor and Valen single-handedly fought them off? Just shut up and drink, Romlyn.
We're mounting our attack on Markarth. Get over there and join the brothers gathering for the attack. This is it now! Talos be with you.
We've also had run-ins with spies attempting to probe our security for weaknesses. I work with the city guard to make certain they fail.
We've done it. The Star has been cut off from Azura, and Malyn's soul finally has some measure of peace, even if it is in non-existence.
Well aren't you in luck. He's the next piece of gutter scum on the docket. Between you and me, I hope you cleave his arrogant head open.
Well, there might be nothing to it, but I've heard that the feud between the Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns in Whiterun has grown ugly.
Well, there's the occasional wolf pack or stray, but that's all I've ever had to deal with. Shouldn't be a problem for the likes of you.
Well, to be frank, we don't. Its location was lost with King Borgas, when the Great Hunt killed him while off on his Alessian campaigns.
Wh... What? A crime? Me? Preposterous! Poor Cicero is just standing here! Cicero loves order. Oh yes! He would never disrespect the law!
When I was a child, my village was burned to the ground by bandits. Do you know I actually saw one laugh as he ran my brother through...
When my strength returned and he told me about the problems plaguing Riften, I decided fate brought me here for a reason... so I stayed.
When the smoke cleared, the White-Gold Concordat was signed... it was supposedly a treaty aimed at establishing peace within the Empire.
When you have done so, I will unbind Hevnoraak. He will awaken in a weakened state, but the lich is still to be reckoned with. Be ready.
Why, just this last week I was commenting to my fellow meadery workers just how lucky we are to be working for such a charitable family.
Yes, an unfortunate turn of events, that. But an isolated incident. And I have been assured that the fault was with the man's son alone.
Yes, I did. I shouldn't be the one to tell you about this. There's an Altmer named Nelacar in the Frozen Hearth. Believe me, he'll know.
You are traitors and will die traitors' deaths. Stand down and face public execution, or advance and face summary execution by my hands.
You could report the fool. You know, say he's done something against the law. That will at least get rid of him for me. What do you say?
You look like you've seen your share of adventure. I envy you that. In fact, maybe you can help me with something. Will you hear me out?
You mean Roggvir. Yes. I made an appeal to Captain Aldis. He allowed Roggvir to have a proper Nord burial, as is the custom in Solitude.
You should talk with Delvin Mallory and Vex. They know their way around this place and they'll be able to kick some extra jobs your way.
You'll find that this place offers many things that will help you in your endeavors as well as a wealth of information for you to learn.
You're right. You're right. Feller might be nutters, might not. But fact is, he needs help. I turn him away, what kind of man am I, hmm?
You've already done us a service in stopping the binding, but I need you to go talk to him, to see if Styrr can tell us what to do next.
You've seen how we live -- cramped alleys, run-down buildings, few guard patrols. Even the name [QUOTE]Gray Quarter[QUOTE] is an insult.
Your world is admirably seeped in lies and inclinations. My blade is a darling leech that feeds on deceptions, and nourishes its master.
Zu'u ni tahrodiis. It was you that lured me here and took me prisoner... vobalaan grahmindol. I have done nothing to earn your distrust.
... no, sorry, but in times like these I can't just take the word of a stranger who wanders into town claiming to be my brother's friend.
[QUOTE]If we can just make it through, it'll all be worth it[QUOTE], I told them. And the fools believed the words I myself didn't trust.
A convenient position to hold now. But mark my words, old man, in the days to come, Ulfric will spread his rebellion thin. And what then?
A few days ago, one of her servants busted through a wall into the Temple of Divines. We'll need you to go into the Catacombs themselves.
Aaah... yes! Sossedov los mul. The dragonblood runs strong in you. It is long since I had the pleasure of speech with one of my own kind.
Ahlam, let's be honest. Your husband is an arrogant, domineering buffoon. These are the words you used to describe him to me... remember?
And Dawnstar is known for its bad luck. We're the last port of call before Windhelm, and the ore we trade makes rich targets for pirates.
As I recall, it's resting in Rimerock Burrow. Barbas can lead you right to it. The little mutt might even earn his place back at my side.
As long as you can keep things quiet and don't get yourself killed in the process, this place has exactly what we're looking for. You in?
Astrid has arranged for your escape, no? Then you have nothing to worry about. Get in, kill the Emperor, and get out. Then, we celebrate.
Balimund pulled me out of Grelod's orphanage when I was just a child. I don't know what he saw in me, but I was glad to get out of there.
Bring them to me - but be careful, mortal. They are guarded by Hevnoraak's minions. They will stop at nothing to see their master return.
But to answer your question, the White-Gold Concordat was the fancy name they put on the peace treaty between the Empire and the Thalmor.
Cyrodiil is a beautiful place, full of diverse peoples and histories. But so too, Hammerfell and Skyrim, and every other place I've been.
Do not let your easy mastery of the Voice tempt you into the arrogance of power that has been the downfall of many Dragonborn before you.
Do not mistake the night-shrouded thief's stealthily-taken spoils, stolen and unearned, for a warrior's plunder, won in honorable battle.
Dragons are part of the natural order of the world. The Blades thought to change the order to suit themselves, by wiping out the dragons.
Face it, cow! Your stupid son is dead! He died a Stormcloak traitor. And you... you best keep your mouth shut before you suffer the same.
Go quiet, break him out, then run. This isn't a suicide mission. Don't risk combat if you can avoid it. If you can't, then give 'em hell.
Goldenglow Estate is a bee farm; they raise the wretched little things for honey. It's owned by some smart-mouth wood elf named Aringoth.
He likes to get drunk and walk around the Gray Quarter yelling insults at us in the small hours of the morning. A real charmer, that one.
He opened a gate and the wrong man rode out of it. If that man hadn't been Ulfric Stormcloak. If Ulfric hadn't killed High King Torygg...
Hey. In the Bannered Mare, there's this bottle of Argonian Ale. The good stuff. Get it for me. They won't even know it's gone. Come on...
Hmmm, Olaf did become king and Numinex escaped later. It's entirely possible... and I'm sure the court will like that, I'm writing it in.
However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold, and who owns at least one piece of property in my city.
Humph. Used to be everyone in Markarth wore a necklace showing his home province, from Elsweyr to High Rock to Hammerfell and Cyrodiil...
I did the Black Sacrament, over and over. With the body, and the... the things. And then you came! An assassin from the Dark Brotherhood!
I had just come into Falkreath. They needed some help working the mill, and I thought that would be something safe. Something I could do.
I love the cold air... it's exhilarating. Perhaps it's because of my Nord blood, but there's something about it that makes me feel alive.
I met her when I wandered into Riften a few years ago. Been smitten with her ever since. In fact, I'm thinking of asking her to marry me.
I met one of the caravan leaders, Ma'dran. He said he'd help get me started if I could bring him a mammoth's tusk. Easier said than done.
I see you have meditated on this subject quite thoroughly. I shall not stop you, but please, try to attend to your temple duties as well.
I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to her! To the Listener!
I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to him! To the Listener!
I thought they were taking us south to Cyrodiil. Parade us in front of the Emperor. But then we stopped in Helgen, and you know the rest.
I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-sister to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain.
I went to Windhelm to see the Shatter-Shields. They were old and dear friends, and... in mourning. Friga was killed recently. Murdered...
I, his only son, forced to deliver his eulogy via a letter I had smuggled out of prison. Such is the love of Titus Mede for his subjects.
I... I'm sorry I... I got too excited. I'm in the middle of some very... stressful work, and I shouldn't have yelled. How can I help you?
I'll make for Riften and scout the situation; see if I can discover what Mercer's up to. When you're ready, meet me at the Ragged Flagon.
I'm glad we've taken back Winterhold. While the Imperials were up there, important resources were tied up stiffening our northern border.
I'm no man's fool. I know Ulfric Stormcloak's selfish and power-hungry, but he's the devil I know. Does that put it plain enough for you?
I've always felt a great deal of guilt running from Nightcaller Temple and leaving my friends to die. I'll never forgive myself for that.
I've thought this through, and it's the only way. She's too far gone, too corrupted by the Hags. At least in death she can be free again.
If the stories about the staff are true, if it really can absorb a tremendous amount of power, maybe we can break through Ancano's magic.
If you ever try and [QUOTE]practice the Dibellan arts[QUOTE] with Hemming again, I'll make sure that pretty little face loses its beauty.
If you really want to... Just be careful of the ghost! He snuck up on me once and scared me sick. It took a week for me to feel better...
If you want to embarrass yourself, I won't stop you. Kodlak is the Harbinger. He's the closest thing you'll find to a leader around here.
It seems that after the strength of the Cult was broken in the Dragon War a last contingent came here to create a stronghold and regroup.
It's a religious matter. The Thalmor do not recognize Talos as a god. He was only a man, and does not deserve to a place in our pantheon.
Just place the soul gem inside, and heat the Convector. At least three seconds. You'll almost certainly need to find multiple Convectors.
Keep your eyes and ears open my Brothers and Sisters.  Orchendor needs us to keep vigilant while he convenes with Peryite in the Arcanex.
Look, that Vici woman had a bodyguard. I know it's terrible she got murdered at her own wedding, but the city guard is hardly to blame...
Look, this mold is irreplaceable. I'll pay you well for its return and I can also prove to be quite a valuable ally to the Thieves Guild.
Next time you speak to him, tell him to clean up his own messes. I'm not about to jeopardize this position for a bunch of low-life thugs.
No doubt. The appearance of a Dragonborn at this time is not an accident. Your destiny is surely bound up with the return of the dragons.
Nonsense. The best place for our men is driving the Imperials back. I will ensure that men from Dawnstar get every opportunity for glory.
Not much, to be honest. Their return was a shock to us all. Giraud Gemane has some tomes about them in the library, if you're interested.
Nothing at all. It's very... nice. If you want something with a little more style, however, you should come by our shop. Radiant Raiment.
Of course nothing in here is stolen. Only a careless, shameful, idiotic fetcher would do something as stupid as to buy pilfered goods....
Oh, I don't know. Yes, we'd make more money, but I don't like the idea of you traveling alone out there with the war and talk of dragons.
Only in that I'm a graduate. I work over at the Winking Skeever. I would highly recommend it though. Talk to Viarmo if you're interested.
Perhaps, but necessary. As you know my cousin, Fura, died out there fighting for us. She wouldn't have had to, if it weren't for Roggvir.
Riften denies the Emperor. You are here illegally. Stand down and you will be arrested and tried in the morning. Resist and you will die.
Rorikstead's a nice enough little hamlet, but a boring posting for a guard. If a dragon attacks, well... then it'll be a different story.
Seeing as how Riften is home to the Thieves Guild, maybe we can work something out if you have trouble with the law. For the right price.
Shadows creep, and... and phantoms leap! A man got... he got scared. And the demons dared! To um... visit upon him all which they feared!
She separated from her husband several months ago. Now the two run competing mining operations. Beitild's angry and desperate. A fighter.
So go. Go to Volunruud. It's a crypt, pretty far to the northeast. Talk to this Amaund Motierre. And let's see where all this leads. Hmm?
So I ask of you a favor. An old man's dying wish. While there are many who would see me dead, there is one who set the machine in motion.
So if there's a murder at the wedding... Not only will it stall the peace process - it will send shockwaves throughout the entire Empire.
Still, I've got this axe, and even if I can't use it, I'm sure someone would make a deal for it. Maybe I'll have a word with Molag Bal...
Studies stars? I remember the last time the word [QUOTE]stars[QUOTE] was flown through the Hall of the Elements. Bad things had happened.
Suit yourself. I hate to turn away any friend of Hadvar, but in times like these... you understand if I can't just take your word for it.
Thanks to Maven Black-Briar, we still have some pull in Riften. But get arrested in Whiterun and you'll be tossed right into the prisons.
That they had arrived, asked for information which was provided to them, and went on their way with no suggestion of further interaction.
That's the spirit. By swearing this oath you become one of us. A hero of the people. A true son of Skyrim. A Stormcloak. Repeat after me.
The Empire will allow Ulfric's forces to enter Falkreath. Jarl Siddgeir will step down, and Dengeir of Stuhn will take his place as Jarl.
The front gate is locked so you'll need to use the mine entrance behind us.  Open the front gate and we'll try and give you some support.
The Guild's at full strength and we have you to thank for it. We've had our share of dark times, and now they seem like a distant memory.
The moisture in the air is better for the ingredients. It isn't every day that you get your hands on fresh nirnroot or painted troll fat.
The only people I offend are cheats who don't pay me enough gold coin, or idiots who don't know good meat when I throw it at their faces.
The parchment you recovered mentions a [QUOTE]Gajul-Lei.[QUOTE] According to my sources, that's an old alias used by one of our contacts.
The rebels called it [QUOTE]The Markarth Incident.[QUOTE] It was the founding day for the Stormcloaks, and where this war really started.
The Thalmor Justiciars are so often misunderstood. Our primary goal is to preserve the peace between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion.
The thief had broken into a nobleman's home somewhere in Windhelm and made off with a small figurine of a snow elf with crystalline eyes.
The Way of the Voice is an ancient, spiritual form of magic in which you project your vital essence into a [QUOTE]thu'um[QUOTE] or Shout.
There you are. Took your sweet time dealing with Cicero, hmph? Now let's get down to business. Astrid told you about the Gourmet, I hope?
There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro and the Stormcloaks in the Emperor's assassination.
There's someone I like very much in Riften. I think I'd like to marry him someday, but... well, he's not of my kind. Would Mara be angry?
They are not yet tired of war. Far from it. Do you know the ancient Nord word for war? [QUOTE]Season unending[QUOTE]... so it has proved.
This will require stealth and discretion. The Jarl's guards won't take kindly to anyone rummaging through her Steward's private quarters.
To earn your bonus, do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting.
Tullius must be getting nervous. Taking Hjaalmarch we're practically in his backyard now. As soon as we're able, we'll march on Solitude.
Typically, love in Skyrim is as earnest as the people who live here. Life is hard, and short, so there is little room for long courtship.
Ulfric fought for that dream with more courage and honor than any Nord who ever lived. But now he's gone, and the dream is gone with him.
We just received word that somebody tried to kill the Emperor! Turned out to just be his double, but can you imagine if he had succeeded?
We tracked a bear to this den. Good coin for those pelts. We had the big sow cornered when they showed up. Three of them, out of nowhere.
We will bring the battle to their chief camp. There will be none left living to tell their stories. Only songs of Jorrvaskr will be sung.
We're making sure your Emperor wasn't lying to his elven masters when he agreed the Empire would give up false gods and foolish beliefs. 
We're particularly interested in the prevalence of magical seals placed on the tombs here. It's rather unlike anything we've encountered.
We've been trying to catch Ulfric since the war started, but he always seemed to slip through our fingers... like he knew we were coming.
Well, I just never expected the Gourmet to be a Breton. It almost seems too obvious. Some of the greatest cooks have been Bretons, and...
Well, I only know what I've heard in the old tales. Shouting is an ancient form of magic - the use of one's voice to project their power.
Well, there's Ingun Black-Briar, Maven's daughter. Strange girl. She likes to spend time down in Elgrim's Elixirs working on her alchemy.
What? Were you hoping to claim this house for yourself? Well, the Aretinos always liked me, so I think I'm family enough to take up here.
When I'm in Whiterun, I always visit the Gildergreen. Never hurts to pay your respects to Lady Kynareth, particularly in my line of work.
Why are you here? Killing Gaius Maro is but the first step of your contract - you must also plant the incriminating letter on his body...
Why don't you just formally join up? Quit sittin' here wheelin' and dealin' when you could be out there makin' a heck of a lot more coin.
With respect, Jarl. You can't ask everyone to throw themselves against trained Legionnaires. Let's leave the fighting to the Stormcloaks.
Without his guidance, our homeland is falling apart. North wages war against south! The holy flame flickers and dies! We need his return.
Without the matching claw, they're normally impossible to open. And since I'm certain Karliah already did away with it, we're on our own.
You kept saying it would be a huge ceremony at Morvunskar. You said you even had some magic staff there that would handle all the guests.
You know, I saw something near Shimmermist Cave, to the northeast. Some kind of creature... small and wicked. Never seen its like before.
You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now, it's as if the very stars have finally aligned.
You take that book to General Tullius or Ulfric and let them have their little triumph. It will be delivered back here to me soon enough.
You're one of us now, you see? A slave. The boot of your kinsmen stepping on your throat. Maybe if you understood that, I could help you.
[QUOTE]Night of Tears[QUOTE], by Dranor Seleth. Old book, one I'd forgotten about. This thing here... it might be what the book was about.
A curious figure. Unrepentantly evil and nasty, of course, but also astonishingly brilliant, and obviously quite a necromancer at her end.
A little history, first. After the Oblivion Crisis, a number of groups cropped up dedicated to wiping out the remnants of the Mythic Dawn.
Ah, and of course, a bonus, for killing Vici while she addressed her guests, as instructed. Gold... simple and pure. Spend it as you will.
As a mortal, Malyn's soul was black, so part of his work was breaking past Azura's rules. He was close before... well, I already told you.
As time passed, our luck would diminish to the point of non-existence. And whether you know it or not, our uncanny luck defines our trade.
At least poor Sinderion died doing what he loved, his field research. I told the old fool he should take it easy, but he was too stubborn.
Before we wage war upon our foes, we must wage a war against our lesser selves. Cleave to your higher voice and with it shatter your foes.
But please, don't let me keep you. Proceed to the kitchens straight away. Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival.
But that's what we promised Ulfric and his men. It seems foolish looking back, but at the time we were hoping the Elves wouldn't find out.
But their cruelty was too great for men to bear, and they rose up in what would be called the Dragon War and the Cult swept from the land.
But why? Why, pray tell, have I received word that Anton Virane is still walking around Markarth, hale and healthy as the day he was born?
Care to take a look around? This is not, I dare say, the Solitude botanical gardens. Have you any idea where you are? Where you truly are?
Cold as the inside of an ice wraith. That and some Imperials are camped out around the entrance, staying nice and warm around their fires.
Constance don't care much for strangers in the orphanage. Afraid someone might hurt one of us kids. Which, I gotta admit, is kind of nice.
Did you spot the Dwarven ruins up there? Mzinfazzle, Finchafft, Mzinchaleft? Good thing the Dwarves disappeared and stopped naming things.
Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with him being here all the time. He mostly keeps to himself, and so far he's been able to pay.
Don't misunderstand me, friend. I like my quiet, and I like to read. But you trifle with my ship, my crew, or my captain? I will kill you.
Excellent. Very good. This is exactly what I need to complete a series of studies I'm doing on Dwemer craftsmanship and magical resonance.
First off, there's a damn Orc hanging around getting in the way. He's been yammering on about needing help with some kind of vision quest.
First, I need to know what the Imperials are planning. Need to slip into their headquarters, grab plans, maps, something useful like that.
Go to the farm - the Loreius Farm. Just over there, off the road. Talk to Loreius. He has tools! He can help me! But he won't! He refuses!
Going way back to King Harald's time or even before, the High King always wore the Jagged Crown. It was the symbol of his might and power.
He opened the gate for Ulfric Stormcloak. Ulfric rides in, defeats the High King and Roggvir was the one that let him ride right back out.
Head to the Riften jail and talk to Sibbi. Get him to tell you where Frost and his Lineage Papers are and bring them to me outside Riften.
Here you are. I added a little mead into the recipe. I think it tastes better. Let me know what you think tomorrow, I'll make another one.
Here, how about a little token for your efforts? My family's ring and all the things the guards confiscated from you when you were jailed.
Here's your payment for Solitude. Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.
His family's involvement was only found out well after the crisis had died down, but it still ruined their reputation. They were outcasts.
I am the one cursed by Malacath. It is my burden. I bear it, and continue to lead, and the others see how strong I am. That is how I rule.
I don't like Imperial troops holed up in Winterhold... such a close march to Windhelm. So I'm sending a campaign up there to take it back.
I have come to rely heavily upon you. It is only fitting that you join the upper echelon. I am hereby elevating you to the rank of Legate.
I hooked up with a guild in Valenwood... I think they called themselves the Silver Crescents. Spent quite a few years doing jobs for them.
I said not anymore. Orthorn stole a number of books when he ran off to Fellglow Keep to join those Summoners. Some kind of peace offering.
I think Giraud here would give you the best explanation of both it and the history of King Olaf's Verse. You should speak to him about it.
I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere,that is.
I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-brother to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain.
I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually. I daresay, the most important work your organization has had in, well... centuries.
I... I need time to think about all this. Go see Nazir - do some work for him. I'll find you when I'm ready to discuss the matter further.
I'll present you as the sacrifice. Just play along. While mother begins the ritual, I'll strike. Then, together we can... we can kill her.
I'm not forcing him to stay here. I know that he wants a life of adventure, but I've told him before that I can't afford to buy him armor.
I'm not sure that it's news, but lately it seems like every blacksmith in Skyrim is out to prove that he's the equal of Eorlund Gray-Mane.
I'm not sure. I hoped that maybe if she could be found, if he had some sort of explanation, that maybe he could put himself back together.
I'm old enough to decide how to live my life, and I'd be honored to wear your armor, if you'd just let me. I'm strong enough to handle it.
I'm originally from Cyrodiil, sent here at the request of the Emperor himself. I'm often ordered to places with problems that need fixing.
I'm sorry. Keep the ring. I cannot bear the weight of them in my heart, and I must make the journey alone now. Thank you for... thank you.
I've picked up a few tricks by reading the tomes scattered all over the shop, but I don't have the knack to pull half of the formulas off.
If either group goes through less official channels and attempt to contact you directly, please refer them to the College's Master Wizard.
If that fails, follow him and see what he's up to. If I know Gulum-Ei, he's in way over his head and you'll be able to use it as leverage.
If the hold is faced with any threats or mysteries of a magical nature, I am called upon to explain things and suggest a course of action.
If we don't do something, the enchantment will eventually fade, and the Star will slip back into Oblivion. Azura will have the last laugh.
If you happen upon any of our caravans in your travels, we'd also be more than willing to pay you a fair sum for any of your stolen goods.
In a fight, if you see a big wind up, get out of the way or bash him with your shield. Attacks like that go right through a regular block.
In fact, the Mages Guild was founded in opposition to the idea of the Psijic Order, that only an elite few should have control over magic.
It is a pity, but it cannot be helped. Perhaps if we continue to show that we can be trusted, they will open their cities to our caravans.
It'll take years, but I'll organize the Forsworn again. We'll reclaim our land, and then, when power is ours, we'll have peace. A kingdom.
Justice demands that he die for his crimes. Until he is dead, I'm afraid my oath as a Blade prevents me from offering you aid and comfort.
Lacking the heart of a dead god myself, I was attempting to substitute a rather specific soul gem. The ahh, the one you helped me acquire.
Lately, they've been threatening to send my whole family into exile if we're caught collaborating with the Empire. They think we're spies!
Long ago, I was an orphan on the streets of Corinthe. I stowed away aboard a trade ship that brought me here. It was Ri'saad who found me.
Look, it ain't my business ta tell the Dark Brotherhood its business, but if you killed a member of the Elder Council, you'd better belie-
Look, um... Thanks. And I'm sorry for my unneighborly reaction. If you talk to Cicero, you be sure and tell him I'll be down to help soon.
Many of the dovahhe are now scattered across Keizaal. Without Alduin's lordship, they may yet bow to the vahzen... rightness of my Thu'um.
Maven Black-Briar wants me to keep the mead flowing and that's what I aim to do despite all these lazy good-for-nothings that work for us.
Me, I have been part of the Dark Brotherhood from the day I first hatched. I am a Shadowscale, you see. Born under the sign of the Shadow.
Mistress, the people of Solitude are destitute. Many are starving and desperate for work. We need to be more active, to reach out to them.
Names have power, lad. You should know by now. Just say [QUOTE]Velehk Sain, I release you.[QUOTE], and [QUOTE]Poof![QUOTE], I'm on my way.
Never been to Whiterun before? The Jarl's palace is something to see. Dragonsreach they call it. Big old dragon skull hanging on the wall.
No, don't tell me. I don't want to know. Look, we need to keep this quiet... between you and me, okay. No one else needs to know about it.
No, no, no. What I need to do is to reverse that. Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent and then apply it with the proper incantation.
Not far, not far. This one looks upon it on clear days. Look to the west, at the foot of the mountain. The Dwarven ruins there. Bthardamz.
Oh, but don't misunderstand. I'm not criticizing. It was a good kill. Old crone had it coming. And you saved a group of urchins, to boot. 
Okay, okay! I'll leave him alone! I was just kidding around. Besides, if he'd only kiss me, I wouldn't have to beat him up all the time...
People say Skyrim is one of the most dangerous places in Tamriel. I think they're wrong... it's magnificent and I'm proud to call it home.
Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. Your best and least painful course of action is to apologize and promise to leave my family in peace.
Please. You find out why that woman was attacked, who's behind Weylin and the Forsworn, and I'll pay you for any information you bring me.
Riften will be handed over to Imperial control. Jarl Laila Law-Giver will step down, and Maven Black-Briar will become the Jarl of Riften.
Riften's biggest exports used to be fishing and honey, until the Black-Briar family moved in. Now the meadery is the biggest game in town.
Rjorn was always looking for new stories to tell. It seems he was writing a lay about Halldir when he vanished. That was the missing clue.
Sadly, the Empire's stretched a little thin these days, and we've gotten very few reinforcements. So we've been forced to recruit locally.
Second, we have the [QUOTE]White-Gold Tower[QUOTE] which is heavy cream with a layer of blended mead, lavender and dragon's tongue on top.
Secondly, we're mounting an attack on the Fort. I want to gain a fortified position here before we launch our final attack on the capital.
She may be young, but Elisif is the Jarl by right. And here in Skyrim, if nothing else, we respect the traditions of our father's fathers.
Speak with the Scheming Servant at the Keep in Markarth. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Tell you what. Go along with his plans for now. I'll keep an eye on you both and, when the time is right, I'll settle accounts with Louis.
Thank goodness mother is keeping a level head about everything. If my brother Saerlund had his way, we'd be flying Imperial colors by now.
Thank you, hero. Now I may finally rest. Take Hevnoraak's iron mask. It may be of use to you, and serve as some reward for your feat here.
The East Empire Company has interests all across Tamriel, inside and outside the Empire's borders. We try not to get involved in politics.
The Empire to bend its knee before those evil elf bastards? Signing a treaty meant to kill the heart of the Empire itself. To deny Talos? 
The Empire would have us become their slaves as they have become slaves to the Thalmor. I will not live as a slave, nor will I die as one.
The only thing I'll tell you about Markarth is stay out of our business. We have enough around here without some outsider causing trouble.
The people here look to Brina Merilis when they need things settled. Real firebrand going up. Wasn't surprised when she joined the Legion.
There are some that say the Dark Brotherhood is back, and stronger than ever. That they've made Dawnstar their home. Tell me - am I wrong?
There you go. Take a look around, there should be plenty of gear to choose from. I'm going to see if I can find something for these burns.
There's been no word from the remnants of the Summerset Shadows, so I'm assuming you either eliminated all of them or they've fled Skyrim.
They were mighty, in their day. Even to attempt to defeat Alduin...  sahrot hunne. The Nords have had many heroes since, but none greater.
Those damned Battle-Borns... they know something. They're hiding it. They practically taunt us with it. They must have some sort of proof!
Vaermina resides in a strange realm known as Quagmire... a nightmarish land where reality shifts upon itself in seemingly impossible ways.
We fight to make our land great once more, to raise up strong, noble thanes, and lay low false Jarls and the cowards who hide behind them.
We know a great deal about the situation and the threat that Alduin poses to us all. You need us here if you want this council to succeed.
We re-founded the Aldmeri Dominion, an alliance between us and our Bosmer cousins. You might know them from their common name. Wood elves.
We were as close as kinsmen, and when Rorik returned home I came with him. I am happy to spend my twilight years here with my good friend.
We were forced to arrest all of them. Ulfric Stormcloak, their leader, used the whole thing as proof that the Empire had abandoned Skyrim.
We're looking to recover an heirloom for a client. They claim ownership of it, and as long as they're paying we don't really care. You in?
Well... I suppose important research is worth every coin. All right. You have yourself a deal. How's double and a half its value in trade?
When the fighting began over the White-Gold Concordat, she ran off to join the Stormcloaks. She had her father's fire, how could I say no?
When will you open your eyes and realize how little my actions differ from yours?  Both of us lie, cheat and steal to further our own end.
Years ago, the Guild used to have a foothold in every major city in Skyrim. You wouldn't dare even lift an apple without checkin' with us.
You can give this house a once over. I hear they're fairly well-off and probably have lots of good stuff ripe for the picking. Sound good?
You can run, obviously, but you'll still have a price on your head. If a guard attacks, you can attempt to yield by sheathing your weapon.
You give me too much credit. For how could I fail? I am, after all, just a little girl. What threat could I possibly pose? He he he he he.
You've done a great service to the Silver-Blood family. I've had the Jarl officially pardon you, and taken care of a few other loose ends.
A pity. You have any idea how much fangs would be worth? Or even better -- bottle their flame. The right buyer would pay an immense amount.
After the disaster at Red Mountain, where the Nord army was annihilated, he spent many years pondering the meaning of that terrible defeat.
After twenty years of fighting, she had raised armies of the dead, led by vampire generals. If she returns to power, nobody could stop her.
Ah, this must be that weapon for the Jarl. Poor girl, so eager to prove herself. I'll present it to Balgruuf when his mood is... agreeable.
Ahhh, I see. I think I know just what you need. I don't have anything like that here now, but my Eorlund - he can make you one right quick.
All the crime and corruption in Riften is really getting to him... and now that we hear rumors about the dragons, he's been very depressed.
And a sound, too. Distinct and indistinct. Not thunder... something else. Something I should recognize, but in the dream I cannot place it.
And finally take the fact that the College is the only thing left standing after most of Winterhold was destroyed. It's all fairly damning.
And of course, as the war drags on and supplies run low, our ample fields and stores of food will make a tempting target for desperate men.
Anyway, I'm glad you're here. We're outnumbered again, more so than when we took that wagon. But if we work together, we can pull this off.
Been talk of a little boy in Windhelm, name of Aventus Aretino. Get this - he's been trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. Foolish lad...
Before he left, he said he was going to do the Black Sacrament. You know, to call the Dark Brotherhood. So they'd come and kill old Grelod!
Best yet, the Emperor will be lulled into a false sense of security, thinking an assassination plot had already been discovered and foiled.
But learning a Word of Power is only the first step... you must unlock its meaning through constant practice in order to use it in a Shout.
But never mind that, you did the job and you did it well. Best of all, there's more where that came from... if you think you can handle it.
But they send the Legion to places that've gotten too bad to be settled without violence. What's hard is seeing good people warped by evil.
By holding onto Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. Ulfric will try for it soon. We'll be there to stop him.
By now I can barely contain his power, much less defeat him if he awakens. But with the help of a living champion I may be able to succeed.
Do you realize how delicate the experiment is you've interrupted by sending for me? I may need to throw out the components and start again.
Don't let my appearance throw you off. I'm older than you. A lot older. Getting bitten by a vampire when you're ten will do that to a girl.
Draugr creeping down the mountain to climb through my window at night, that kind of thing. I admit, I still don't much like the look of it.
Elvali died here. I don't even remember what killed her. One of the countless faceless horrors. I think she was glad, in that final moment.
First on my list, is a problem with our supply caravans being constantly harassed by a giant. Need to deal with that hairy brute. And soon.
Forsworn attack the mines, and suddenly all these sellswords show up to [QUOTE]help.[QUOTE] They won't let anyone work until I sell it off.
Funny you should ask. I'm in the market for a new locket. Something in polished silver, maybe. Big enough to hold, say, a folded-up letter?
He showed me a way to grind up ice wraith teeth and use it as a preservative. Keeps everything cold and fresh, but only for a limited time.
He's a traitor, plain and simple. Had I been sitting on the throne, he'd be hanging from the gallows for his sympathies towards the Empire.
Her daughter was sent to Whiterun, the skirmishes there have been violent. The whiterun legate, he needed to know the Stormcloak positions.
Here's your payment. And... a little something else, as well. From me. Consider it my way of apologizing. For being so damned curmudgeonly!
However, I'm disappointed to hear that you fled from the field of battle. We do not reward cowardice in the Legion. I expect better of you.
I don't think it's worth our time with the war going on, but if you want to clear out the cave, I'll make sure you're repaid for your work.
I doubt he's forgiven me for leaving. And for... well, for what he'd consider blasphemy. Using Shouts for anything but worship of Kynareth.
I expect that you'll distance yourself from the affairs of state. In other words, keep your nose out of my business and we'll do just fine.
I guess they thought a woman wasn't strong enough to hurt him. I didn't mean for him to die! Why would I want that? I just... lost control.
I have devoted my life to the Elder Scrolls, but their knowledge is a passing awareness when compared to the encompassing mind of divinity.
I have no authority to negotiate a permanent settlement, unless Ulfric is ready to sue for peace and turn himself over to Imperial justice.
I just finished giving my old war companion, Berit, a proper burial by fire. Old hard head hated the idea of being lost cold in the ground.
I left for a few days in Riften. When I came back Bashnag accused me of trying to sell him out to the Thalmor. I was cursed and chased off.
I present the two of you with these matching rings, blessed by Mara's divine grace. May they protect each of you in your new life together.
I should be asking you the same question, but all right. I'll cook. Here, try this, and don't you dare ask for another one before tomorrow.
I spend a lot of time at the market stalls so I can learn the merchant's trade.  I need more experience if I'm going to run an inn someday.
I was recruited by the Dark Brotherhood, and have been here ever since. I met my husband Arnbjorn, rose to leadership. And now here we are.
I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere, that is.
I'm a Thane. In the future, you may want to gain that information before talking with someone. Risk of looking like an idiot, and all that.
I'm no happier about this than you are, but I don't want the see the Thalmor rounding up people in the streets and throwing them in prison.
I've been enjoying this journey with you. Not for the wealth we've accumulated, but just being carry Mara's will to every corner of Skyrim.
I've been informed by my steward that you've made quite an impression in the Rift; several of our citizens have expressed their admiration.
I've seen bigger houses, but it's yours, so I like it. Now, I think I need something to do if you're ever away, so I'll be opening a store.
I've tried repeatedly to eradicate that meddler, but he has ears within the city guard. Gives us the slip every time we raid the warehouse.
If they were easy to kill, don't you think we would have done it years ago? If our men aren't out in a few minutes, they're dead, trust me.
If you can get onboard that ship. Kill Titus Mede II, as contracted... I will reveal the location of the dead drop that holds your payment.
If you want some heavy armor, I might have a deal we could work out. I need a Daedra's Heart. Jarl wants me to cool his new sword in blood.
It was a mistake, and now I want back what I gave him. It's an amulet that belonged to my family, and I never should've given it to Enthir.
Listen, could you take the sword to my father, Proventus Avenicci? He's the Jarl's steward. He'll know the right time to present it to him.
Mallory is an expert [QUOTE]obtainer of goods.[QUOTE] We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, eh?
Many are our lord's lofty names, but they befit only us mortals. Intone her mighty names from now until the end of time - it is for naught.
Many Orcs leave the stronghold to join the Legion. They welcome our skill in battle and smithing, and we welcome a chance to see the world.
Mjoll the Lioness used to adventure across Skyrim before she settled down in Riften. I hear it all ended when she lost her enchanted blade.
My greatest challenge was deciding which weapon to use, for I am prone to indecision. Bow, dagger... axe? In the end, I opted for my claws.
My job at the Riften Fishery is in danger. The owner, Bolli, said that if I show up for work in this condition one more time, then I'm out.
My mother is the Priestess of Talos. She tends to the shrine and teaches his ways. I'm just not so sure she's delivering the right message.
My n'wah of a father thought he could pull my strings... [QUOTE]continue the Hlaalu tradition.[QUOTE] Bah! I left all that nonsense behind.
My... associate here will be pleased to see your handiwork. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me.
Names have power, lass. You should know by now. Just say [QUOTE]Velehk Sain, I release you.[QUOTE], and [QUOTE]Poof![QUOTE], I'm on my way.
Oh, Asgeir! My husband! My dear, sweet husband! Why would someone do this to you? Why? This was supposed to be the happiest day of my life!
Oh, stop being such a grouch! Not every visitor to the farm wants to burn it down! Maybe they just want to have a nice supper with us, hmm?
Okay, well... I guess it's possible. I've been selling my sword arm for years now. Killed a lot of people. Could be someone wanted revenge.
Once, I was a Shadowscale. An assassin in service to the King of Black Marsh. Trained by the Dark Brotherhood since the day of my hatching.
Our son or daughter isn't going to get much Redguard culture here in Skyrim. I know my wife worries how she will pass along her traditions.
Queen of Solitude, granddaughter of Emperor Uriel Septim II, five hundred years ago. Her fight for succession nearly tore the empire apart.
Quite. Yet that recent business with the young officer. Maro, was it? How dreadful. The son of your commander, plotting your assassination.
Remember, this isn't Stormcloak territory. If we're ahead of the news from Helgen we should be fine as long as we don't do anything stupid.
Sadly, the Oblivion Crisis took its toll on Winterhold, in more ways than one. Then, the Great Collapse swallowed most of our beloved city.
Seems Brina Merilis and the Legion came and now she's Jarl. That's a relief. I don't like the fighting, but Brina is the woman for the job.
She uses a very secret blend of spices, fresh honey from Goldenglow Estate and specially constructed aging casks to ensure the best flavor.
Since he's apparently occupied, and I will need to see this discovery for myself, I think perhaps you should begin researching the subject.
So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to leave. That's right. I'm done. Holiday... complete. Time to return to the hum drum day-to-day.
Tell Cicero the time has come. Tell him the words he has been waiting for, all these years: [QUOTE]Darkness rises when silence dies.[QUOTE]
Thank you for saving me from Alva. I was completely under her evil spell. I'll never forgive myself for what happened to Helgi and my wife.
That said, some of the Legion's staunchest men have organized themselves, and are operating out of hidden military camps in the wilderness.
That's... that's good of you. If you were to save her, I would be very grateful. I don't think there's anything I could give you, though...
The cut he's supposed to provide the Guild has dwindled as of late. He says pickings in the warehouse are slim, but I'm certain he's lying.
The guards have been saying things about you... That you're the one that... Well... They say the Dark Brotherhood... Well. Never mind. Sir.
The longer it remains here, the more dangerous the situation becomes. And so I have come here personally to tell you it must be dealt with.
Then it is settled. The Jarl will continue to rule Solitude, I will garrison armies here to ward off Imperial attempts to reclaim the city.
There are no secrets here, my curious friend. Our prosperity is simply the result of hard work, good fortune and the blessings of the gods.
There will be peace for a time, during which we must rebuild Skyrim into the land it once was. Strong. Self-reliant. The center of mankind.
There's nothing else to talk about, unless the Empire is finally ready to renounce its unjust claim to rule over the free people of Skyrim.
Thieves used to hole up in Fort Snowhawk there, but they were run out. Wizards, they say. Suits me fine, so long as they mind their own by.
Today we live by our own rules. We're the last Sanctuary in all of Tamriel, and only by forgoing the old ways have we survived for so long.
Two hundred years ago, I would have lain down my life for the Unholy Matron. But that is an age long since passed. Astrid is my matron now.
Ulfric only cares about one thing... Ulfric. He's ordained himself the future High King of Skyrim and steps on anyone that gets in his way.
Ulfric Stormcloak would say that I owe my allegiance to the Nord people as they fight for Skyrim's independence. Perhaps this is also true.
Ulfric thinks he can hide behind the walls of his castle. But we will fight our way in and drag him out through the rubble to face justice.
We have something of a vampire problem. Bodies have been found with blood drained. I know of a den nearby you can wipe out as a precaution.
We recently heard she'd been killed... I... I find it difficult to talk about. Perhaps you'd be better off speaking to my parents about it.
Well, get to it then. Pick your guest, and send the poor fool to the Void.  I'll give you the key to this shack, and you'll be on your way.
Well, I never thought I'd see the Guild this way ever again. The place is growin' into what it used to be when Gallus was runnin' the show.
What?! This is exactly why... don't they understand it's hard enough to fight a war without these juvenile attempts to undermine authority?
When I found this town, with its huge cemetery, I felt right at home. I opened the shop and I've never looked back. This is where I belong.
When possible, we ask applicants to perform tasks the college needs completed. In this case, I do have a task befitting an aspiring bard...
When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn't stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form.
When the other guy has his shield up, regular blows are useless. Wind up and hit him with a really powerful attack to get past that shield.
When things started goin' downhill around here, it became difficult to keep it all together. We lost fences, influential contacts and coin.
Word is Elenwen's furious. Big party at the Thalmor Embassy, and one of the guests went someplace they shouldn't. Caused quite a commotion.
Worse still, to pay for the privilege to keep his throne, the Emperor sells Skyrim and our very gods - Talos, no less! - to the damn elves.
Yes, do not underestimate Cicero. A man like that, small and foolish, is easy to mock. To underestimate. Don't make the same mistake I did.
Yes, if someone were to put out the Lighthouse fire and then meet me on the docks afterwards... I could certainly direct them to that loot.
Yes. According to Giraud, our histories keeper, the portion of the Edda dealing with King Olaf might still exist in the Dead Man's Respite.
Yes. Gaius Maro, on orders from his father, arranged for the Gourmet to come to Skyrim months ago. To serve as the Emperor's personal chef.
You disappoint me. I expected someone from outside Riften to be different, but I see corruption's reach holds little regard for boundaries.
You hear the news? The Emperor has been murdered! Right here, in Skyrim. By the gods, if the Dark Brotherhood can do that, nobody's safe...
You mean the wedding? My cousin's apparent murder? An unfortunate misunderstanding, no more. Cold mead, hot tempers... these things happen.
You should have seen me at the height of my adventuring career... I was fearless and took too many risks. But that's what it was all about.
You, an assassin for the Dark Brotherhood, have just made an attempt on the Emperor's life. Would have succeeded, had it been the real man.
You'd be saving my life. Again. I know I probably seemed ungrateful... I've just been so scared. Expecting a knife at my throat any minute.
You're not tiresome like the rest of the people I have the displeasure of dealing with on a regular basis. Here. I'd like you to have this.
You're the one all the guards are talking about. You went into that Sanctuary... wiped out the Dark Brotherhood! Friend, I owe you a drink.
You've done a great thing, today. It doesn't matter who you support in the war; Potema would have been a blight on the land for both sides.
All right, so maybe I was wrong. Maybe Cicero coming here wasn't the best thing that could have happened. But even I didn't anticipate this.
And far to the west lies a ruin. Volskygge. Inside, there is said to be a wall, black as night. And it speaks! In the ancient Dragon tongue!
And if an assassin slips past the night watch, we won't have a Jarl at all. Without Balgruuf's leadership, Whiterun will descend into chaos.
And if, along the way, my message about the dangers of magic should happen to sink in for a few students, that would be a happy coincidence.
And so have I. What's the point of paying anyway? Your outfit can't even fend for itself. I could do better tossing the gold into the sewer.
Are you willing to trade away all claims and titles of your former life? To live here and devote yourself to protecting Tamriel from danger?
As for work, you could try to catch Skald in a good mood, but your best bet would be working in the mines. They're on opposite ends of town.
As you can see, I have much that requires my attention. If you're inclined to gab, there are some nice prison guards you may like to meet...
Aye. I feared that was the case. From that last entry in Gallus's diary, it looks like he was getting close to exposing Mercer to the Guild.
But by Sithis, I hope I'm making the right choice here. You may be an effective killer, but your command of guile leaves much to be desired.
But I've seen first hand what Ulfric is capable of, given the chance. Suffice it to say, he is no friend to Markarth, and no friend of mine.
But if you're willing to work, and you prove to be reliable, I might deem you worthy to live here. My steward will handle things from there.
But only half right. I'm a mad god. The Mad God, actually. It's a family title. Gets passed down from me to myself every few thousand years.
But what you fail to realize is that you involved yourself in this [QUOTE]insanity[QUOTE] when you took Grelod's life. You made your choice.
Captain Volf of the Dainty Sload has decided to test my patience on this matter by neglecting to honor a trade agreement we had established.
Cowards, the both of you. My father would not sit idly back and wait while evil men take over his lands. We're done discussing this for now.
Damn fool doesn't have the coin to pay me back, so he just beats himself up over it, and then he gets thirsty, and it cycles all over again.
Dorthe, listen to me. Your father and your friend may treat you like a boy, but you're not. Do you understand? So please. Be a girl. For me.
Ever taken a swim in the Illinalta? Take care you don't get nipped if you do. Folk say it's teeming with slaughterfish. Who knows what else.
Ever wonder if maybe we should a call a truce with the Imperials and join forces for just a little while take care of some of these dragons?
Have you seen the man? He's completely out of his head. A jester? Here, in Skyrim? Ain't been a merryman in these parts for a hundred years.
He did it. He actually managed to trap his own soul inside the Star, but it's falling apart. It needs more and more souls to sustain itself.
He said he'd even gone to Riften to try and find the bastard. I think maybe he was hoping they'd just kill him, and that'd be the end of it.
Helgird's taken the body into the Hall of the Dead to prepare for burial. She's a little crazy, but if she knows anything, it's dead bodies.
Hmph. Fine. Suit yourself. But you're wrong, anyway. Just look at the fool. I don't know what it is, but he's damn well guilty of something.
I am a child of Hammerfell, born of the sands of the mighty Alik'r. In that great desert, blood is a shade of crimson I can scarce describe.
I still can't figure out why you stole her. You left a note explaining it, but half of it was gibberish and the rest had mead spilled on it.
I suppose if you're intent on looking for the staff, there's a chance they might be in Mzulft yet. Just don't expect them to be cooperative.
I suppose she's Jarl Elisif now. She married High King Torygg just before Ulfric killed him. The Empire supports her claim to be High Queen.
I thought it would be better to leave some of the details out of our previous discussion. Didn't want to risk you walking away from the job.
I understand, Listener. And I hope you understand that until the fine is paid, I must insist you refrain from all Dark Brotherhood business.
I'll put it plainly. You can claim your sword, or you can keep your wife. If you set foot outside the gate, I won't be here when you return.
I'm afraid not, little fairy. The fruit has about another day left before it spoils. We've got to sell as much as we can, as soon as we can.
I'm losing my patience with this damn war. We must take Hjaalmarch back! The Stormcloaks will be beating upon the doors of the capital soon.
If not for Talos, and a few modest bribes paid to the right jailors, why, I would not be standing before you today, resplendent in my faith!
In his later years, Andoril moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild. He prefered the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments.
In the end, I relied on a woman's natural weapons - beauty and seduction. The rest was a formality. Though, a rather wet, messy formality...
It drove him mad. Students started dying. Eventually, the College exiled him. He took a few loyal disciples to Ilinalta's Deep and vanished.
It is an... artifact from outside time. It does not exist, but it has always existed. Rah wahlaan. They are...hmm... fragments of creation. 
It's a shocking request, I know. But it is inside the purview of what you Dark Brotherhood types do. Isn't it? If history is to be believed?
It's quite romantic, if you're an alchemist. Frost took the old fool a few seasons back, while he was looking for the Ring of Pure Mixtures.
It's too bad the Burning of King Olaf was called off this year. I think some of the younger bards would really have gotten a kick out of it.
Killing Commander Maro would do no good. Someone would merely replace him. No, we need him to remain in charge. But... distracted. Weakened.
Last, and only for the bravest of souls, we have the [QUOTE]Cliff Racer[QUOTE] which is Firebrand Wine, Cyrodiilic Brandy, Flin and Sujamma.
Look at me ramble... Well, I guess I'll go about my business sulking in here. You can stand over there in the corner watching for assassins.
Look, everything was all just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to tell Brynjolf to go jump off the pier. You'll tell him I said sorry, yes?
Mallory is an expert [QUOTE]obtainer of goods.[QUOTE] We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, hmm?
Many of the disgruntled natives of the Reach used the opportunity to depose the Empire, and founded what they called an independent kingdom.
Mark my words, the war will be over in a matter of months. Once Ulfric sees the full might of the Empire, I'm sure he'll come to his senses.
Maybe you need a partner? Hmm? Just picture it. Two women, the dusty road, strapping men at every tavern, a fortune in gold to be claimed...
Maybe you've seen masts sticking out of the water to the northeast? That would be the wreck of the Winter War. Fine vessel, back in its day.
Nirnroot is the easiest. It grows only by the water and makes a unique chiming noise. The only drawback is it won't regrow after harvesting.
Now, maybe I don't pick up a blade in Ulfric's name no more, but I still hold with his ideals. Skyrim is Nord land, and we ought to rule it.
Now, since we're not the Dark Brotherhood, we're not going to kill him, we're just going to make sure he sits in the prisons for a few days.
Oh dearest, who cares? So your husband is a lout. The work you do here, with me, is invaluable. The people of Whiterun know your true worth.
Oh, this is going to be fun. You've got to use your Wabbajack to defeat the enemy while - get this - they use their Wabbajack to defeat you!
On this day, our enemy will know the fullness of our determination, the true depth of our anger, and the exalted righteousness of our cause.
One of the guards said he saw a mage appear out of thin air. Claimed it was one of those Psijic Monks. Man's been hitting the skooma, I say.
One of these groups found Mehrunes' Razor, the artifact of Dagon. They split it into three fragments and pledged to keep them apart forever.
Only in that I'm a graduate. I work at here at the Winking Skeever. I would highly recommend it though. Talk to Viarmo if you're interested.
See, my grandfather was a wizard. My father wouldn't talk about him much. But I found some of his things in the attic. Including this staff.
See, that kind of attitude comes from someone who wants to get rich and stay alive long enough to enjoy it. We're goin' to get along nicely.
So it would appear. Though I'd suspect she'd want you to complete your other contracts first. Do those, then we'll talk about something new.
So you're the... the assassin? I need you to kill the Visiting Noble at Dragonsreach, in Whiterun. Here's the gold. I... I hope it's enough.
Something about using frost magic to chill the mead for a certain period of time. I felt it was a waste, but the Arch-Mage let them proceed.
Stop. Turn around. And go back the way you came. Astrid is waiting for you. She's down near the entrance. You must have passed right by her.
Tell you what. You release me, and I promise my associates won't hunt you down like an animal and butcher you in the street. It's a win-win.
Thalmor got their embassy up that way. If I had my way, the lot of those yellowback elves would wake up in a box back to Summerset tomorrow.
The Emperor's hand will be forced. He'll have to travel to Skyrim to deal with the aftermath... and he'll find the Dark Brotherhood waiting.
The Empire might send over a few Legionnaires to make sure we're serious, and of course, we'll be taking the fight to the elves soon enough.
The lover will likely be your target. If memory serves me correctly, he leads a group of bandits. So this may be rather interesting for you.
The only mistake was you showing your face. You've committed crimes against Skyrim and her people, and it's time to face the Jarl's justice.
The Prince of Plots usually gets what she wants. I'm surprised I'm not dead already. She must have had some reason to keep me alive so long.
Then one day I walked in and Malyn had... killed a student, and in a horrific moment of inspiration, he started using her soul for his work.
These Stormcloaks are ridiculous. They won't shop here because they think I'll sell them poisoned tonics. I should just go back to Cyrodiil.
Thinking of asking the General for some training books. Give the soldiers something to do while they're on rest. Something besides drinking.
This house is huge. I'll be tripping my feet all over this place. Hey, I think I'll start a little business here. Something to do, you know?
Through this gate, just beside my quarters, is a tunnel. A tunnel that leads right through the old Dwarven ruins of Markarth, into the city.
Trust me, there's no need to be afraid. Think of Tiber Septim. Do you think he'd have founded the Empire if he'd listened to the Greybeards?
Typical Imperial rot. You speak of Skyrim like you know the land, know its people. You're from Cyrodiil! You know nothing about us! Nothing!
Ulfric murdered Torygg, you know. Walked right into his palace in Solitude and killed him. Shouted him to death, if you believe the stories.
Unfortunately, in your zeal, you failed to eliminate Vici while she addressed her guests, as directed. I'm sorry, but your bonus is forfeit.
We were taking him to the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun, just so the healers could make sure he was in good health, and they say he's fine.
We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good. We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep.
Welcome to the deceptively verdant mind of the Emperor Pelagius III. That's right! You're in the head of a dead, homicidally insane monarch.
Well... It's your son. Nelkir. The boy has been acting increasingly peculiar. Moreso than normal, I mean. Something really should be done...
When a client needs us to eliminate another, we don't operate like the Dark Brotherhood. We find alternate means to get them out of the way.
While technically in charge of the College, the Arch-Mage's responsibilities often keep him occupied. Thus, I run the day-to-day operations.
Who do you think brought Septimus here? Who do you think protected you on your journey to open the box and loose my knowledge on this world?
Windhelm is one of the oldest human cities in all of Tamriel. In fact, it was the capital of the First Empire, which was founded by Ysgramor
With the war, many more ships come through these docks. Loaded with weapons and pay, but few people. And they pass through dangerous waters.
Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. He's really doing it!
Yes, you. You, who shares my iron tomb, who warms my ancient bones. I give you this task - journey to Volunruud. Speak with Amaund Motierre.
You can help yourself to any drink you find, but bring me the bottle of Dragon's Breath Mead. It's his favorite, so I know he has one there.
You can talk to Birna if you need to buy anything. She doesn't have much, but could certainly use the coin. And then there's our little inn.
You remind me of myself a few years ago. Let me show you a little bit about wearing light armor. It's helped me out whenever I was scouting.
You were ranting when you got here  but most of it was slurred. You did say something about Rorikstead . Maybe you should take a look there.
You'll need to get your hands on some Balmora Blue from Sabine Nyette down by the docks. She's the first mate on another ship, the Red Wave.
You're a real friend saving this mead from her. Here, let me show you how to block a punch that might be coming from some angry spouse, huh?
You're joking. While I can understand if some family members wish to honor the Old Ways once more, surely no one would oppose Astrid's rule.
You're right. Why dilute the glory with too many souls fighting over it? We'll drive out the Empire and be celebrated as heroes when we win.
Your eminence, my scrying has suggested nothing in the area. Dragon Bridge is under imperial control. This is likely superstitious nonsense.
Your mockery will be the end of you. And on that day, another servant will feast on your entrails and discover a ring clenched in her teeth.
Your political affairs are your own, but any allegiance you may have in the ongoing war could very well affect your access to Fort Greymoor.
Your wish is my command! As long as it doesn't involve much physical activity. I seem to be having trouble staying on my feet at the moment.
A devout Nord would rather fall in battle and have his blood spill upon the earth than allow the Empire to strike his name from the divinity.
Absolutely not. That wing has been sealed for hundreds of years, and for good reason. They say the ghost of Pelagius the Mad still haunts it.
After the so-called [QUOTE]battle[QUOTE] of Pale Pass, the Akaviri went into his service. This was the foundation stone of the Second Empire.
Ah, you mentioned something that would convince us the festival should take place but I didn't expect King Olaf's lost verse. Please proceed.
Alright. This here's enough to keep your insides from spilling out, except from the fiercest of blows, and shouldn't weigh you down too much.
Always be prepared. You never know if you might get a split in one, or lose one, then where would you be? No sir, that's not happening to me.
And Betrid Silver-Blood is always asking for more potions to fuel Thonar's [QUOTE]ambitions.[QUOTE] Gives him a temper fiercer than any bear.
And what does the Empire do? Nothing! Nay, worse than nothing! The Imperial machine enforces the will of the Thalmor! Against its own people!
Are you scared of death? I am. I hear everything just stops... forever. It just all goes away, but you don't realize it. I don't want to die.
Arniel wondered if perhaps they'd somehow managed to get themselves lost in the Outer Realms, but I think that's giving them too much credit.
As I said, go speak with Gabriella. She's been assisting me with your next contract. This Emperor business, well... it does involve everyone.
As long as the Empire continues to uphold its treaty obligations, my government does not concern itself with the internal politics of Skyrim.
As you know, Solitude's coffers are much depleted by the war efforts. Thane Erikur, you have a strong head for business. What do you suggest?
Aye, that it has. Trust me, mum - once you've killed a man from a horse, you'll never want to fight on the ground again. Ain't no goin' back.
But it's worse than that. He's taken to locking himself in the Night Mother's chamber, and talking. To someone. In hushed, but frantic tones.
But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and did some kind of dark ritual. He summoned killers to murder old Grelod. He's saved us all.
But Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising has divided us. Now seems we can scarce look at each other without comin' to blows. Petty and foolish, that.
But yes, it's been a lot of work. Vignar doesn't want the change to disrupt the lives of his people. They've got enough to deal with already.
Do you know why Alain was in Windhelm? He heard about Friga's murder. He wanted to befriend the family, in their grief... and rob them blind.
Does she? Listen, sister... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid.
Every Legionnaire's secret weapon lies in this: knowledge of himself. And like any blade, he must be forged between the hammer and the anvil.
Folks in town say that Balimund is the greatest blacksmith in all of Tamriel. I hope I can live up to that some day and make him proud of me.
Fool! Amateur! Without those papers you'll never be able to present yourself as the Gourmet! Off with you! Back to the body to retrieve them!
Frodnar... nobody is going to believe that your dog is a... Frostbite Spider. And if they do... they'll kill him. That's not much of a prank.
Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him.
Ha! And would that surprise anyone? This Sanctuary's a mess. Wouldn't surprise me if somebody's talking to the fool on the sly. Making deals.
Hard to believe it was just a coincidence, that the first dragon anyone's seen for centuries attacks just as Ulfric was about to be executed.
Have you heard the tale of Mathieu Bellamont, and the great treachery of Cheydinhal? Kill a boy's mother, and vengeance festers in the son...
Here's the big picture. He helped Alduin enslave our ancestors. He may have betrayed Alduin in the end, but that makes him worse, not better.
Here's the situation. You attacked my family. So now you're going to apologize.. or I'm going to kill you. I hope we understand each other...
Hevnoraak planned his resurrection obsessively before dying. My duty in life and in death is to make sure he stays in this tomb for eternity.
I don't care if we share the same ancestors, these people are savages. Half of them are Forsworn barbarians, and have you seen what they eat?
I don't need this. My family wasted 8 generations keeping that Razor safe from a dead cult. As far as I care, it can stay locked in my house.
I heard some of the sailors talking about how they stashed a bottle of Double-Distilled Skooma in the Gnisis Cornerclub. I just need a taste.
I killed Torygg to prove our wretched condition. How is the High King supposed to be the defender of Skyrim, if he can't even defend himself?
I mean, the Redguards fought off the Aldmeri and the Empire, and now Hammerfell is an independent state. That's all we Nords want for Skyrim!
I was pretty bad off for a while, but a priest of Mara was passing through on his way to Dawnstar and healed me to the best of his abilities.
I wouldn't say that. But he and Ulfric have been at odds for years, and I'm afraid Balgruuf will end up siding with the Empire because of it.
I'll send my men to secure any of the remaining goods you left behind. We can't have that substance falling into the wrong hands now, can we?
I'm dealing with a few new research proposals, evaluating the results of three long-term projects, and keeping an eye on our new Apprentices.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. Commander Maro is the best the Penitus Oculatus has ever produced. You should be half the man he is.
I've been playing this game for almost 20 years. Sending the young to their deaths. All in the name of the Forsworn. And I'm tired. So tired.
If you can... I want you to kill someone else, as well. You don't have to - not as part of our deal. But if you do... I'll pay you even more.
If you say Cicero has gone there, it stands to reason that he's familiar with the place. That means you'll be fighting him on his own ground.
If you want my opinion, I think they should have paid for an entire quartet. Plenty of bards at the College would have loved the opportunity.
In fact, I need to arrange for someone to pick up an ore sample for me in Shor's Stone... goodness knows Elgrim won't lift a finger to do it.
In my youth I was a fisherman... I had a beautiful ship named [QUOTE]The Brawny Prawn.[QUOTE] But the years have a way of creeping up on you.
Indeed. There have been multiple attempts on the Jarl's life. We're not certain if it's the Dark Brotherhood or simply Imperial sympathizers.
It's a wonder people can get anywhere around here. Maybe I'll avoid this entire hold for awhile. That said... I do have a few things to sell.
It's about time Brynjolf sent me someone with business sense. I was beginning to think he was running some sort of beggar's guild over there.
It's nothing dangerous, so don't worry. I'm not even sure why he wants it, but then that's not really my concern. He's willing to pay for it.
It's said to be spread across four volumes and very hard to come by. My client is offering quite a reward for them, which I'd split with you.
It's where you go if you can't afford a room anywhere else. About the time they opened the mines, someone got the idea to throw beds in here.
Just leave Riften. Go far, far away and never return. This place is nothing but a rotten, stinking corpse that's sat in the sun far too long.
Let me guess - Astrid failed to mention I'm her husband? She has a tendency to do that. Doesn't want the others thinking she plays favorites.
Lucan, I was thinking we should have a grand sale. Lower the prices by half, maybe get some jugglers. We could attract lots of new customers.
My experimentation involves a magical construct and a reagent that will allow the construct to maintain a field of permanent harmonic energy!
My lady... Surely you're not that naive. Such foolishness would only leave us defenseless. The rebels would storm the palace in an afternoon.
Naw... he's fine. Look, I wanted to ask if you'll... um, if you'd like to... well, like to have a drink with me at the Bee and Barb sometime?
Nonsense. That's just an excuse for you to avoid working, and [QUOTE]commune with the greenwood like our fathers of old[QUOTE] and blah blah.
Not yet, no. Although it is true my husband Torygg was the High King, and I am his widow... now is not the time to lay claim to such a title.
Oh, I know enough. I know those trouble-making Stormcloaks refuse to submit to Imperial authority. Such seditious behavior. Why it's treason!
Oh, I know who you are. Don't be so surprised. You ain't the first assassin sent to kill me. Won't be the last. Now let's get this over with.
Oh, well, the Listener is the only person the Night Mother speaks to. It is the highest honor attainable by a member of the Dark Brotherhood.
One of my monks, the elf Orchendor, was sent to gather these Afflicted. He shepherded them into Bthardamz for me, but has since lost his way.
Only trouble is gathering materials has become hazardous. The roads to the mines and to the other cities are thick with bandits... and worse.
Patience, Dorthe. You'll get some time at the forge, I promise you. But not right now. You need to keep watching me. That's how you'll learn.
Pick pockets, knock over houses... heck, I don't care if you have to bust into a palace. You do what you have to do to come up with the coin.
Return to the pretender, tell her I'm dead! Tell her you strangled me with my own intestines! Ha ha! But lie! Yes, lie! Lie, and let me live!
She's always welcome in Mistveil Keep and between you and me, I'm pretty sure she even has some pretty influential friends within the Empire.
So, you've got two options. Try to find Agallon yourself, somewhere on his route between the major cities. Or... find and steal his schedule.
Sorry. Talking about the Scrolls, you usually end up in irritating and vague metaphors like that. Some people who study them devoutly go mad.
Speak with the Indolent Farmer at the Vilemyr Inn, in Ivarstead. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Nervous Patron at Candlehearth Hall, in Windhelm. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Stormcloaks... even the name of their rebellion stinks of Ulfric's vanity. He wants to be king. That's all this is about. One man's ambition.
Take the mighty Dawnbreaker and with it purge corruption from the dark corners of the world. Wield it in my name, that my influence may grow.
That has to be the most brilliant and unexpected solution I've heard in a long time. It solves all of my problems and keeps the field stable!
That's what comes of trying to win a war with a bare handful of legions. If the Emperor would just give me the reinforcements I've requested!
That's what started this whole war. The Empire couldn't ignore that. Once the jarls start killing each other, we're back to the bad old days.
The deepest doors of Dwemer listen for singing. It plays the attitude of notes proper for opening. Can you not hear it? Too low for hearings?
The Fear spell has saved the life of many an Illusion mage. If you could cast it on the seal here on the ground, that would prove your skill.
The guards have been saying things about you... That you're the one that... Well... They say the Dark Brotherhood... Well. Never mind. Ma'am.
The rumors were true! You carry the one weapon Eldergleam fears - Nettlebane. I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it.
The Scrolls exist here, with us, but also beyond and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance so we could know them.
Then it's decided. When this is all over and Delvin's contacts assure me that we've regained our footing in Skyrim, we'll handle the details.
There he devours the souls of the heroic dead to feed his power. You must find his portal to Sovngarde before he returns, stronger than ever.
There is no difference in the dragon tongue between debating and fighting. Shouting comes as naturally to a dragon as breathing, or speaking.
They're after some old guy named Esbern. Something to do with dragons, I gathered it from listening to them talk when they thought I was out.
Though, believe it or not, there are rumors of a weapon that even Eldergleam herself would lift her roots for, more out of fear than respect.
Throw in the Oblivion Crisis, which was caused by magic-users, and the troubles now with the Aldmeri Dominion, who are elves and magic users.
Today I'll teach you a useful spell that might just save your life. If you should ever fall into a river, you'll be very glad you learned it.
Ulfric would expunge from Skyrim citizens whose only crime was to be born of a non-Nordic woman. That is unacceptable to free men everywhere.
Unfortunately, one needs to be able to cast at least Apprentice level spells in any school of magic before being allowed to join the College.
We have garrisons throughout all the provinces of the Empire. Our mission is to serve the Emperor, uphold the law, and protect the citizenry.
We haven't had an adoption in months. At this rate, we'll be stuck with these brats forever. We need to get the word out. A sale, if need be.
Well, I'm also certain you're aware that our own city guard failed to provide the protection required to ensure safe passage of the shipment.
Well, there's an old statue there. I've seen it. Hanging right over where she'll be standing. Old means weak. Weak means it could fall. Hmmm?
Well, this is it, then. Look after yourself, Gaius. You're doing your duty, and I'm proud of you. But you'd better come back to me. You hear?
Well, when I say fetch, I really mean delve into a dangerous ruin in search of an ancient stone tablet that may or may not actually be there.
Well, yes. I mean, no. That is, it might, but I'm not completely sure. I'm no tonal architect, I've only read their writings. Scraps, really.
Well, you wanted to find the man responsible for those killings? You'll have plenty of time with the King in Rags when you're in Cidhna mine.
With me, you kill Skyrim's last hope. Mark my words. You'll all be serving elven masters soon. And know then, that I would have stopped them.
With Nilsine dead, maybe then Tova will realize what she's lost, hmm? Maybe then she'll see that I was just as much a daughter as the others.
With the Skeleton Key missing from the Twilight Sepulcher, I'm afraid Mercer's seen to it that none of us can benefit from Nocturnal's gifts.
Years back, I had to ferret away some booty nearby. We'd sunk an Imperial Galleon off the coast. Good plunder, but we needed to travel light.
Yes. You're killing the Emperor himself. The Dark Brotherhood will get one shot at this, and you've been given the honors. So don't screw up.
You can be a part of a tremendous power - all you have to do is let your soul be absorbed by this axe. I never said it would be your power...
You're the one? From the... the Dark Brotherhood? The man I need killed is a Seasoned Hunter. He's just outside Falkreath. Here's the gold...
...with three beers down, the Orc did frown, and bid the Elf goodbye... ...for none could know, 'twas not for show, and someone had to die... 
Allow me to give you this, the fork I used the first time I tasted one of your dishes. Oh, and these ingredients I've been collecting for you.
Also, I need a peek inside Imperial headquarters, ideally lifting some documents detailing their plans. I need to know what to concentrate on.
And one more thing! I will hear no more talk of adoptions! None of you riff-raff is getting adopted. Ever! Nobody needs you, nobody wants you.
And so, the Gourmet has remained in seclusion, somewhere in Skyrim... on indefinite hold. Probably feels like a prisoner. But you'll fix that.
And that's not all. They took a heap of our lumber, and one tried to have his way with my daughter. They think they can do whatever they want.
And we have an opportunity to slay the rebel field commander. Without a clear command structure, they should fall into confusion and disarray.
And when the elves marched into your beloved Cyrodiil, and everyone took up arms against them, wasn't that treason? Against the Dominion? Huh?
And, there's only one man who can give us what we need - Delvin Mallory. He's a fence, a private operator. Works out of the Ratway, in Riften.
At first they called us that to belittle our cause. But we gladly accept being named for Ulfric Stormcloak, the only true High King of Skyrim.
Brelyna, my dear, why don't you search for warding magics. Anything designed to keep people out. Don't interact with them, just identify them.
Burying the past is much harder than burying remains. I'm... I'm afraid of what you will think of me if I tell you about the things I've done.
But that was a great many years ago, before all the members of the order were called back to the Isle of Artaeum, and it disappeared entirely.
But there's no time. Whatever happened here has affected Winterhold as well. I need you to get out there and make sure everything's all right.
But... I'm sorry, you should go. The children aren't up for adoption, and it's cruel to get their hopes up. Besides, Grelod hates... visitors.
By the gods, you're serious. You'd better report this to Commander Maro right away. He's at the Penitus Oculatus outpost, up in Dragon Bridge.
Cicero's problem isn't his madness. It's an adherence to an ancient, outmoded way of life. The Night Mother's ways... simply are not our ways.
Cross-referencing this with Delphine's map of dragon burial sites, and I believe I've identified one of the dragons that Alduin has raised up.
Depends on what you need. A light armor is good for travel. Less to carry. A heavy armor weighs you down, but no true warrior goes without it.
Dibella teaches love and compassion, but that doesn't mean we're just going to tell you what you want to know and let you walk away from this.
Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the Feeble, in Whiterun.
Does she? Listen, brother... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid.
Don't get me wrong, every country has its dark corners. But that's why we're here. To bring order and civilization, and to protect the people.
Excellent! We've hit 'em where it hurts. Repairs will be needed when we take over, but at least the Stormcloaks won't benefit in the meantime.
From her citadel at the center, she reaches forth to collect our memories, leaving nothing in return apart from visions of horror and despair.
Gemma. This town is called [QUOTE]Kynesgrove.[QUOTE] That stand of trees is Kyne's Grove. You don't honestly think you can just cut some down.
Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Write of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him.
He was a strange Altmer... paid more attention to his research than his own well-being. He lived in the basement of an inn for goodness sakes!
He's been trying to stay out of the war, but it can't last. He's going to have to pick a side. I'm afraid he's going to make the wrong choice.
Here's your gold, with a little extra for hiding the body. Now go see Astrid. The final stage of the contract has come. The Emperor must fall.
I don't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun. Eorlund Gray-Mane's got that honor. Man's steel is legendary. All I ask is a fair chance.
I don't think that's needed, Horik. It's the same strategy we used for every major defense during the Great War. It'll serve just as well now.
I had to use your pay to smooth things over with the client. They didn't want to be associated with a criminal. Next time, don't get arrested.
I have a good thing going here. The Jarl benefits from my more creative arrangements as well, though it'd be impossible for her to admit that.
I know it isn't much, but here, take this bow. It was given to me by my family. It's special to me, but brings back too many painful memories.
I know you will. But all the same, remember everything I said. Stay alert, and when you get to the cities, make your observations and move on.
I know. The poor girl's fright has left her bereft of reason. But there's no talking her out of it. I fear she'll be locked in there for days.
I need you to sneak in there, and free our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the prisoners, head out to the courtyard.
I suppose so. But believe me. Only us servants have a key like that, and its a very expensive looking lock. Really, I wouldn't worry about it.
I trust that you will make the right choice, in the end. Listen to the Voice that Kynareth has placed within you, and your path will be clear.
I work to bring honor to this family, and to the family that I lost. For my mother, my father, and my grandfather. For all my Shield-Siblings.
I'm glad to see you're embracing our methods. It would be a waste to lose a contact at the East Empire Company before we had the entire story.
I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you helping the Jarl, Solitude would be weaker.
If royal blood was spilt, all of Cyrodiil would be up in arms. We can't afford an all out war with the Empire. So we'll bide our time for now.
If you discover Gulum-Ei's holding out on us and has more loot stashed away than he claims, we'd find that information quite valuable as well.
If you're lookin' to get some coin for the fruits of your labor, you should talk to Tonilia. She sounds tough, but she'll cut you a fair deal.
If you're serious, make your way to Solitude. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. You find General Tulius there, commanding our forces in Skyrim.
Is Vignar too old to be Jarl? It's a fair question. If he's grown infirm and is losing his wits, where does that leave the people of Whiterun?
It's good to see the Blades fighting alongside the Dragonborn once again. To think we're treading in the footsteps of thousands of years past.
It's just that papa promised I could make something at the forge. So maybe we could do something together, hmmm... next week? Is... that okay?
It's no secret that my family were once members of the Mythic Dawn. One of my forefathers was even chosen to assassinate Uriel Septim himself.
Lives lost, crops burned, land ruined... there's no greater sin than war. And yet, you were an orphan, and you've made something of your life.
Locked. Damn! One of the hags nearby will have the key. You'll have to take it from here. I'll keep watch here - unless you can pick the lock.
Look, I don't care who asked you to find the Star, but don't take it back to Azura. The Daedra are evil. They're the reason Malyn went insane.
Make your way to our hidden military camp in the Pale. Rikke will have important tasks for you, and will need you when we reclaim the capital.
Mighty Arkay, God of Mortals, hear now the prayers of your humble servant. Bless these departed souls and welcome them into the realms beyond.
My life with the Alik'r is over now, but I have no wish to die in this gods-forsaken land. If I can be released from prison, I may start over.
My... eagerness to meet you in battle was my... undoing, Dovahkiin. I salute your, hmm, low cunning in devising such a grahmindol - strategem.
Never heard of them talking to anybody before. If they really do want to talk to you, you'd better go find out what they want. You never know.
Ni liivrah hin moro. True, this is not the final krongrah - victory. But not even the heroes of old were able to defeat Alduin in open battle.
No. I live in a nice house in Solitude where the air isn't filled with smoke from the silver smelters and golden-haired girls shine my shield.
Normally I talk to a victim before I end his life, but I wouldn't recommend it this time. Maro will be alert to danger. Talking may spook him.
Oh yes, please, kind sir. My mama and papa left me all alone, and I'm so very hungry. I know a shortcut to the candy shop. Through this alley.
Oh, but you didn't help poor Cicero! You helped that stupid farmer! Stupid Loreius! Oh, the guard said cruel things about us. Untrue things...
One day he simply ran out to me in the field, excited that he'd made some sort of a breakthrough and he was going to head out on another trip.
Right now, the Guild needs someone to maintain order. Everyone is awaiting the news of Mercer's demise; it couldn't be a more precarious time.
Skyrim doesn't take kindly to being told what to do. And to try and forget Talos, well... they may as well ordered us all to cut off our ears.
Someone lied. Someone told the guard poor Cicero did something he did not. We were detained, delayed! The Night Mother kept from her new home!
Take my wedding band. Stuhn only knows why I've kept it this long. He'll recognize it. Tell him whatever you think will convince him to leave.
That doesn't matter. All it would take is a stray wolf or a bandit crossing your path... I can't bare to lose you after everything we've done.
That's the part that Ulfric's supporters always conveniently forget about. Unless the Empire stands together, the Thalmor will destroy us all.
That's the real question, isn't it? The jester enters, seals the door, and the conversation begins. So someone must be waiting for him inside.
The Dominion recognized the heresy of proclaiming Talos a god. Talos was a great man, and a great Emperor... but that does not make him a god.
The Empire will allow Ulfric's forces to enter Hjaalmarch. Idgrod Ravencrone will go into exile, with Sorli the Builder replacing her as Jarl.
The Empire's ravenous hunger for Skyrim's silver makes them fierce. But rest assured, we'll win the Reach and wrest it from their greedy paws.
The gods are watching. The spirits of our ancestors are stirring. And men under suns yet to dawn will be transformed by what we do here today.
The Khajiit hail from a distant land called Elsweyr, bordered on the north by Cyrodiil and the south by the glistening blue waters of the sea.
The men who are looking for me, the Alik'r, they are assassins in the employ of the Aldmeri Dominion. They wish to exchange my blood for gold.
The Nord kings - oh, excuse me, [QUOTE]Jarls[QUOTE] - they can't seem to control their own people. So the Legion has stepped in to keep order.
The Reach is a beautiful but dangerous place, eh? One false step and you'll fall to your death, that is if those Forsworn don't get you first.
There are those who still call themselves Stormcloaks, who continue to fight us, and bring misery to the people... but they are few in number.
There must be a way to activate these doors deeper in the ruins. Here, take this key. It should open the doors on either side of this chamber.
There were several Khajiit camped outside the walls of Whiterun. Seems they've been traveling around the whole of Skyrim peddling their wares.
There you are! Astrid's told me all about you. Heard she pulled the ole' [QUOTE]Choose your victim[QUOTE] gag with you. Ah, I love that one...
There you are. Look, I... I just wanted to say thanks for coming to find me. Back in Dawnstar. Crazy jester finally met his match, am I right?
Therefore, by my authority as Jarl, I pronounce you Thane of Riften and award you all of the benefits befitting your station. Congratulations.
They were said to be quite fond of ritual sacrifices. So fond, in fact, that the high priest spent a great deal of time sharpening the dagger.
Things are bad, Igmund. Our forces are barely able to keep the Forsworn in check. Merchants are reporting the loss of more of their shipments.
This city has a long history of madness and murder. The Wolf Queen... Pelagius... The death of High King Torygg... And now, public executions.
This is an unfortunate but unavoidable ebb in revenue. But as long as we continue to support the Empire, our sacrifices will be well rewarded.
Truthfully? I'm not entirely sure. It's not that I don't have the utmost respect for Sithis, and the Night Mother, and the ancient ways. I do.
Ulfric Stormcloak. Some here in Helgen call you a hero. But a hero doesn't use a power like the Voice to murder his king and usurp his throne.
Vici is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus.
We prefer not to announce that the Sybil has died until we can introduce the new one. People like to know that we're connected to the goddess.
We should be inside, loading up on treasure. Worry-scales here thinks we should wait, though. Don't get any ideas, either. We were here first.
We worship him that we might follow in his path. We can't literally join him in the heavens, but we may do our best to know them here on Nirn.
We'll look around Sky Haven Temple and see what else the old Blades might have left for us. It's a better hideout than I could have hoped for.
Well done, mortal. All things are in their order, and Orchendor roams the Pits. His betrayal will be punished, and your obedience is rewarded.
When Ulfric's lips parted, when he unleashed the power of the Thu'um... That Shout, that ancient and terrible tongue... ripped Torygg asunder.
Why am I not surprised to learn Cicero is alive? I still can't stomach the little clown, but if you've welcomed him here, I won't question it.
With respect, Companion, I'd ask that you and your friends muzzle that dog of yours. The howling coming from Jorrvaskr has gotten out of hand.
Yes, and I'm also aware of how necessary my divinations and wards have been in the city's defense. My experiments are all I ask for in return.
You are the best Septim that's ever ruled. Well, except for that Martin fellow, but he turned into a dragon god, and that's hardly sporting...
You don't know what you're dealing with. There will be consequences if you harm that tree. Leave this place - you're not welcome here anymore.
You infiltrated the position, eliminated the target, and made it look like an accident. Impressive. I'd say you earned your bonus on that one!
You must be the... assassin. I need you to kill the Itinerant Lumberjack, in Morthal, at the logging camp. Here, this is all the gold I have. 
You must find and kill Voltus Agallon. Doing so will disrupt security sufficiently that we will be able to, eventually, get to to the Emperor.
You must realize what a great honor this is. For the Night Mother to have chosen you... I am just in awe. You have Cicero's utmost confidence!
You must speak to that Muiri woman, correct? I have heard rumors in Windhelm. She was recently implicated in a thievery, along with her lover.
You're pretty tough, I respect that. Bringing in a lot of coin for the Guild, making us look good too. Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Your compassion is admirable, but you see, we cannot help them all. The poor must learn from the examples of the gods and raise themselves up.
Ah, but when you're done, there's no use returning here, is there? I was thinking... the Dawnstar Sanctuary. We could make a proper home there.
All those rules, all that discipline, and look where the Dark Brotherhood ended up. We're the last of our kind, and we live the way we see fit.
An unfortunate natural disaster that ravaged the area. The College fared far better than the city of Winterhold, but it was not left untouched.
And now, your reward. A unique spell to summon a legend of the Dark Brotherhood. His soul serves us now in death, as his body once did in life.
And their heretical artifacts grant powers to mortals that wreak havoc across Tamriel. They must be destroyed or guarded to prevent temptation.
Are you the assassin? From the...? Well, there's this Traveling Dignitary, in Solitude. I need her... you know. This gold will cover it, right?
As a matter of fact, no one has dared assassinate an Emperor of Tamriel since the murder of Uriel Septim, and that was two hundred years ago...
Aye. I've worked on a few moorings here and there for it. Most of the ship captains are superstitious about who works on their vessels, though.
Back in 42 I was stationed in Hammerfell, on leave in Sentinel, trying to track down some refugee relatives who had fled persecution in Alinor.
Be that as it may, we have no other choice. You need to remain unseen! Now go! Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.
Because of the current political climate, people are going to assume the murder is related to the bad blood between the Legion and Stormcloaks.
Better if we don't talk about that. As far as anyone's concerned, we all had dinner at a nice inn along the road, and nothing strange happened.
Both Vittoria and her husband will be there for the duration, and everyone in Solitude is invited to attend. You'll have plenty of opportunity.
Brynjolf, something stinks around here and it's more than just the Ratway. We all know it. The question is, what's Mercer going to do about it?
But I am not the Listener. Oh no. There is no Listener. Not yet! But some day, some day, some day I pray, that one will come to hear her say...
But with the death of High King Torygg, the Festival has been declared [QUOTE]in poor taste.[QUOTE] So it looks like it won't happen this year.
First, our intelligence suggests one of the rebel garrisons has become disaffected. If we play our cards right, we should be able to turn them.
For a time he served his purpose, but that time has ended. He uses my gifts for his own amusement, and the only amusement I tolerate is my own.
For we are the children of man! And we shall inherit both heavens and earth! And we, not the Elves or their toadies, will rule Skyrim! Forever!
Good, you're here. Look, in Ivarstead, there's this Beautiful Barbarian. I need her dead. Don't ask why. Just do it. This gold should cover it.
Ha! This is a stroke of good fortune. Long have I watched the Dark Brotherhood's movements... waiting for the time to strike. That time is now!
He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he was trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. Did he really do it?
He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he's trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. I really hope he does.
Here I'll show you on your map so you can stay away. Please, if you can help me let me know or get out of my way so I can try to find a priest.
Hmph. I wouldn't worry too much about this Virane giving you the information you need. Give him a good scare, and he'll squawk like a Hagraven.
Hmph. Now there's an excellent question. An excellent question, indeed. Truth is, as soon as the Emperor sets sail,  I'm resigning my position.
How about the fact that our farm was attacked by bandits, and that they killed my entire family who didn't even brandish a weapon against them.
I am the perfect weapon. My innocent, childish form grants me nearly unrestricted access. Poison or a good bite usually takes care of the rest.
I have watched you for some time, you know. The decisions you've made intrigue me, and I wonder if you are the proper agent for a task of mine.
I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, and is trying to get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. That would be so wonderful.
I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, to try and get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. And... he actually pulled it off!
I like to think I've aged well. I'm certainly wiser than I once was. And I know when one should speak... and when one should hold their tongue.
I realize some of you may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and will not hesitate to end your lives either.
I suppose. But what about the old man? Son killed, family name ruined... and he acts as if nothing even happened. Think he's even fit for duty?
I would be most appreciative if you would permit me to perform some, ah, tests on you. Purely in the interests of the advancement of knowledge.
I'm proud we liberated Falkreath from the Empire. In many ways it's the heart and soul of Skyrim. Not to mention its rather strategic position.
I've tried to explain that Roggvir did something bad and that we all have to be accountable for our actions but... a child feels what she will.
If not for the war, we might have enough guards in the hold to protect the settlements. That the dragons should return now is most unfortunate.
In the year 3E 41, Emperor Pelagius Septim was murdered in the Temple of the One in the Imperial City. Cut down by a Dark Brotherhood assassin.
It is a good path, one untraveled by many. It is a path that can save your College. I will tell you what you need to know to follow it further.
Kyne teaches us to respect the beasts and blesses the hunter who will face their champions. True Nord hunters are those who survive the Trials.
Let me give you a small bit of advice. Nothing in this line of work is easy. If it was, every dreg in the Ratway would be robbing Riften blind.
Let me handle that. You'll have a real invitation, don't worry. As long as you can act the part of a Thalmor toady, you'll get past the guards.
Let the Way of the Voice be your guide, and the path of wisdom will be clear to you. Breath and focus, Dragonborn. Your future lies before you.
Looking to blow yourself up? I hear that's what magic does to you. There's a College in Winterhold that teaches magic, unless that blew up too.
Looks like it's really happening. A peace council, attended by both Ulfric and Tullius, up on High Hrothgar. Maybe there's hope for Skyrim yet.
Me? Oh, Cicero is just the Keeper! I... keep! I look after our matron, you see. The Night Mother. I keep her clean, and protected, and happy...
Not so ridiculous, really. I know people don't think much of her. But she is the Jarl after all.  Plenty of folk would kill to be in her shoes.
Now, down to business. I'm arranging a job for you. But in the meantime, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over.
Oh ho. Now that's the Dark Brotherhood I know and love. This for business or pleasure? Ah, what's it matter, right? I'll see that it gets done.
Oh ya, very good. Very good. My it is dark down here. Oh, but you are so beautiful. Such a lovely smile. Your teeth... your teeth! No! Aggghh!!
Oh, I know you have to, but it makes me sad all the same. I love the Gourmet's recipes. The world will soon be a blander, less flavorful place.
On the ninth of Rain's Hand our prayers went unanswered, yet here we stand, not faltering in our belief that soon you will show yourself to us.
Once his corpse lays cold upon the ground, and all trace of his followers erased, retrieve my Ebony Mail. A gift fit only for my true champion.
One of these poor sods has a contract out on their life. Which one is it? Any idea? Make your choice. Make your kill. And you get to walk away.
Rumor has it the Jarl's Steward, Raerek, is a faithful Talos worshipper, if not a true son of Skyrim - he still supports the Empire, after all.
So how's this work exactly? Do you just kind of stand there on the look out? That's what Bolgeir does. Well, he sort of looms more than stands.
So the Dragon Cult poisoned their own well, which explains the ghosts. However, Skorm thought the well was the key to entering the inner areas.
So walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! A tiny white lie for a dark assassin!
Some believe that Dragonborn are sent into the world by the gods, at times of great need. We will speak more of that later, when you are ready.
Tell you what. Why don't you hold onto Shadowmere a while longer? He's a fine steed, and hasn't been ridden nearly as much as he should lately.
That all happened in the First Era, so the well should be clear of poison by now. It says the key to the well is likely somewhere in the crypt.
That'd be great. There's a case of our soon-to-be famous mead that needs to get to Winterhold. Get it there, and you can keep the delivery fee.
The age of the stones themselves has yet to be officially determined. It has been widely assumed that they were placed during the Merethic Era.
The crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and it is said to contain a portion of the power of  every king who has worn it.
The Mythic Dawn killed Uriel Septim VII and his heirs, triggering the events that lead to the Oblivion Crisis, when the Daedra invaded Tamriel.
The sealed letter will explain everything that needs to be done. The amulet is quite valuable - you can use it to pay for any and all expenses.
Then listen to this - don't kill me. Let poor Cicero live! I attacked the strumpet Astrid, I did! And I'd do it again! Anything for our mother!
There have been reports of weird happenings near Wolfskull Cave. Travelers disappearing, odd lights. I suspect wild animals or perhaps bandits.
These tools were found in a crypt outside Windhelm. They belonged to the ancient Nords who dwelt in Skyrim before the days of the First Empire.
This may have begun as a minor amusement, but it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff.
Today, the problems of Skyrim are not my problems. Nor are they yours. Today we are joined in peace and happiness. So please, enjoy yourselves.
Very little. You have my word on that. The Night Mother represents a chapter in the Dark Brotherhood's history that has long since been closed.
Very well. I'll send a request for additional Legionnaires to protect trade to the other Imperial holds. Hopefully Solitude can spare more men.
Walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell the pretender Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! One little itty bitty lie!
We have it on good authority that Ulfric has raised enough men to attack the city of Whiterun. The Jarl, however, refuses the Legion's support.
We mostly carry herbs and alchemical ingredients, that sort of thing. Before the war, our stock was mostly used for aromatic use in homes, yes.
We're quartered in the Hall of the Vigilant. Keeper Carcette heads Skyrim's branch of our order there, providing healing and justice as needed.
We're ready to launch our attack on Solitude. But the Emperor's cousin is getting married! We can't risk attacking now. So we'll bide our time.
Well... maybe just this once. But there's still a price on your head. Better make yourself scarce, or we'll have to do this little dance again.
What an interesting idea. I think if someone were to do something like that, there would definitely be a certain amount of loot to be shared...
What're you going to do after you graduate? I'm thinking of joining the Legion. I hear they're looking for skalds. Just think. Me - a war bard.
What's more, Ulfric's refusal to execute his slain enemy's wife will be portrayed as the ultimate act of compassion. Hmph. It's genius, really.
When we are done with that, we will take our army to the Dominion, and show those pointy-eared bastards not every man is fit to be their slave.
Why shouldn't I? The Falmer have killed more than a fair share of my acquaintances. They're animals... they show absolutely no pity or remorse.
Yes, yes, you're the new Family member. Let's make this easy - consider me the cranky old uncle nobody talks to. You go your way, I'll go mine.
You know, Dorthe, with all those vegetables I've been growing lately, I was thinkin' we could make a right lovely stew. Together. How about it?
You may be my wife, but this is my business, so just do your job. Don't worry, you'll still have plenty of gold left over to waste on trinkets.
You may have noticed the College, just to the north there. Very prestigious place. Mages from all over Tamriel traveled here to seek knowledge.
You see, right here. Sky Haven Temple, constructed around one of the main Akaviri military camps in the Reach, during their conquest of Skyrim.
You want me to smile? What's there to smile about? Soldiers and dragons are going to be trampling all over the crops this year. I just know it.
You'll have to make your own decision. It's a beautiful philosophy, but outside the seclusion of High Hrothgar, I was never able to hold to it.
You've got to track a man, kill him, and then frame him for a crime. This contract's perfect... for me. Clearly, my lovely wife made a mistake.
Your interests lay where I wish them to lay otherwise my favorite daughter may end up homeless and without a septim to her name. Is that clear?
...[QUOTE]go to the college[QUOTE] da said... [QUOTE]use your smarts[QUOTE] he said... like I'm supposed to figure out which college he meant...
...ho ho ho, and hee hee hee, break that lute across my knee... and if the bard, should choose to fight, why then I'll set his clothes alight...
Ah, but without a doubt, the most compelling feature of this frozen wasteland is the volley of inane questions leveled at me on a regular basis.
Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! You already found it! You are cut from a different cloth than the usual brutes the Jarl foists on me.
Alain used me to get close to my friends. And now they all think I'm some kind of... monster. Alain Dufont took my life. And now I'm taking his.
Alduin's Wall... one of the lost secrets of the Blades. Where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy.
All that will change with his cousin's murder. Everyone will think it was motivated by the conflict between the Imperial Legion and Stormcloaks.
All your drinks are watered down, Kleppr. You aren't fooling me, and you know Lisbet can't afford to pay me enough for the finest drinks anyhow.
And as if that wasn't enough. I got this damn Orc hanging around, getting in the way, yapping about needing help with some kind of vision quest.
And I'll make sure the suspension is lifted. I'm glad we were able to clear this matter up, and I do hope we don't need to have this talk again.
And then there's a tiny problem with a giant that's been raiding our supply caravans... You heard me right. A giant. Need to put a stop to that.
And this inn has the very bed the great general slept in on his first night as Old Hroldan's liberator. As good as it was hundreds of years ago.
As much as I hate to say it, you're almost as powerful as I am right now. But that's just because half of my power resides in that mutt, Barbas.
As to Potema herself, find what's left of her body, likely a skeleton. Remove it from the Catacombs and bring it back to be sanctified by Arkay.
As Whiterun's priest of Arkay, I spread his word whenever I'm able. In the meantime, most of my hours are spent with the city's dearly departed.
Best of all, there's no need to smuggle things quietly anymore. With the influence we have in Solitude, I can march it right out the front door.
But he has returned home, and people have heard strange chanting. They say it's the Black Sacrament, the ritual to contact the Dark Brotherhood.
But I refuse to abandon the shrine. The visions are a gift. Azura warns me of tragedy, war, death before it happens. I won't leave her guidance.
But I've never been much for religion. I kill because it's what I've been trained to do. It's all I know. So long as Astrid is happy, I'm happy.
But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and is doing some kind of dark ritual. He's trying to summon some killers to come get old Grelod.
But she's nothing but a puppet for the Empire now, with her husband Torygg dead. Ulfric will make sure she never takes the throne as High Queen.
But that's the kind of talk an old warhorse shouldn't be making. Don't worry. I have my problems with the Empire, but I'm still a soldier first.
But they are no match for Legionnaires. You are the best and the brightest warriors in Tamriel. Professional soldiers, fearless and devastating.
But would you do me a favor? Tell my mother to suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. She'll know what it means.
But... I can't run the Temple without the support of people who are inspired by the Gildergreen. How can this little tree bring new worshippers?
Don't let Tolfdir fool you; he's the pre-eminent scholar on Alteration. One of the best in Tamriel, and always willing to pass on his knowledge.
Each caravan is obliged to pay dues, but in return a small portion of the profits are shared between them and the leader parcels out the routes.
Ever wonder if maybe we should a call a truce with the Stormcloaks, join forces for just a little while, and take care of some of these dragons?
First off, we hear a group of Imperial legionnaires are coming around to our way of thinking. With a little encouragement they'll join our side.
First, we've learnt the whereabouts of an Imperial cur fetching documents for his master in Solitude. We need to put a muzzle on that, don't we?
He had a way of enthralling people and built up a loyal army of followers. Good men fell under his spell and were forever twisted. Made... evil.
Hmm... Well, assuming this Gourmet is just a cook, it will probably be an easy kill. Just be discreet - alerting others will be the real threat.
I don't know where the Keeper has been these past few months, but I recently received another letter. He's bringing the Night Mother here. Soon.
I don't like mimes, minstrels, thespians, acrobats, jugglers, troubadours or tumblers. Flutists give me a headache. I particularly hate jesters.
I... I'm grateful. It's just this... this isn't at all how I imagined things would play out. There was Alain, but I was considering more, and...
If I hadn't heard it with my own ears I wouldn't have believed it. How could Astrid have done this to us? Strangely, I feel only pity for her...
In honor of your service in battle, I am hereby granting you permission to purchase property in Riften. Talk to my steward if you're interested.
In the southwest reaches of Skyrim, in the Pine Forest, you'll find the entrance to our Sanctuary. It's just beneath the road, hidden from view.
It is cryptic, I know, but Azura's signs are never wrong. I believe the fortress may refer to Winterhold. Ask if they know this elven enchanter.
It is no secret that both the Synod and the College of Whispers have recently made inquiries as to the status of our College here in Winterhold.
It was that power that brought me to the attention of the Thalmor. In the Summerset Isles it is a great honor to be chosen to serve the Thalmor.
It's Bersi. He's getting so angry about the corruption in Riften, he said he's going to walk right up to Maven and give her a piece of his mind.
It's not just healing cuts and bruises, you know. The undead are a very real, very dangerous threat and Restoration magics can keep them at bay.
Judging from how well you handled those shopkeepers, I'd say you've done more than simply prove yourself. We need people like you in our outfit.
Kill me or don't, Listener! The power is yours! But spare poor Cicero, and a friend you will have! Oh, such a friend, until we enter the Void...
Lady Ateia, it is the official position of the college to remain neutral in all political affairs. We cannot risk our history by choosing sides.
Magic is nothing but trouble. If you're set on it, there's that College in Winterhold or Ulfric's court wizard. But don't say I didn't warn you.
More dangerous than you know. Left alone, however, he will awaken when he has grown too powerful to be stopped. This is the only way to be sure.
My plan was to take the horse from our lodge and deliver it to Letrush at the stables. Obviously, that didn't exactly work out as I'd planned...
Next problem - Imperial thieves have, yet again, stolen an important resource.  So we're gonna take it from them permanently - by destroying it.
No, no, this one's alone on the road outside of town. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company.
Now, I must advise you that if your only purpose in being here is to complain, you would be far better off speaking with the Jarl of Winterhold.
Oh, but she taught her son well. Pelagius learned at a very early age that danger could come from anywhere. At any time. Delivered... by anyone.
Oh, no no no! No mistake at all. What you made was a choice. Granted, not a very wise choice, but these things happen. Ah, the folly of youth...
Oh! Well, I hope she doesn't suspect me. I mean, I've spoken with Cicero a bit, and he's quite charming. But I'd never go against Astrid. Never.
Perhaps, but necessary. My cousin, Fura, is somewhere out there in Skyrim right now, fighting Ulfric Stormcloak and his damned insurrectionists.
Place the lexicon into their contraption and focus the knowings into it. When it brims with glow, bring it back and Septimus can read once more.
Please, excuse my ignorance.  Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival. You should proceed to the kitchens straight away.
Poor Giruad Gemane at the Bards College has been waiting for my latest work, [QUOTE]Olaf and the Dragon,[QUOTE] for weeks now. Roads are a mess.
Secondly, some rebel scouts that have seen too much are moving through the hold. Need to take them out before they report back to their leaders.
She died out there, only having tended to the wounded soldiers for a few months. We never even found her body... the Empire burned all the dead.
Shor's bones! Here it is! Alduin's Wall... so well preserved... I've never seen a finer example of early second era Akaviri sculptural relief...
Sidgeir has no interest in running his hold, and so leaves such matters to me. As for my part, I do my best to see that folk are treated fairly.
Since then, his writings have been scattered all over Skyrim, but are little use to anyone who can't translate them. I'm one of the few who can.
Sir, this is costing lives of both imperial loyalists and Skyrim citizens alike. And it's winning the rebels support where they had none before.
Speak with the Desperate Gambler at the Barracks, in Windhelm. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Wary Outlaw at the Bee and Barb, in Riften. Accept his gold, and then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Suppose not. But what's taking the others so long? The sooner we get out of here, the better. Smoke's getting bad. This place'll be raging soon.
Take this blade, a symbol of your new station and responsibility. I'll keep an eye on your progress. The Empire rewards excellence, and so do I.
Thanks to all of these odd principles, there is quite a lot of debate as to whether this is really a dream or just the machinations of Vaermina.
That, my darlings, is why you're here. Why you will always be here, until the day you come of age and get thrown into that wide, horrible world.
That's right. Old inn to the south. The oaf doesn't even bother to visit these days. What am I supposed to do if the dragons burn down the farm?
The city guard has been tearing Riften apart looking for the source of our skooma problem. I'd hate to be in their shoes if they get discovered.
The only way to get that special job is by doin' smaller ones in those cities until we catch their ear... then they'll contact me and we're off.
Then I suggest you [QUOTE]collect[QUOTE] it. Until you pay the fine, you are effectively cut off from all Dark Brotherhood duties and contracts.
They were suffering so from vampirism, and begged me for a cure. Then you came and ended their misery! I couldn't have planned it better myself.
Today, she's... well, she's a skeleton. An ancient corpse. But, more importantly, a corpse that's being brought to this Sanctuary by her Keeper.
Truth is, I found out about all the Imperial spies crawling around Falkreath. A few well-placed bribes, and they bought themselves some friends.
Twice I've been robbed, and good luck getting any kind of justice from Vignar now that he's the Jarl. He probably told the Stormcloaks to do it.
Ulfric is dead and his army destroyed. There's not much more I could ask of you. The gods, however, I suspect, may have plans for you elsewhere.
Ulfric's capital is Windhelm, northeast of here. You'll want to talk to Galmar Stone-Fist, Ulfric's right-hand man. He handles the new recruits.
Unfair! Unjust! Cicero has done nothing wrong! Loreius will pay for his treachery! Oh, how he will pay... And you! You were no help! Not at all!
Using two weapons means you've got no defense. You can't block anything. But if you hit him with both at the same time, he may not get up again.
We just take what will not be missed. What no one needs anymore. Maybe we take some weapons and stop a few deaths. Who would call that thievery?
Well, sounds like you've had quite the journey, Uthgerd. But you were gone longer than usual. I got to thinking maybe you weren't coming back...
Well, would you look at that! Argonian Ale! My thanks, friend. Here, take this here healing potion. I, er, [QUOTE]found[QUOTE] it in the temple.
Working with the Guild again is the best decision I've ever made. Protection, respect and a constant flow of coin... it couldn't get any better.
Years ago, this temple was raided by an orc war party seeking revenge... they were being plagued by nightmares just like the people of Dawnstar.
Yes, exactly. Well, I think so. It's certainly our best hope. The ancient Blades remembered much Akaviri dragonlore that has now been forgotten.
Yes, I know. We have some advantages if they come here. The city is built into the mountainside, so it's hard to reach into even from the skies.
You keep it. I'd sooner finally put this chapter of my life behind me. Congratulations. You've changed the fate of a Daedric artifact and lived.
You know, I was there for that whole sordid affair. Marvelous time! Butterflies, blood, a Fox, a severed head... Oh, and the cheese! To die for.
You might run into some of them lizard-folk in Riften. Quite a few of them work the docks there, not sure why. Like swimming in the lake, maybe.
You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now you're here, as if the very stars have finally aligned.
You think you know pain? Do you!? Try watching your wife and daughter burn alive after they've been ravaged by brigands! That's pain, my friend.
You'll also need to align the mirrors using the controls up above. Once everything is lined up, the light will reflect back through the crystal.
You're a Nord! I never would have guessed it! But where in the world did you learn to cook like that? Here in Skyrim? Or maybe somewhere less...
You're being sent to meet with the contact directly, is that correct? What a most unusual occurrence. Astrid usually performs this duty herself.
Your destiny is dark. Oh yes, so dark. But much of it has been fulfilled. You have found sanctuary, and the comforting words of a mother's love.
Ah, but there has not been a Listener in years and years. Our Lady has not chosen Cicero, and certainly not Astrid. Or... anyone. But some day...
Ah, good. Looks like the reinforcements for the fort are on the way. And we have some information about enemy troop movements as well. Excellent.
And of course the symbol for [QUOTE]Dragonborn.[QUOTE] That's the one that appears to have a sort of arrow shape pointing downward at the bottom.
At least, that's what we thought until I translated some ancient texts a year or so ago. We now believe King Olaf buried the truth with the bard.
Because it was dull. Every day was the same boring routine; working at the winery, social visits with friends, parties with no one I cared about.
Been lots of people coming and going through that creepy black door. And noises...  I'd say it sounds like construction, but that's crazy. Right?
Before you can enchant your weapon or armor, you'll need to learn an enchantment by sacrificing an enchanted item. Just use the arcane enchanter.
But first you'll need to learn who he is. Assuming, of course, that the Gourmet actually is a [QUOTE]he.[QUOTE] Could be a woman for all we know.
But I also want you to find our hidden camp in Falkreath. Galmar will have special tasks for you, and will need you when we liberate the capital.
But it's one thing to take pride in your lineage, and another to cling blindly to the past. What they call honor and tradition, I call ignorance.
But really, since Torygg's death, Falk Firebeard wields the true power of the Jarl's court. My brother is nothing more than a pompous little fop.
But unfortunately, that inn is abuzz with the news of somebody killing one of their guests! What, hiding the body was too much for you to handle?
But you must be anxious to get to work. I'm arranging a job, but need a bit more time. For now, go see Nazir. He's got several smaller contracts.
By Sithis, you slew everyone! Well, except for that one you kept alive, to serve as witness. Does your wickedness, or your skill, know no bounds?
Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches. They built the temple.
Do you mistrust poor Cicero? I am, as you say, just an innocent jester. A fool! Oh, but my work is not foolish, no. For I am our mother's Keeper.
Draft another letter with the usual platitudes, but this time share some of your intelligence regarding Ulfric's plans. Embellish if you have to.
Empire's in charge now, huh? Only a matter of time before we start getting bothered by them Thalmoricars... err, Justimors... Y'know, them elves.
Even still, I make a point of announcing myself when I enter her room now. I spooked her so bad last time she almost threw the chamber pot at me!
Festus has been spearheading this part of the assassination plan. He's close to uncovering the identity of the Gourmet. You should report to him.
Gallus once said he felt comfortable around me; able to let his guard down. I can't help but think that I'm responsible for what happened to him.
Good. This is Skyrim, and we should honor the old ways. These foreigners don't even respect their own gods, much less Kyne and her Sacred Trials.
Hmph. You know, you've got a certain... fire in your eyes. Just like my Beirand. Please, feel free to look around. We've got a bit of everything.
Hold on, there. I suppose, in the uh, interest of research... I can spare a few more coins. Double and a half its value. That's all I can muster.
I almost can't believe it's over. The rebellion is squashed, Windhelm is free. I must admit, Ulfric put up a stronger fight than I was expecting.
I feel only pity for Cicero. He must die, of course, but can any of us truly blame him for his actions? We mocked him, disrespected the Old Ways.
I feel that it's time to put aside the grievances of the past, and let peace and prosperity flourish between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion.
I fight for my people impoverished to pay the debts of an Empire too weak to rule them, yet brands them criminals for wanting to rule themselves!
I guess I got tired of handing out contracts to everyone else, while I stayed home playing den mother. It was good to get out, and have some fun.
I just wanted things... to stay the way they were. Before Cicero, before the Night Mother. Before... you. I thought I could save us. I was wrong.
I personally trained a whole litter for the Jarl. That reminds me, I was going to deliver some dog food to the Keep. Spiced beef. Their favorite.
I planned to kill Alain myself, you know. Nilsine, too. But lost my nerve. I even brewed a special poison, Lotus Extract. Maybe you could use it?
I simply locked the doors, hid beneath my counter and prayed to the Divines that my life would be spared and my shop wouldn't burn to the ground.
I told you, it's the wedding of Vittoria Vici, an extremely well connected merchant with the East Empire Company. The Emperor's cousin? Remember?
I'm not going to go through the normal process with you. I've got a little test lined up. Pass that, and we'll talk about you joining the Legion.
I'm sorry. So very sorry. The Penitus Oculatus... Maro... He said that by giving you to them, he would leave the Dark Brotherhood alone. Forever.
I've been instructed to tell all visitors that the Lady Elisif isn't feeling well. She wishes you a good day, and please call again another time.
I've taken the liberty of visiting the cities, and spreading some nasty rumors about Gaius Maro. To make his treachery that much more believable.
Idiot. I may not have a lot of rules, but that doesn't give you free reign to do as you please. You want to resume your duties? Go talk to Nazir.
If we lose half our men, the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves' Guild will have the run of the city. The Stormcloaks will be the least of our worries!
If you ever think of throwing meat at me, I will have you dragged off to Cidhna Mine so fast the guards will yank those filthy arms of yours off.
If you're serious, you're in the right place. Our headquarters is Castle Dour. Here you'll find General Tullius, commanding our forces in Skyrim.
It fills me with joy to hear you're with child, Dinya. They said it wouldn't... that it couldn't happen, but Mara has shown them they're mistake.
It was our honeymoon. Tepid, I said! The bathwater should be tepid! Lukewarm is not tepid! Close, maybe, but there's is a difference! Stupid cow.
It's good we hold the Reach. Were the rebels to gain control, the silver mines would give them coin to hire more thugs and expand their violence.
Its location was lost for centuries, but I know where it is: Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden within the crags of the Reach.
J'zargo... what shall we have you do... Ah! Why don't you verify that we're the first ones here? Look for any amount of tampering with the tombs.
Just remember Astrid's commitment to her Sanctuary, to her Family. A Family that now counts you as one of its own. Honor Astrid above all others.
Kill every single member of his band. Do so as silently and invisibly as you can, for this is not about you. You are to be my instrument in this.
Look how you sniffed out my little scheme at the North Gate. You knew it was a shakedown and you called him on it. That's what I'm talking about.
Make sure those forged documents get to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar. It'll throw him off our trail, allowing us to maneuver more freely.
Many of you will be staying in Windhelm to aid the Jarl in restoring order and stamping out any embers of rebellion that may still smolder here. 
No. I trust you'll do more good out there in the world, wherever you damn well please to go. You're a true son of Skyrim. You'll know what to do.
Now, I don't want to alarm you, but there are bandits in these parts. We're safe up here, of course. Just be careful if you're ever here on foot.
Now, I know what you're thinking. Can I still rely on my swords and spells and sneaking and all that nonsense? Sure, sure. Or... you could use...
Oh my, yes. I absolutely love weddings. I haven't found my special someone yet, but there's still hope. Vittoria is, well, getting up in years...
Oh yes, it is Cicero! You were a fool to spare me. What, did you think I would be grateful? Cicero should be Listener! Not you! Now you will die!
Oh, well, it's just... I never imagined the Gourmet was a Khajiit. You know, because of all the fur, and the potential for getting hair in the...
On behalf of the sons and daughters of Skyrim, on behalf of all that is righteous and true, take this token of our appreciation for your service.
Oohhh... Cicero's heard about the Butcher. Interesting knifework. Just... Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab! And then... Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab!
Riften is drowning in a sea of sin and wickedness and it's my personal mission to let everyone know that the warmth of Mara can see them through.
Skyrim is now host to giant, flying lizards and two-legged cat-men... and you're surprised by me? Yes. I just talked. And am continuing to do so.
Skyrim's days are darkening, and the Legion will soon be called into service like never before. But we stand ready, as always, to meet that call.
So you're the Listener, hmm? Well that hardly seems fair. You just got here. The Night Mother should have spoken to me. Any idiot could see that.
Some brothers have taken to calling you Bone-Breaker, evidence of your ferocity and determination. A fitting name. So we shall all call you thus.
Some see only blank pages, and nobody knows why. Perhaps some of us are born with no destiny, or maybe the blank pages signify an imminent death.
Soon enough we will march on Solitude. And on that day the heroes of Sovngarde will march with us, and the Empire will fall to its knees in fear.
Soon. I'm not exactly sure when. But not to worry - the ceremony itself is being followed up by a public banquet that will last for several days.
Take an enchanted weapon or piece of armor, then use the Arcane Enchanter to learn its secrets. The item is destroyed in the process, so be wary.
That's the spirit. By swearing this oath you become one of us. A heroine of the people. A true daughter of Skyrim. A Stormcloak. Repeat after me.
The Emperor is still in Skyrim, but not for long. He's onboard his ship, the Katariah, moored offshore in the Solitude Inlet. But you must hurry!
The honor has been mine. You should be proud of what we've accomplished here. The Dark Brotherhood is no more. And the Emperor, finally, is safe.
The Lord of Plots, Deceiver of Nations, Devourer of Trinimac. The Queen of Shadows, Goddess of Destruction, He-Who-Destroys and She-Who-Erases...
The very idea is inconceivable to our Elven overlords! Sharing the heavens with us? With man? Ha! They can barely tolerate our presence on earth!
The wood elf may run a stall in the city, but he retreats to the plains outside Whiterun to hunt. Kill him there, and no one will bear witness...
There was a fight down in the Ratway, but reports are... sketchy. Some say it was Thalmor Agents, others say Thieves Guild. Some say it was both.
There's a cave. No, not a cave. A... home? A place you feel secure. You will find safety there... sanctuary. I see snow, lit by the star of dawn.
These days, it seems there is dread everywhere, whether it be war or dragon. But I beg you - here, today, put such fears aside. Enjoy yourselves!
They aren't my [QUOTE]people.[QUOTE] I'm with the Empire because they pay me. And that means I'm out here, and you're in there. So shut up, scum!
They live below the streets in the Ratway like dirty animals. And trust me, they're no better than the vermin that slink out of there for scraps.
This city is corrupt. Rotten to the core. No one cares about anything except themselves and how much coin they can make off the misery of others.
This is a public kill. How you do it is entirely up to you. Arrow to the throat? Knife in the belly? Your choice, so long as it's loud and messy.
Those true sons and daughters of Skyrim will never cease to worship mighty Talos. If we cannot do so in our temples, we will do so in our hearts.
Today, they take away your faith. But what of tomorrow? What then? Do the elves take your homes? Your businesses? Your children? Your very lives?
Tullius has camps in the Pale, entertaining thoughts of battle. The Empire still underestimates the force of our cause. It will be their undoing.
We need to stem the flow of silver to the rebellion. Until we retake the Reach, the Stormcloaks will plunder it's mines to fund further violence.
We stashed what we couldn't carry, and I hid it with a trick I know. I can point you in the right direction, and we'll each go our separate ways.
Well... While it's true I prefer sorcery's more destructive nuances, we mustn't forget the many spells with simpler, more practical applications.
Were the Stormcloaks to prevail in dismantling Imperial rule in Skyrim, who would be her protector? No. We will crush this rebellion. We must do.
When I was thirteen I accidentally burned down the family home. A bit of lightning gone awry. Ah, but soon after I mastered my gifts. Completely.
You know, you remind me of myself at a young age. All I cared about was riding narwhales and sleeping in honeycombs and drinking babies' tears...
You said they were sleeping. I said they were waiting. It seems a few of them were [QUOTE]waiting[QUOTE] for someone to try and take the Lexicon.
You will need stealth and lies to get past her guards. You will assassinate her swiftly and quietly. And if combat finds you, survive the escape.
You! You're responsible for the siege of Solitude! By Sithis, this undermines all our plans! Fool! Finish that mess, and only then will we speak!
Ages past, Sithis gave a woman five children. She killed them to win his favor, thus becoming the Night Mother. If you believe that sort of thing.
Ah, and let me guess. He wants his horse. Well, that's going to be a bit of a problem. You see, I don't really outright [QUOTE]own[QUOTE] Frost...
Ah, hello my good friend. Would you do me a kindness? I seem to be down to my last drop of spirits. Let me tell you, sobriety is highly overrated.
And to prove my... sincerity, I have prayed for a contract. You lead this Family now. I give you the Blade of Woe, so that you can see it through.
And... I heard about Nilsine. You have more than fulfilled your part of the bargain. Please, take this - as payment, and a symbol of my affection.
As I was saying... You'll need to kill the Gourmet, of course. But what's more, you'll need to get his Writ of Passage, so you can take his place.
At long last! Alduin's doom is now ours to seal - just speak the word and with high hearts we'll hasten forth to smite the worm wherever he lurks.
But it was Ulfric. And he did kill the High King, in honorable combat. My brother refused to allow the the Imperials to take revenge for the deed.
But, there is another option. Some members of the Thieves Guild in Riften can get their bounties... erased. For a price. Something to think about.
By Sithis, I was such a fool. All of this... it's all my fault. You are the best of us, and I nearly killed you... as I've killed everyone else...
By the gods. The Emperor's been murdered. On his own ship... moored in the inlet. It was... the Dark Brotherhood. There was nothing we could do...
Correct. It's a private place where I can catalog my research. Occasionally, the Jarl will come in and have questions, but that's thankfully rare.
Dark Brotherhood? You look the type. Listen, there's this Grim Shieldmaiden walking the streets of Markarth. Kill her. Now take this gold, and go.
Does death not come to us all? Is it not a certainty? I am, therefore, honored to be doom's herald. To play some part in a being's inevitable end.
Don't you see? I was like a daughter to Tova. A sister to Nilsine and Friga. But the family refuses to believe my innocence. No matter what I say.
Don't you see? It was me. I set you up, wanted you dead. I betrayed you, the Night Mother... everything I hold dear. And now Maro has betrayed me.
Folk been hearing some strange stuff coming from the Aretino place. Chanting. Talk is, little Aventus is trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood...
Have you heard about Aventus Aretino? He's a little boy, lives in Windhelm. They say he's been trying to get in touch with the Dark Brotherhood...
He expects us to drop our defenses and greet them with open arms... to dialogue with them rather than defend our homeland by spilling their blood.
Here's all you need to know: I'm a werewolf. I like killing things. I love Astrid. I hate annoying people. And the color blue gives me a headache.
I fear losing Falkreath may give too much advantage to Ulfric. The rebels now control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. I want it back.
I have every right to be at this negotiation. I need to ensure that nothing is agreed to here that violates the terms of the White-Gold Concordat.
I mean, really. Here you stand, before Sheogorath himself, Daedric Prince of Madness, and all you deem fit to do is... deliver a message? How sad.
I paid Sibbi half the cost of Frost up front, but before he could deliver, Maven had him locked up. Sibbi believes this exempts him from our deal.
I should be the one thanking you. You've solved more problems in the short time you've been here then anyone in my court has their entire careers.
I was a student at the Bards College for a short time... until my affiliation with Vaermina was discovered. I haven't been back to Solitude since.
I will never accept his death! My son still lives. I feel it in my heart. So tell me, Battle-Borns, where is he? Where are you holding my Thorald?
I've seen a puzzle like this before... there's got to be another lever to pull, but you'd better hurry. A septim says this mechanism's on a timer.
In honor of your service in battle, I am hereby granting you permission to purchase property in Markarth. Talk to my steward if you're interested.
In honor of your service in battle, I am hereby granting you permission to purchase property in Whiterun. Talk to my steward if you're interested.
In honor of your service in battle, I am hereby granting you permission to purchase property in Windhelm. Talk to my steward if you're interested.
In this courtyard, there are no Stormcloaks. There are no Imperials. There are only people, come to celebrate a union of two souls. So make merry!
In truth, I'm no more a little girl than you are. I was once, of course. Three hundred years ago. Vampirism tends to keep one remarkably... fresh.
Is this about that raid last week? I told Holgrim there was no honor in killing sleeping men, but he wouldn't listen! It wasn't my fault, I swear!
It is from her love of us that we first learned to love one another. It is from this love that we learn that a life lived alone is no life at all.
It was established by Commander Maro when he first arrived in Skyrim, several months ago. When he began preparing for the Emperor's initial visit.
It's just... Well... you're an Orc! Ha ha ha! If the people of the Empire only knew! I mean, now I understand your need for secrecy. Most would...
It's true the Vignar Gray-Mane and his lot are one of Whiterun's oldest and, depending on who you ask, most respected clans. I don't dispute that.
It's true, I'm afraid. Cicero was a little whirlwind, slashing this way and that. It would have been funny, if he weren't trying to murder us all.
It's true, the scrolls are a subject of interest to us, and work has been done to learn of them. But outsiders are not allowed within the College.
Karliah, I'll deal with you after I rid myself of your irksome companions. In the meantime, perhaps you and Brynjolf should get better acquainted.
Look, just don't say anything to Maven, will you? I've spent weeks trying to get that right and if she sees how stupid I am, she'll get rid of me.
Many years ago I lost my blade, [QUOTE]Grimsever,[QUOTE] within a Dwemer ruin. I took it as a sign that I was wasting my days in search of wealth.
More work? My friend, you still haven't finished the last set of contracts I gave you. Why don't you concentrate on eliminating that final target.
Names mean nothing to our Lord. She only cares for those who care for themselves, whose hearts are full of purpose, whose lives are full of deeds.
No way to know if anyone else made it out alive. But this place is going to be swarming with Imperials soon enough. We'd better clear out of here.
No, I'm not having a good time. My boy just married a gods-forsaken Imperial. Skyrim is full of eager Nord women, and he beds down with the enemy.
No. Knowing they could never defeat the orcs, the priests of Vaermina released what they call [QUOTE]The Miasma,[QUOTE] putting everyone to sleep.
Not everyone has the stomach required to entreat my Lord. But Kesh likes you, friend. There is a way Peryite may speak to us who will take Him in.
Not that I'd know anything about it, of course, but it seems to me that the last thing a thieves' guild would want is to draw attention to itself.
Now surely even you know about Pelagius' decree? On his deathbed - oh, and this was inspired - he forbade... death! That's right! Death! Outlawed!
Odahviing will come to your challenge. Boziik. Krilot. He will not be able to resist your call, from the Hill of the Dovah itself... he will come.
Of course our Lady is dead, so she doesn't talk with words, since her lips are... rotted. But inside the Listener's head. I hear it's... intimate.
Oh, and I wasn't entirely truthful before. This is actually going to hurt a lot. You see, you have to be dead in order for the spell to take hold.
Oh, but... I'm sure he'll repay you when he comes to his senses! His favor is a powerful, powerful thing. And so very worth any... inconveniences.
Okay, let's all take a deep breath. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Please tell me this is some kind of sick joke.
Perhaps from Sovngarde, the heroes of old can join me in their rescue. The Harrowing of the Hunting Grounds. It would be a battle of such triumph.
Remember, the Markarth Keep. That's where you'll find Anton Virane. Probably cooking up all of the Gourmet's recipes, passing them off as his own.
Sadly, yes. Even the townsfolk have taken to calling her [QUOTE]Grelod the Kind.[QUOTE] Her very existence has become something of a running joke.
Skyrim was not J'zargo's first choice, but Winterhold is removed from politics, dedicated to study. This is the place for J'zargo to become great.
So far. I just hope things remain calm. Wine gets drunk, tempers flare. This may be a joyous celebration, but it's shadowed by a lot of animosity.
So you're the one from the... Dark Brotherhood? I need you to kill the Big Laborer at Katla's Farm. Here's the gold for the kill. Make it painful.
Some say I got my position because my cousin is the Emperor. Nonsense. The man's given me nothing. He can't even be bothered to attend my wedding.
Thanks to your efforts, Mercer's treachery has been exposed. After we deal with him, all that remains is restoring the Guild to its full strength.
That man was, by far, the most insufferable decoy the Emperor has ever employed. I'm glad he's dead. Ah, but I'm even happier that you killed him.
The best. Vittoria's a good woman. Any man should be so lucky. I know my father's not happy about me marrying an Imperial, but that's his problem.
The blade will feed on the ire of Tamriel. Bathe in your infamy. Feel the weight of their loathing, and my power will course through it once more.
The Gildergreen, yes. It's a bit of an eyesore at the moment. More of a problem for the pilgrims than for me, but not many of them around anymore.
The jobs Astrid gives you will be more important, and usually more complex. Just keep your wits about you. And for Sithis' sake, don't get killed.
The only thing I remember is the old story of Tiber Septim being called Dragonborn by the Nords, before they switched sides and joined the Empire.
The others... I've spoken to them. And they're coming around, I know it. The wizard, Festus Krex... perhaps even the Argonian, and the un-child...
The Trinity disbanded twenty-five years ago when Mercer Frey betrayed us by slaying Gallus and dumping his body in the ruins of Snow Veil Sanctum.
The war demands so much from us, and we give all we have to it and to the people... but I've kept a little something to offer you in appreciation.
Their arrival is the best thing that's happened to this Sanctuary in years. Astrid is an effective leader, but we've been rudderless for too long.
Then it came again, this time more distinct. Closer. Definitely not lightning now. It was orange - brilliant orange, the color of hearth and dawn.
There are all sorts of people wandering around carryin' their valuables on their person... just waitin' for someone like you to pick their pocket.
There's a group of cutthroats out there right now that Ulfric doesn't lift a finger to bring to justice, as long as they don't threaten Nord land.
They are the governing council of the Aldmeri Dominion. They lead us to attack the Empire and forced the Empire to agree to stop worshiping Talos.
This is an amulet of the Emperor's Elder Council. Specially crafted for each member. Worth a small fortune. Ain't somethin' you'd give up lightly.
Ulfric and his thugs are stirring up trouble for their own agenda. The Empire is the only thing keeping the Dominion from walking all over Skyrim.
Ulfric did right killing him. Soon we'll rid Skyrim of elves, their bloody Justiciars, and the Jarls in their pockets. The whole damn lot of them.
Viarmo is trying to get Elisif to allow the Burning of King Olaf. I don't want to look like I don't know how to drink in front of the other bards.
We are but maggots, writhing in the filth of our own corruption! While you have ascended from the dung of mortality, and now walk among the stars!
We'll begin as soon as you're wearing the hat. Check the shelf over there. Wouldn't want the Emperor mistaking you for someone else, now would we.
Well, I don't mean to seem disappointed, but... I just never figured the Gourmet was an Imperial. I had dreamed of something more exotic, maybe...
Well, look at this. Another city rat crawled outside the walls. I don't suppose you've come up here to tell old Froki about your supposed Divines?
Well, this is Falkreath. Not much to look at if you're used to the bigger cities, but the folk here are friendly enough if you give them a chance.
Whose side are you on, Reburrus? I'm not worried about Skyrim, I'm worried about the Reach. Specifically, the part of the Reach we're standing on.
Why don't you head into town and get a drink at the Frozen Hearth? I hear old Nelacar still has a room there. He knows a lot of stories, that one.
Will she put aside her personal hatred for me, and her misplaced love for the Emperor and his coin, so that the suffering of our people will end? 
With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, his security service, the Penitus Oculatus, will need to begin its preparations immediately.
With the threat gone Pelagius is under the delusion that he is safe, which means you've helped him... sort of. And we're that much closer to home.
Working the soil with your hands, seeing your seeds take root and grow, tending a herd... there is a joy in honest labor you won't find elsewhere.
You could be the one I seek... if your will is strong, lure a thrall to my shrine. Convince him to embrace the Pillar of Sacrifice. Then slay him.
You must go to the city of Markarth, and speak with the apothecary's assistant. You'll probably find her in The Hag's Cure, when the shop is open.
You worry too much. The Emperor's never been safer. You think assassination attempts are planned overnight? We discovered the plot. End of threat.
You're the assassin, right? Look, there's this Reckless Mage in the Frozen Hearth Inn, in Winterhold. I want him dead. This gold should cover it. 
A little boy, Aventus Aretino, got sent to the orphanage. Now there's talk he's trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. No good can come of that...
Alain made all the pain just... go away. But it was all lies! Alain used me. He ruined my name, destroyed my friendship with the Shatter-Shields...
Amusing. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to continue my research. I have no time for idle chatter with any simpleton who strikes up a conversation.
And there is still much of Skyrim I wish to see. I hear there is a city, Wind-Helm, that is nearly white with... What do you call it? Ah yes! Snow.
And what do Legion soldiers know about the hills the Reach? And the caves that make up those hills? The Forsworn can hide and ambush every assault.
And, soldier. You better help win me back Markarth, or die trying. It was your brilliant strategy to give it over to the rebels in the first place.
Are you sure? It's rightfully yours, but this money could go to getting better weapons and armor, and making repairs to the settlements we control.
Azura is no ordinary Daedra. She commands an entire realm inside of Oblivion. The more Malyn worked on the Star, the more she was able to damn him.
Before I came into Zenithar's calling, I confess I was a thief. But I learned a few things in my time that might help you survive. Let me show you.
Brynjolf, huh? Lemme guess. He plucked you off the street and dropped you into the thick of things without tellin' you which way is up. Am I right?
But the cookbook only says so much, and everyone makes the Potage differently. I would be honored if we could make it... the Gourmet's special way.
But, I will serve gladly, as that's my lot in life. Now let's see. Ah yes, Volunruud. It's an old crypt, infested with Draugr. So plan accordingly.
Controlling the Pale gives Ulfric a port town and takes the pressure off of Windhelm. But it's only a matter of time before it's back in our hands.
Do this and I shall remember you and bestow an important task upon you. Do this not, and I shall forget you, and your soul will waste in obscurity.
Don't take any chances with this one. Use the Jarrin Root to poison the Emperor's food. You're disguising yourself as a chef - it only makes sense.
Ever get the impression Rikke's not always sure what side she's on? I'm not doubting her loyalty. Just, she seems rather sympathetic to the rebels.
Fine. I did notice something odd last time we handed out the pay. Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room after he got it.
Grelod runs this orphanage because she's old, and set in her ways, and doesn't know any other life. These children need love, and comfort. I try...
Ha! Oh, that's a good one, friend. Killing Lurbuk... I mean, can you even imagine something so ludicrous? Depriving the world of my unique talents?
Haelga is a devout follower of Dibella and dotes over the statue to the Divine that she keeps at the Bunkhouse. Use it as leverage and she'll cave.
Have you ever seen what a bear does to the trees? They jump up on their hind legs and scratch them to bits... marking their territory or something.
He has travelled to Sovngarde to regain his strength, devouring the sillesejoor... the souls of the mortal dead. A privilege he jealously guards...
He is a great man, but one rarely praised! He rules twin empires that span the length and breadth of our minds! All know him, but few can name him!
Hey! You're the one who killed Alain Dufont, up in Raldbthar. Oh yeah, word about that got around. Man was a piece of bandit trash, is what I hear.
Honestly, the Legion can use all the able bodies it can muster. We have our hands full. A dead king, a rebellion, and now dragons? Skyrim's a mess.
I am busy keeping this family in coin and your pretty little head adorned with jewels, so I'll thank you not to question where I go at night, wife.
I began praying to Zenithar, the god of wealth, to bring us some fortune, but thieves made off with my sacred amulet almost as soon as I bought it.
I believe I am, yes. Technically speaking, of course. The city is also home to a priest, priestess, an alchemist, and I'm sure others who practice.
I bet she would feel safer. And hopefully you wouldn't have to baby sit her for long. Once she calms down, she might start thinking straight again.
I don't understand... did you say Ulfric Stormcloak? Fine fellow, although a bit too fond of... I mean, no, of course, I condemn him in the most...
I guessed right! I... I always imagined the great Gourmet was a Wood Elf. You see, only someone with a knowledge of woodland herbs could combine...
I have... fallen from their strict teaching, but I still don't feel it should be used lightly. Not all of Arngeir's lecturing was wasted, it seems.
I know you and father Rorlund have many duties to attend to in the temple, but sometimes I feel that there are more important matters to attend to.
I know you thought we weren't losing much when you gave it to the enemy. But I'm wasting troops guarding the border that belong on the front lines.
I signed on 'cause I couldn't watch the Stormcloaks tearing everything apart and not do something. But, most of my family disagrees with my choice.
I'll let you in if you agree to something for me. There's a giant spider in Nchuand-Zel. My workers call her [QUOTE]Nimhe,[QUOTE] the poisoned one.
I'm glad you're here. I need you to kill a Coldhearted Gravedigger, tends to work in the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm. This is all the gold I have.
I'm saying you were right. The Night Mother was right. The old ways... they guided the Dark Brotherhood for centuries. I was a fool to oppose them.
If it's any comfort, I do feel slightly bad about Veezara. Stupid lizard got in my way! But please tell me that hulking sheepdog has bled to death.
If the Night Mother truly spoke to you, if you really are the Listener... your destiny was written in the Void. Astrid is right to fear your power.
If while you're out there, you stumble into any Stormcloak military camps, I expect you to destroy them. I've reports they are hiding in the hills.
If you are, then you make your way to Windhelm and talk to the man himself. If you're not, well friend, you'd best walk away before this gets ugly.
In life, Hevnoraak drained his own blood from his body. His goal was to transfer his power back into himself after death, becoming a powerful lich.
It hardly matters though. The door to the stairs is securely locked. There's no way anyone without the key can get in. So don't you worry about it.
It means I can't read it to the court. Without the verse I won't be able to convince Elisif of the importance of The Burning of King Olaf Festival.
It's a rare plant, found only on the island of Stros M'Kai. It can be served like any vegetable - cut up, put in a salad, perhaps boiled in a stew.
It's no fair. I love weddings. Astrid should have given this contract to me. Instead, she's got me visiting cities, assessing security. How boring.
It's true, the location of the crown was lost with King Borgas. After the Great Hunt killed him, while he was off on his damned Alessian campaigns.
Looks like Cicero's not the only only one to go a little crazy from time to time. Eh, Listener? You should talk to Nazir, work this whole mess out.
My Da locked me in there in a drunken rage when he left us... three days in there eating the offerings left for our dead before Aunt Agna found me.
My dear Bryling. Barring any... fancy and folly... the good people of Haafingar are surely capable of dealing with the odd highwayman or stray dog.
Now, he's not exactly goin' to welcome you with open arms, but keep your cool. Do this job right and we've just made an important friend out there.
Of course. And you've repaid your debt, in full.  Here's the key to the shack. But why stop here? I say we take our relationship to the next level.
Oh, I think you'll find that magic is rare in Skyrim. Winterhold, though... The College there has it in abundance. Look there if you wish to learn.
Oh, now that explains quite a bit. Motierre, you naughty, naughty boy. Hiring the Dark Brotherhood to help you rise beyond your station. Delicious.
Oh. No, no, no. Don't you understand? Guilt, innocence, right, wrong.... Irrelevant. What matters is I ordered you to kill someone, and you obeyed.
Please, lady. You got to get me out of here. Ever since Aventus left, Grelod's been even meaner than usual. I swear, she's going to kill one of us.
Scrounging for contracts, abandoning the Tenets. The Dark Brotherhood has been reduced to a group of common cutthroats. Frankly, it's embarrassing.
Secondly, I want to take the fort here. Having a fortified position will make it easier for us to amass men for our ultimate attack on the capital.
Security is being handled by a man named Voltus Agallon. His job is to travel throughout Skyrim, and ensure each city is prepared for Mede's visit.
Supposedly, his body was brought back to Skyrim and secretly buried with the crown. Knowledge of that location was lost, in the Wars of Succession.
Sure, you poison the Emperor, but what then? Why not summon an Atronach to cause some chaos? Or turn invisible and slip away. Use your imagination!
Take this symbol of Mara. She will guide you to the wandering souls of two whose love was so great that their entwinement binds them to this world.
Terrible and powerful Talos! We, your unworthy servants, give praise! For only through your grace and benevolence may we truly reach enlightenment!
Thanks for dealing with that orc. Something tells me that's not the last time we'll see him. And, something tells me that might not be a bad thing.
That said, Stormcloak true believers are still operating out of hidden military camps in the hills. If you encounter any on you travels, kill them.
The bards give out spiced wine during the festival, so they put in a big order. And then, for weeks after, demand is so high, I can barely keep up.
The College is always searching for more of Shalidor's writings in an attempt to understand both our knowledge of the man, and of magic in general.
The Imperial City's so far from here, it might as well be on one of the moons. And yet the Empire thinks it can tell us what to do an' how to live.
The man you need to speak with, his name is Motierre? That's a very old and powerful Breton family, firmly established in Cyrodiil. Most curious...
The sap is precious. It can restore barren fields or bring life to rocks. I can use it to repair the Gildergreen, so we can worship properly again.
The Sepulcher isn't merely a temple or a vault to house the Key. Within these walls is the Ebonmere... a conduit to Nocturnal's realm of Evergloam.
The sound of our fury is a storm about to break on the heads of our enemies. Our friendship, a cloak of true brotherhood for all who would wear it.
The Stormcloaks are far from the only threat to the hold. The roads are beset by bandits and beasts... and now there's even talk of bloody dragons.
This is the true Emperor, not some half-Septim lookalike. He'll be surrounded by elite bodyguards, I'm sure. You'll have your work cut out for you.
Thought did cross my mind, yeah. War brewing, talk of a riot in Helgen, and now jesters? Skyrim's gone mad, girl. You need to be careful out there.
True sons and daughters of Skyrim reign in every city, we've crippled the Imperial Legion, and cut off its head by killing General Tullius himself.
Vignar the Revered is the Jarl in Whiterun. I guess he was a great hero once, because the Companions all call him [QUOTE]Vignar the Revered.[QUOTE]
We know there's an actual written travel schedule, somewhere in the Penitus Oculatus outpost. Securing that would, obviously, be most beneficial...
We need the Empire, as much as it needs us. We Nords are the Empire! Our blood built it. Our blood sustains it! You of all people should know that.
We offer this soul to The Revenant: he who watches over the opponents of Arkay and his power over life and death. Fie upon Arkay and his followers!
We're mounting our final attack on Solitude. Get over there and join the rest of the army. They'll be launching the attack soon. Talos be with you!
Well. You must have all those annoying gods on your side to have made it this far, whoever you are. Even I have to admit, that's pretty impressive.
What's so good about it? I've got deadbeats who don't pay me, the city guard looking over my shoulder and Maven Black-Briar breathing down my neck.
When one can divine the future, success may not be assured... but it can at least be anticipated. It helps that I've already foretold my own death.
When questioned by the Black Door, answer with the correct passphrase: [QUOTE]Silence, my brother.[QUOTE] Then you're in. And your new life begins.
While stories have persisted since the First Era, none have ever confirmed the existence of this [QUOTE]Glamoril[QUOTE] or its purpose or function.
Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. Looks like he really did it!
Yes, but don't try to use force! He's far too mighty. He'd crush you like a clay doll, or drop you from the sky, or simply eat your brain right up!
Yes. The Torpor grants an ability the priests of Vaermina called [QUOTE]The Dreamstride[QUOTE]; using dreams to travel distances in the real world.
You are far too hard on yourself, my dear, sweet, homicidally insane Pelagius. What would the people do without you? Dance? Sing? Smile? Grow old? 
You can turn each one in as it's completed, or wait and turn in the whole group when all the targets have been eliminated. Whichever works for you.
You have to understand, Gentle Repose is a fallow festering place I should have left a long time ago. This is one of the few ways I make any money.
You see, there's a contract out on one of them, and that person can't leave this room alive. But... which one? Go on, see if you can figure it out.
You'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal rather easily.
You're... still alive. Cicero respects the Listener's abilities, of course, but could you at least slow down a bit? I'm not what I used to be. Heh.
After that, fear was enough to keep them in line. He could torture and humiliate them and they would not rebel. Even in death, they serve him still.
And deserve our praise you do, for we are one! Ere you ascended and the Eight became Nine, you walked among us, great Talos, not as god, but as man!
And you are not alone. There are others. A child of night... a stalker of the sands? Oh, but before you are family, there will be blood. Such blood.
As a rule, I'm also not crazy about the corpses of old women. For the Night Mother, I'll make an exception. But Astrid is the only mistress I serve.
Believe it or not, Festus likes you. He senses your power, your potential. Follow his instructions to the letter, and you may even earn his respect.
But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Hmmm? No. No... Of course not. Because then Cicero would get angry, and that would be... ugly.
But, that doesn't mean I won't start acting like it. There's much to do. The new Jarls need help building armies, and enforcing their right to rule.
Cicero admits, he thought the Listener would be dead by now. Heh. Maybe we could just forget all this? Hmm? Let bygones be bygones? What do you say?
Don't tell me - Sibbi and Louis Letrush? Well, Sibbi is in jail and Letrush is certainly welcome to try. My hired help is more than a match for him.
Every moment counts, so I want you to take my horse. His name is Shadowmere. You'll find him outside, by the pool. Let's just say he's... one of us.
Finally, someone comes in. Kick off your boots, stay awhile. Let me know if there's anything I can help you with. I got nothing but time these days.
First problem here is a pack of Imperial dogs drooling over resources stolen from the people. A little sabotage will sour the taste of that victory.
Hah, you have the foresight of a Khajiit in a sandstorm. If we offer a discount to both sides, the winners will persecute us for helping the losers.
Haven't you talked to Astrid? She's by the pool, greeting the Night Mother and her little jester. She has a contract for you. Come see me afterward.
He lives just outside Anga's Mill, in the woods. He was once the miller. Now Papius is just a paranoid recluse who thinks someone is out to get him.
Hey, if you find a book called [QUOTE]Night Falls on Sentinel,[QUOTE] could you bring it to me? It's a story from my wife's people. Be good to have.
I almost can't believe it. The Empire has been defeated. The world bears witness to the power and righteousness of the sons and daughters of Skyrim.
I am a part of you, little mortal. I am a shadow in your subconscious, a blemish on your fragile little psyche. You know me. You just don't know it.
I can't believe we let them take the Pale. Losing the port of Dawnstar is lessened only by the threat of Imperial forces being so close to Windhelm.
I do apologize, Listener, but Nazir made it clear the initiates are not to speak with you until you first deal with him, and atone for your actions.
I heard tell of a lad in Windhelm. Aventus Aretino. They say he's been doing the Black Sacrament, trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. Damn fool.
I'll tell you the same thing I told Skald. I'm here to help the people of Dawnstar, not play politics. Point your suspicions of treachery elsewhere.
I'm not sure why Tullius is wasting his time trying to take Winterhold from us. But if he wants to throw his men away, I'll gladly accept that gift.
I'm thinking we need that amulet appraised. I want to know where it came from, how much it's worth, and if we can actually get away with selling it.
I'm waiting on word about reinforcements for the fort... Good, they're on the way. And we have some information on enemy troop movements. Excellent.
If you've come to Solitude to join the Legion, speak to Rikke. If not, just keep your nose clean while you're here... or you'll end up like Roggvir.
Implicate and kill his son Gaius, and the commander will be grief-stricken and humiliated, his family name ruined. The security plan will then fail.
Indeed. For you, my friend, seem to understand what's truly important. When I give an order to spill blood, you follow it. No questions. No remorse.
It is said that the Dark Brotherhood, in recent years, has been in decline. That you lack the power, wealth, and respect of days past. Is it not so?
Just about eighty years ago, there was a terrible disaster. The cliffs overlooking the Sea of Ghosts collapsed, taking most of Winterhold with them.
Look at it. That's real Nord craftsmanship, that is! Let me show you an old trick I learned as a scout. Makes it harder for the enemy to notice you.
Look deeply into the faces of the warriors around you. These are the true sons and daughters of Skyrim. See her strength and nobility in their eyes.
M'aiq has heard the people of Skyrim are better looking than the ones in Cyrodiil. He has no opinion on the matter. All people are beautiful to him.
Make a thrall. Lure him to my shrine. Prove your will is stronger. Convince him to embrace the Pillar of Sacrifice, and then slay him without mercy.
Maven's disappointed that Ingun's heart isn't in the family business, but she says [QUOTE]Ingun still has her uses.[QUOTE] Not sure what that means.
Oh, but that was then! This is now! You're the Listener, and the Night Mother chose you for a reason, I'm sure! Cicero will remain the happy Keeper.
Oh, Cicero has returned! Not to kill the kind Listener, but to serve, until one of us dies horribly, in service to our Mother! Best friends forever!
Oh, yes. Presiding over the union of two lovers is one of my greatest responsibilities. It helps that Asgeir and Vittoria truly care for each other.
Ooh, ooh, what kind of message? A song? A summons? Wait, I know! A death threat written on the back of an Argonian concubine! Those are my favorite.
Ooh, you're a wizard! I mean, you cast that spell just now, yeah? I was hoping you could make me invisible or something. Can you? Make me invisible?
Really? Power? Haven't you already killed enough of your foes using the more mundane means at your disposal? Swords, magic, etc.? How... uninspired.
Samuel is getting to be a problem. Fancies himself something of a [QUOTE]leader[QUOTE] to the other children. Put an end to the nonsense, or I will.
Security is being handled by a Commander Maro. Astrid and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple the Emperor's protection.
She got sick, last winter, when the snows came. And she just... she never got better. Not all year. One night she fell asleep and...  never woke up.
Skyrim is the birthplace of humanity. The birthplace of honor. And those snowbacked Imperials renounced both when they laid down before the Thalmor.
Speak with the Dishonored Skald at the Bards College, in Solitude. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Unemployed Laborer at the Frostfruit Inn, in Rorikstead. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
The Empire thinks it holds Falkreath from us. But the souls of Skyrim's bravest are buried there and will fill our hearts and strengthen our blades.
The Greybeards have called a peace council, at High Hrothgar. And can you believe it - both Ulfric Stormcloak and General Tullius have agreed to go.
The Imperials are here. All lined up pretty-like in their shiny armor. We'll put a few dents in those bastards before we give up the city. Move it! 
The last few supply caravans have been attacked... by a giant. As if I didn't have enough to deal with. Need that damn hairy brute straightened out.
The Plains District is so named because it's the closest of the three to the plains that surround the city. The inn and marketplace are found there.
There's not much up there, but if we can regain Winterhold, our proximity to Windhelm should keep Ulfric wary and wasting troops garrisoned at home.
They'll never think to check it. Who in their right mind would hide inside? Now go. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.
This is a great day, my friend. You have struck a blow against darkness that will not soon be forgotten! Here, as promised - a most generous reward!
Wait! There's something else... A potential for adventure, and wealth. It is a ruin, ripe for the plunder. Deepwood Redoubt. Far to the northwest...
We hit 'em where it hurts. As soon as we can, we'll take over - make the needed repairs. In the meantime, the people no longer slave for the Empire.
We're supposedly at peace now. But I put in to be stationed here to keep an eye on the Thalmor. I've a feeling they're behind this unrest in Skyrim.
Well, she needs to eat. I don't think she even knows where the kitchen is. And milady isn't exactly going to remove her own chamber pot, now is she?
What? You think me too old, too feeble? There is more knowledge in me than in two of you pups put together. And knowledge... knowledge is my weapon.
With the Stormcloaks at his back, Ulfric's poised to rid Skyrim of the Empire's forces and invalidate our involvement with the White-Gold Concordat.
Yes, Yes. It is an ancient and ruined city. Built by the Dwemer. The dwarf folk. It is nearby, but I'd stay clear. People say it is quite dangerous.
You and Sam dared me to go into that bandit camp. Well I did and brought back his stupid hat like you said, so give me the 10,000 gold you promised.
You get to kill the Emperor. The bloody Emperor. You'd better enjoy this one. You owe us all that much. So make it bloody, painful, and spectacular.
You may be the Listener, or you may just be a lunatic who's started hearing voices. Either way, Astrid is still your mistress. Not the Night Mother.
You misunderstand. It's just... I feel for him, is all. To carry a weight like that. It's got to take its toll. That happened to me, I'd be a wreck.
You're here! I was wondering if that Black Sacrament even worked. I need you to kill a woman, a Poor Fishwife, on the Riften Docks. Here's the gold.
You've been directed to dispose of the Gourmet's body, is that correct? I often find water to be a suitable hiding place. A lake, a pool... the sea.
Your contract sounds simple, which means it certainly will not be. Getting into that reception will be easy, but have you thought about getting out?

Agna once told me there is a secret room deeper in where they buried disgraced members of the family. Maybe that will get us into the main chamber...
All right, so Cicero attacked that harlot, Astrid! But what's a fool to do, when his mother is slandered and mocked? Surely the Listener understands!
An ancient city, Markarth. Build by the Dwemer, the dwarves of old. To think, an entire race... eradicated. Not even I can take credit for that feat.
And I need capable and loyal warriors close at hand. So I'd like to offer you a home in Windhelm. Speak with my steward who'll make the arrangements.
And there it is, friends! The ugly truth! We are the children of man! Talos is the true god of man! Ascended from flesh, to rule the realm of spirit!
Bah. If it were up to me, we'd cut off your hands and never let you back in this Sanctuary. But no. All you have to do is pay Nazir a fine. Pathetic.
But I slashed him good. Pretty sure I severed an artery. Don't know what you're going to find in there... but you can probably just follow the blood.
But it's more myth than anything at this point. I've no doubt that it actually exists, but no one has seen it in what, decades? Longer? I'm not sure.
But legend holds, his body was secretly returned to Skyrim and buried with the crown. Its exact whereabouts lost in the following Wars of Succession.
But those are the words. The Binding Words. Written in the Keeping Tomes. The signal so I would know. Mother's only way of talking to sweet Cicero...
But when the Night Mother speaks, the Listener must obey. You must! For her word is the will of Sithis. And Sithis is the Dark Brotherhood incarnate.
Enough! We can't imprison the very people that own the jail we would be throwing them into. The Silver-Blood family are to be left alone, am I clear?
Forgive me for worrying about the future of Markarth. The lifeblood of a city is gold, Igmund, and it doesn't stop bleeding because there's a war on.
Give me the letter. Bring Mallory the amulet. Find out everything you can, and sell it if he's willing. He'll offer a letter of credit - that's fine.
He mostly just hangs about. Goes down to the lake, sometimes samples the stores of wine in the cellar. Man can do whatever he pleases, far as I care.
Heh. Chamber fit for a king and all that, right? No problem. Give ya a big bed, decorate the room real nice, maybe even throw in a few extra baubles.
Hmm... Yes, I've heard about all that fuss. I myself know it's all a terrible, terrible misunderstanding. I'm quite sure you're innocent in all this.
Hmph. Yes. Yes, I surely can. It's not something I do lightly, mind you, and it's not as specific as you might want. But yes. I will do this for you.
Hmph. You know, you've got a certain... fire in your eyes. Just like my Beirand did. Please, feel free to look around. We've got a bit of everything.
I had an uncle, you see. He made certain... unwanted advances. So I killed him. And liked it. Then I killed again. And liked it even more. And so on.
I just wanted to take this time to thank you all for being here. To thank you for sharing this wonderfully happy day with myself, and my new husband.
I know Galmar. We fought in many wars together. He's not a sentimental man taken to fancy. If he believes the crown is there... he's likely found it.
I often think about High Hrothgar. It's very... disconnected from the troubles down here. But that's why I couldn't stay, and why I couldn't go back.
I remember one morning, long time ago, I woke up and the place was run by some Orcs. Went to bed that night, it was all vampires. Don't matter to me.
I spent thousands of septims and used every contact at my disposal, but it was as if she had simply vanished... like I said before, she was the best.
I want you to go to that ruin, find Alain Dufont, and kill him. I don't care about his friends. Do whatever you want with them. But Alain has to die!
I was just wondering. The next time we meet, do you think maybe you could teach me some fire magic? Nothing dangerous! Maybe a candle lighting spell?
I went on to teach at the College - left after two years. Too simple. Too safe. None of them truly understood the glory of the Destruction school... 
I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself. But more importantly, I made this Sanctuary some much needed gold. In the end, that's all that matters.
I'm not exactly... comfortable around guards or jails. Definitely not when associates of mine have been locked up. No, I'll meet you outside of town.
I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you, he'd have the Jarl bent around his little finger.
I'm the fence down here. You come by anything you don't exactly own and I'll pay you some coin for it. Minus a little slice for the Guild, of course.
I've cooked every dish in your book, and I must say your brilliance is inspiring. My technique surely doesn't even approach yours... but whose would?
If the Tenets were still in place, you would be required to defeat the Wrath of Sithis. Now you just need to pay a fine to Nazir. Ah, the Old Ways...
If you don't mind digging, I own the Quicksilver Mine. It's a better life than working in that damned Iron-Breaker Mine with all those milk drinkers.
If you would, please also contain your summons to the College grounds. The locals do not need to be agitated further by Atronachs roaming their town.
In fact, I once took a seaside stroll, on a moonlit night, and discovered a unicorn... which I proceeded to stab in the throat with a crochet needle.
It is whispered that one of the Daedric Princes himself is behind the murder of Elisif. It would seem even the nobility of Oblivion favors our cause.
It matters little if some of the people here are ignorant to that truth. They are still citizens of the Empire. It's our solemn duty to protect them.
It matters not. The plant cares nothing for the rays that bring it the warmth of the sun. As you carry Dawnbreaker, so will my light touch the world.
It would seem that you have yet to reach a level of skill that the College would find valuable, so I'm afraid I can't allow you to join at this time.
It's no secret the Aretino boy is doing some ritual, trying to call the Dark Brotherhood. But who's going to stop him? Me? I'll have no part of that.
King Harald's forces crushed stragglers here the during the First Era and it has been haunted ever since, but the specifics of the siege are unclear.
Listen, when you're finished with this Emperor business, meet Babette and me there. I'll find some way to move the Night Mother. Don't worry. Now go!
My parents are long dead, but they lived wonderful lives... I have no sad stories to tell about them. Perhaps one day I'll visit their resting place.
No. I trust you'll do more good out there in the world, wherever you damn well please to go. You're a true daughter of Skyrim and'll know what to do.
Not much to it, really. We fish, and keep to ourselves. Try to keep from upsetting the Empire or the Stormcloaks, and so far the war's left us alone.
Not ready? Well, my arrogant little sibling, until you pay the fine the Dark Brotherhood holds nothing for you. No contracts. No rewards. No respect.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have nothing more to discuss. I encourage you to take your time and enjoy yourself. You look like you could use the rest.
Of course, because of our separation, Vile is now much weaker. I guess he figured it was a small price to pay for not having to listen to me anymore.
Oh, and please, take this as payment. It's an old family heirloom, supposed to be pretty valuable. It should fetch you a nice price. Thank you again!
Oh, but he probably won't do those things to you. Probably. Just remind him to come home, and... there'll be no fighting or unpleasantness. Probably.
Oh, yes. A secret family recipe. The only good thing my father Octieve ever did. In fact, it's so good, no one else in Skyrim even tries to make any.
Oh. Well, um, actually... you're not. Wearing a chef's hat, I mean. There's one right over there on the shelf. You can't very well cook without it...
Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up.
Only, she was gone. Shipped away to another orphanage, or adopted, or... I didn't know what else to do, so I came back, hoping nobody noticed I left.
Our actual position and policies are irrelevant. No matter the facts of the response, it will certainly be twisted to suit the whims of either group.
Please, mister. You got to get me out of here. Ever since Aventus left, Grelod's been even meaner than usual. I swear, she's going to kill one of us.
Please! I don't know! I mean, I'm a soldier. I've killed people. When I was ordered to. Maybe there were some times... some times I got carried away?
Really? Great! Okay. So, first, you raise your ward and I'll throw a little spell at it. That way I can see the [QUOTE]right[QUOTE] way to do things.
Reclaiming Hjaalmarch lets me worry less about the rear guard, and push more men to the front. It was a mistake to let Ulfric control it for so long.
Right. The leader of our fight against the Empire. I forget that most people don't know what he looks like, except for those Imperial wanted posters.
Secondly, we got more of 'em hiding in a village, using the local populace as shields. Not to worry. We can dispatch them without harming the locals.
See those stones peeking through the surface? Used to be an old Imperial fort on the lake. Really! Stories say it up and sunk one day, but who knows?
Seems the Emperor realized his presence would necessitate a more direct role in the ongoing hostilities. A role he was, obviously, unwilling to take.
Since we share the same opinion of them, let me warn you that they're recruiting others to join their [QUOTE]guild[QUOTE] and you should be cautious.
Speak with the Griefstricken Chef, at the Windpeak Inn, here in Dawnstar. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. Hail the Listener! Hail Sithis!
Suddenly an explosion of magic in the refugee quarter. Thalmor mages were attacking the Altmer dissidents who were resisting with magic of their own.
Taking the Pale gives us another port in Dawnstar, and puts us within striking distance of Windhelm. That should make Ulfric a bit more cautious, eh?
Tell me you've seen them. Those... things. Small and evil, like something out of a nightmare. They come from Stillborn Cave, to the north. I know it.
That hammer... Why that's Aegisbane, heirloom of Clan Shatter-Shield! Last I heard, it was stolen by a couple of swindlers. Alain and... Muiri. Yeah.
The Gourmet is scheduled to cook for the Emperor at a special dinner. You'll kill him, steal his Writ of Passage, and assume the roll of master chef.
The logistics of such an endeavor will be staggering, I know. There will be several minor assassinations necessary. Leading up to the... main target.
The news is the same as it's been for the rest of the war, your grace. Our borders are secure, but at the cost of the guards for our towns and roads.
The only possible help I've come across are the remains of some poor fellow who was trying to follow in your footsteps. Perhaps his journal can help?
There are so few rules here. All we ask is that you don't disrespect your Family. But for some reason, you have. Best talk to Nazir and pay the fine.
They own Cidhna Mine, one of the toughest jails in Skyrim. I was hoping I could buy or steal the deed, but I don't think that's how things work here.
Through there is... Hag's End. The last resting place of an assassin of old. A Dark Brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you.
To convince her I want to read King Olaf's Verse. A part of the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Unfortunately the verse was lost long ago.
To what end? Usurping Astrid's authority as leader of the Sanctuary? Hmmm... Yes, I can see her concern. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
Truth is, we are in no danger whatsoever. Killing an Emperor can be useful, but befriending one? Now that's beneficial - as I'm sure you'd all agree.
Was it Molag? No, no... Little Tim, the toymaker's son? The ghost of King Lysandus? Or was it... Yes! Stanley, that talking grapefruit from Passwall.
We come to this moment carried by the sacrifices and courage of our fellows. Those who have fallen. And those still bearing the shields to our right.
We thought he was here to ask Torygg to declare independence. By the time we realized Ulfric was here to challenge Torygg... it was already too late.
Welcome to Riften, home of the Thieves Guild. Or so they'd have you believe. It's all lies. They're just thugs... vermin, creeping around the Ratway.
Well, I'm glad we've established this early, rather than me hearing about it years or decades later when the whispers behind my back are loud enough.
When you disrespect your Family, you disrespect yourself. Don't you care for anything at all? Prove that you do - speak with Nazir, make reparations.
Yeah, we can do that. I'm thinking a sewer grate on the outskirts of Dawnstar. Leads to a tunnel, then inside. You'll be in or out, quick as a coney.
Yes, Listener! I will remain in this very spot until you tell me otherwise. Spiders could eat my face off and faithful Cicero would not move an inch!
You are to slay the commander's son, Gaius Maro, and once he is dead, plant false evidence on his body implicating him in a plot to kill the Emperor.
You didn't hear this from me, but we've uncovered a plot to kill the Emperor! It gets better. The ringleader? One of the Emperor's own elite guard...
You don't want to go up to that farmhouse, citizen. It's a terrible sight. The farmer and his wife, slaughtered in the night. So many knife wounds...
You know, the law here in Solitude can be a bit... [QUOTE]flexible.[QUOTE] So long as you've got the gold. That's the way the Thieves Guild likes it.
You should head to the Frozen Hearth and speak with Nelacar. It's his story to tell, and I wouldn't want to discredit him by talking behind his back.
You! You're responsible for the siege of that... city! By Sithis, this undermines all our plans! Fool! Finish that mess, and only then will we speak!
You'll find Windhelm's full of dark elves. The kind from Morrowind, you know. Not that I have anything against them, long as they keep to themselves.
You're alive! I'm impressed! Galmar had his doubts about you, but I knew you'd pull through. You should speak with him. He's going to need your help.
You're headed to The Hag's Cure, right? It's a good shop. You should examine their wares. Never pass up the chance to buy a good potion... or poison.
I assume they were after her valuables... she always wore far too much jewelry in public. When I told her it'd be the death of her, I never thought...
I know some of you are ex-legion and may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and they will not hesitate to kill you.
