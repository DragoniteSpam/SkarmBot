Free me, and I will carry you to Skuldafn.
Dovahkiin zol mul. Zu'u gahvon miri Alduin.
A captive dragon, just think of the possibilities!
Begone, mage. Do not test my promise to the Dovahkiin.
May Kynareth guard you while you pass through her realm!
Carry on, soldier. This is all part of the Dragonborn's plan.
A dragon in Dragonsreach. That's something I never saw coming.
Is it true? Did you really capture a dragon on the Great Porch?
You're either the bravest person I've ever met, or the biggest fool.
Surely you wouldn't miss a few scales... or a small amount of blood...
So my brother really did it. Whiterun will be the toast of Skyrim for this!
Onikaan koraav gein miraad. It is wise to recognize when you only have one choice.
Incredible! Uh... sir, you have no idea how long I have waited for such an opportunity!
This is far as I can take you. Krif voth ahkrin. I will look for your return, or Alduin's.
I'll be glad when this beast is gone from here. Do whatever it is you need to do with it, Dragonborn.
And you can trust me. Zu'u ni tahrodiis. Alduin has proven himself unworthy to rule. I go my own way now.
I'll be glad when that beast is gone from Dragonsreach. I never understood what the point of all this was.
Capturing that dragon was a mighty deed. In my younger days, I'd have been the first to join in the attempt.
I assure you, you will not even notice me. Most of them are hardly painful at all to a large dragon such as yourself.
I admit, I doubted you, but no more. You've made a dragon submit to your will. A feat to rival the legendary Olaf One-Eye! What glory!
I would be most appreciative if you would permit me to perform some, ah, tests on you. Purely in the interests of the advancement of knowledge.
Fine. Take it!
I don't believe you. That's not your way.
Once the new owner finds out I gave in, I'm as good as dead anyway.
For all of us.
Not for us, it isn't.
Very little. It's an uncertain time.
Have you scried anything new in the entrails?
Come back to me when you have something useful.
From Adrianne?
Thank you. Please, take these few coins, for services rendered.
Ah, this must be that weapon for the Jarl. Poor girl, so eager to prove herself. I'll present it to Balgruuf when his mood is... agreeable.
Go ahead. Eat.
Glory to Namira!
I will feast on you!
Glory to the repulsive!
You're my... friend....
Namira grants us victory.
To Oblivion with you then!
Namira covets your ugliness.
Say hello to Verulus for me.
Draugr are below. Foul tasting.
I will be waiting at Reachcliff.
Priest of Arkay. I'm your friend.
We will sate the hunger together.
The dead exist to feed the living.
Who... who are you? What's going on?
Namira grind your bones for my bread!
Soon, Namira's blessing will be yours.
Blessed are the forgotten. The wretched.
Come with me. Our feast is about to begin.
Not here. We will meet at Reachcliff Cave.
I need to lay down. I'll just be a minute....
The meal is on Namira's table. Go ahead. Carve.
I will drink your blood and feast on your flesh!
Don't fear the unknown, the hidden, the wretched.
I've been invited to dinner.... I'm so hungry....
The shrine of Namira is further inside. Keep going.
Don't worry, the Eight are watching over us. I hope.
He looks so... sweet. Go ahead. Have the first bite.
The shrine of Namira is beyond that door. Get ready.
Yes. I'm your friend, and I've invited you to dinner.
Bring Verulus here. The Lady of Decay will do the rest.
Why don't you lay down and rest, while we get the meal ready?
Many used to come to these caves. The forgotten. The wretched.
And when he stands in Namira's presence, she will take care of the rest.
A priest, filled with the taste of an easy life. Brother Verulus, from Markarth.
Give him this gold. Tell him you need Arkay's help exploring an old cavern for treasure.
A lot of our kind block out the memory of their first meal. The shame is too much. But you don't need to hide anymore.
Namira, the Lady of Decay, accepts you for what you are. She has a place for us, where we can sate our appetites without judgment.
Good riddance.
I'll take care of it.
Good training.
Only that it happened.
Our father, Jergen, raised us here.
Fortune and glory, friend. Fortune and glory.
Of course, the money is still good. And the drinks!
The Companions let me fight for gold, and so I fight.
Vilkas and I have been here since we were little whelps.
Even Vignar couldn't remember Companions younger than us!
I love my brother, but his brains are not his strong suit.
So I wouldn't have to answer stupid questions from idiots.
Skjor says it was more like forty, but he's just being modest.
Like most of our band, I found this family after losing my own.
Wandered around as a blade for hire. Was a damned good one, too.
Are you kidding? I've wanted to be with them since I was a little girl.
He brought me back here, and I realized... that I was actually coming home.
When you get to be my age, you don't remember why you did much of anything.
We were brought here by Jergen. Whether he was our father or not, I don't care.
Where else would I want to be but here? Learning from them, fighting at their sides.
He left to fight in the Great War and never came back. So he's not my problem anymore.
We've been here as long as either of us can remember, though. So try to show some respect.
To hear Farkas tell it, our father raised us here as happy pups, running around biting knees.
I traveled the length and breadth of this land, learning all I could of the sword and the axe.
I learned the ways of the blade in the Great War. Nearly lost my life outside the Imperial City.
Haven't you heard the stories of Kodlak and Skjor fighting off the hundred-and-one Orc berserkers?
I came home to Skyrim when it was all over. But I wasn't much good at anything other than fighting.
My mother was a Companion. And her mother. And all the women in my family, back to Hrotti Blackblade.
I was just a boy, but I had the fire of a man in my heart. Eventually, my body caught up to my spirit.
The money was good, and the women were good, and the drinks were good. But I was losing myself. My heart.
Ma didn't live long enough to see me join, but I fight to honor her and all my Shield-Sisters through time.
My predecessor, Askar, found me in Hammerfell. I was serving as bodyguard for some weak-necked lord out there.
I stayed with my father in the woods until I was old enough for my Trial. We hunted everything there was to hunt.
A man of my station has many debts. I'm not much use at labor or learning, but I can throw a punch with the best of 'em.
Oh, I'm not a Companion, myself. I just help Vignar. He took me in when I was having a tough time, and... well, I owe him.
I was lucky the Companions found me. Now there's a reason to be fighting. The honor of my brothers and sisters is worth more than coin.
I work to bring honor to this family, and to the family that I lost. For my mother, my father, and my grandfather. For all my Shield-Siblings.
Ha! Found you!
I hate this game.
You want something?
I'm gonna find you, Elf!
Something I can get for you?
That's because you always lose... Elf.
If you need a drink, just say the word.
Someday I'm gonna grow up and be the Jarl.
We're playing Hunt the Elf. You're the Elf.
My pa says elves are bad and not to trust 'em.
If there's anything you need, just let me know.
Good morning, Assur. What do you want to do today?
Why do I always have to be the Elf? I don't want to!
I'm just trying to have a quiet drink here, all right?
Let me know if you need anything. We're here to provide.
Assur and I are playing a game. Don't tell him where I am!
Just say the word if you need a drink or something to eat.
Those cursed mages... It's their fault Winterhold is gone.
It's not like there's anything to do here but drink anyway.
You ask me, not enough of Winterhold fell off into the sea.
Hard to believe I ever complained about Riften being cold...
Keep clear of the College, and keep yourself out of trouble.
Driven out of my own home. After all this, I can't believe it.
Winterhold belongs to Skyrim, not the Imperials, or the Mages.
Assur had to move away because of the Empire. But we get to stay.
Winterhold might yet thrive if that College had never been built.
Few will admit it, but we know the truth about the Great Collapse.
Without us looking out for Winterhold, it's doomed. Simply doomed.
My job is to serve the Jarl, not waste time talking with travelers.
Nothing to do here but drink till you forget you got nothing to do.
Unless you're bringin' me another round, you can just keep walking.
Winterhold may not look impressive, but it has a very rich history.
Winterhold was once the capital of Skyrim, you know. Quite an honor.
I'd like nothing more than to see Winterhold regain its former glory.
The College of Winterhold is truly an asset to our city... err, town.
People won't say it, but they're afraid of me, so they leave me alone.
Things are easier now that I don't have to worry about Ranmir anymore.
With the Empire's help, Winterhold will be back on its feet in no time.
I have a very close relationship with Savos Aren, the current Arch-Mage.
Most of our business comes from folks traveling to and from the College.
There's yet hope that our relationship with the College can be repaired.
I still can't believe you were able to help Ranmir pull himself together.
My days at the College are long behind me, but I prefer to stay close by.
Ours is the only family left that truly cares what happens to Winterhold.
I'm trying to do as little as possible. You're getting in the way of that.
We don't get many people like you visiting Winterhold. Usually it's elves.
I'm just the Housecarl. If you need something, you should speak to Kraldar.
The mages don't let us go in the College. They said it's not safe in there.
Turns out who runs Winterhold doesn't change much. Can't say I'm surprised.
I don't deal with any College applicants these days, so don't bother asking.
I heard the College teaches you how to kill people with magic. Is that true?
I'm very busy, you know. I'm the only one Kraldar can rely on to assist him.
Kraldar has big plans for Winterhold. We'd be better off if he was in charge.
You know Winterhold used to be the seat of power in Skyrim? Now it's a shell.
Winterhold doesn't offer much, but we like living here. Been here all our lives.
Without all our money going to drink, I can afford to expand my selection a bit.
Assur always wants to play [QUOTE]Hunt the Elf[QUOTE] and he makes me be the Elf.
I'll sell just about anything, if it's worth my time. Keep that in mind, will you?
The College is the worst thing that's ever happened to Winterhold, maybe to Skyrim.
Thonjolf is convinced I've got some connections at the College, so he goes easy on me.
Too bad. That's what we're playing, and you're the Elf. Now go hide so I can hunt you!
Pa says the Empire made us leave, but the Empire just does whatever the elves tell them to.
Assur is going to grow up to be a great man, because he'll have lived through such hardship.
I'd rather see the Sea of Ghosts swallow Winterhold entirely than have it run by the Empire.
Kraldar's family was once very powerful in Winterhold. It's my honor to assist him even now.
My brother's a good-for-nothing drunk. We'd have lost the house by now if it were up to him.
The Mages at the College keep to themselves for the most part, so we don't see much of them.
Did you know that most of Winterhold fell into the sea? I heard it's because of that College.
I'm not one to complain, but I'm not sure why Kraldar insists on keeping Malur Seloth around.
I won't complain about Korir being gone, but I don't expect things to really be any different.
If you're looking for Ranmir, he's either passed out in bed, or working on winding up that way.
I do what's necessary so we can get by. Have to, since I can't count on my brother for anything.
It's hard to recover from something like the Great Collapse, but I believe Winterhold can do it.
We do the best we can, even though we have next to nothing. But we Nords don't give up, not ever.
I don't care how many Colleges they build, or how much the sea swallows up. I'll outlast them all.
Ranmir has no problem drinking himself under the table, so I have to be the one to make ends meet.
How come you're in Winterhold? My pa says people like you are the reason no one lives here anymore.
I don't really know anyone at the College. I guess everyone just assumes I do because I'm a Dunmer.
Take care if you're venturing too far from town. That's a bitter wind coming off the Sea of Ghosts.
Unlike some folks here in town, we have nothing against the College or the people that come and go.
Don't worry about those Stormcloaks. You're safe from them here. As if they'd want the place anyway.
Assur says his pa says the College made lots of bad things happen, but the mages I've seen look nice.
If you're here for the College, don't let the folks in town bother you. Just try and keep to yourself.
If you're here for sight-seeing, well then you've seen the sights. Might as well head somewhere warmer.
There's not many people left in Winterhold, so I only have Assur to play with, and sometimes he's mean.
It turns out that if people think you're some sort of secret wizard, they'll let you get away with a lot.
Just because we live in the middle of nowhere doesn't give Ranmir the right to drink himself into oblivion.
Dagur and I have an understanding. He gives me privacy, and I make sure my experiments don't blow up his inn.
Some people can't be trusted to accomplish anything that's asked of them. They don't take pride in their work.
Korir will be the first to tell you that if it weren't for that College, we'd all be better off. I agree with him.
We may not have as much to offer as Whiterun or Solitude, but we'll do what we can to make your stay a pleasant one.
If you've business with the College, you're welcome to stay here. It's where most of our business comes from, in fact.
It wasn't enough that the College still stands, now the damnable Empire has Winterhold. I hope they all freeze to death.
Don't worry about Nelacar. He has a permanent room here at the Inn, but he keeps to himself and doesn't cause any trouble.
Empire's in charge now, huh? Only a matter of time before we start getting bothered by them Thalmoricars... err, Justimors... Y'know, them elves.
Ha! Wonderful!
Like I said, the guard is down by the road. You really can't miss him.
You tell him that jester is up to no good, and he'll deal with it. Then come back here, and I'll toss a few coins your way, yeah?
Happy hunting.
Well then, your timing couldn't be better.
I'm sorry, I don't. Come see me again later.
Your first target is an Orc bard named Lurbuk. The other is a vampire by the name of Hern.
More work? My friend, you still haven't finished the last two contracts I gave you. Let's get those done, hmm?
As a matter of fact, I do. Two of them. One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge.
As it turns out, I've got two new contracts. One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge.
More work? My friend, you still haven't finished the last set of contracts I gave you. Why don't you concentrate on eliminating that final target.
Help! In here!
Intruder! Help!
Over here! Hurry!
Backup! I need some help in here!
I know, but...
No way. I'm quick!
And you'll be trampled to death!
Mama, when can we go play in the river again?
Well why don't you be quick about finding my book that you lost?
Not with all those soldiers all over the hold. Their horses can't see you, you know.
I smell blood.
Get a bad feeling.
Smell that? Blood.
Keep your eyes open.
Get ready for a fight.
Keep your blade ready.
Something smells foul.
Yuck. Something smells.
Get ready. Trouble ahead.
Trouble is in the air here.
Don't like the looks of this.
I don't like where this is going.
Got a feeling there's trouble ahead.
I don't think I like where this is going.
I have a feeling there's going to be trouble.
I'm impressed.
That was a good bit of work.
I applaud anyone who assists the court.
I suppose I would, but you're the only one who gets that greeting.
Wait. You're that new bard, the one who saved the Festival. Aren't you?
Radiant Raiment has the finest attire in all of Skyrim. That is how we...
It's never been an issue. People say you helped with the problems at Wolfskull Cave.
Oh, we do all right. Rumor is, you had a hand in the Blackblood Marauders' demise...
Radiant Raiment has the finest attire in all of Skyrim. That is how we get business.
If you say so.
Is he... dead?
Is she... dead?
Looks dead to me.
Is that the murderer?
You there! Wait a moment.
Oh no... what happened here?
Not sure, let's watch and find out.
Alright now. Everyone back away. Let the law handle this.
If anyone saw anything, step forward. Otherwise, step away from the body!
Is that so...?
Ah yes, you were with us at Helgen.
Let's do that.
No you aren't.
That's just terrible. I'm so sorry to hear that.
What are you, blind? That store is empty. Forsworn get almost every shipment that comes in.
Another drink, Cosnach? A porter with Arnleif and Sons deserves nothing but the finest here.
I wasn't aware that Lisbet was having trouble, Cosnach. Is Arnleif and Sons not doing a good turn of business these days?
All your drinks are watered down, Kleppr. You aren't fooling me, and you know Lisbet can't afford to pay me enough for the finest drinks anyhow.
No. I mean it.
Nah. Just... don't. Leave me outta it.
When I'm known throughout Tamriel, you'll regret this decision.
No interest in being immortalized in song? Remembered and praised for all eternity?
I'm thinking of composing a song about you, Jonna. Would you prefer that I proclaim your beauty, your strength, your...
Not him again.
Funny, I'd have thought she would've gone back to him by now.
He came nosing around Riften a while back, making a lot of noise about me. He was... persuaded to leave before he found me.
Not often, no.
We also must make an effort to avoid worsening what Skyrim thinks of us.
Some risks must be taken, to be sure. I am simply trying to avoid untimely deaths.
Not right now.
Oh my. That...
You... you go first.
No! Someone help me! Please!
Ohh... ughh...
Unghhh... oww...
The pain is so great...
The fever... my body burns...
So sick... can hardly stand it...
I can't bear it... make it stop...
Patience, boy.
Why do you ask me that?
Are the gods angry with me?
Then they should send one they consider worthy.
Why else have they cursed me? Killed all my wives?
Perhaps it's actually a sign of their love for you. They don't want to see you with unworthy mates.
Put that down.
Careful with that.
Really? Where?
Right, then...
Work, damn you!
Perhaps a little harder?
Hmm. That... That didn't really do anything, did it?
Everyone knows the dwarves disappeared. No one knows why.
I don't understand. This should produce some notable effect.
Lacking the heart of a dead god, I am substituting the crystal you helped craft in its place.
I certainly don't expect it to have quite the same results. I'm no tonal architect, of course!
But please, don't leave. You've been instrumental in this process. I'd like you to see the results first-hand.
Well, I suppose it's time, isn't it? Let's see what happens. You, uhh... You may want to stand back a step or two.
I apologize if I have not been clear about my work. I didn't want to discuss it for fear this moment might never come.
I also lack Sunder, the counterpart to the dagger Keening. I am reasonably, confident, however, that this will still work.
This little experiment is a first step in recreating the events of their disappearance in an effort to unravel that mystery.
See ya' round.
Hang on Mercer! I'm coming to help!
Come on, we need to show the journal to the Guild.
I'll watch for Mercer, just get the information we need.
This is gettin' dangerous. Don't let anythin' get the jump on you.
If you find Mercer, give no quarter... kill him and be done with it.
While you're in there, help yourself to anything in Frey's manor. I would.
Careful at Mercer's place, I don't want to lose anyone else to that madman.
Should be fun.
From the look of it, I'd bet it leads straight into the prison.
We'll stand guard out here and rush in as soon as we hear fighting.
We found a cave under the lake. With luck, it'll lead into the prison.
There's a grate outside the wall. Looks like it used to be buried in snow. I don't think they know it's there.
I need you to sneak in there, and free our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the prisoners, head out to the courtyard.
Shut up, scum.
I said shut up, scum!
So it's okay if your people rebel against the Empire, but not mine?
Hey, jailor! What I don't understand is why you're siding with the Imperials.
I mean, the Redguards fought off the Aldmeri and the Empire, and now Hammerfell is an independent state. That's all we Nords want for Skyrim!
They aren't my [QUOTE]people.[QUOTE] I'm with the Empire because they pay me. And that means I'm out here, and you're in there. So shut up, scum!
Suit yourself.
Thank you sir.
Don't let my brother get to you, Tekla. You're doing a fine job around here.
That's right.
The Arch-Mage.
There you are.
Tread lightly.
Shor's bones... how did they find this place?
Looks like someone's been digging here. And recently.
Old Nord sacrifice place. Be careful around here. Let's look for a way to open the bars.
Be careful around the burial stones. I don't want to haul you back to Jorrvaskr on my back.
This looks like the guardian chamber. The key to that door has to be around here somewhere.
Now look what you've gotten yourself into. No worries. Just sit tight. I'll find the release.
[QUOTE]Every door has a key,[QUOTE] says Vilkas. Sometimes he is wrong, but look around anyway.
Ah, the ceremonial juncture. The old Nords used to do sacrifices here. Look around for a way to open those bars.
Uh, yes ma'am.
Work hard, now! The pride of Iron-Breaker Mine is on the line.
Pride of the what? This isn't the Legion, boss. We're miners, not soldiers.
You'll shut your mouth and get back to work, or you won't be a miner or a soldier by the day's end. Hear me?
Untie me. Now.
You'll pay for this....
Don't know what that man expects. House is empty.
What happened?
Do you see that?
Don't touch anything!
There! Now attack it!
Nothing seems to work!
Hold on, my boy. Hold on!
What could this place be?
Hold on, my dear. Hold on!
This is exciting, isn't it?
This is simply fascinating.
Why, this is utterly unique.
Hold, mage, and listen well...
Be prepared to defend yourself.
I'm not so sure we should be here.
Well now... would you look at that.
Who knows what we might find in here.
Don't worry, I'll stay right with you.
I'm not the only one seeing this, am I?
And here we all are. Shall we step inside?
Why is this buried so far within Saarthal?
I thought it high time I caught up with you.
J'zargo finds nothing but dust in these ruins.
I never imagined we'd find something like this.
I wonder... what effect might your spells have?
I'll be amazed if we find anything useful here.
You know, there might be gold somewhere in here.
Keep it busy. I'll try to drain some of its power!
Well, this is highly unusual. And very interesting.
All right, everyone. Let's be careful, but have fun!
It's going to take forever to sift through all this.
Take great care, and know that the Order is watching.
Now, let's see. What shall we have the rest of you do?
I find it hard to believe this excavation was approved.
Please be careful here. The site isn't entirely secured.
Well, certainly none of this will benefit my research...
I'm not sure what to expect here. Please be on your guard.
Judgment has not been passed, as you had no way of knowing.
This is all very strange. I've never seen anything like this.
Why in the world would this be sealed off? What is this place?
What... What was that? Everything seemed to shimmer for a moment.
You, mage, and you alone, have the potential to prevent disaster.
This warning is passed to you because the Psijic Order believes in you.
This is better than sitting around talking about magic, don't you think?
Know that you have set in motion a chain of events that cannot be stopped.
Some kind of resonance... you and the wall. It must be connected to the amulet!
Do you think there's treasure here? Something to make J'zargo a powerful wizard?
To think, my ancestors destroyed the homes of Onmund's ancestors. So much bloodshed.
I think perhaps it might be best if you lead the way. My eyes aren't what they used to be.
I wonder if everyone else would be so happy to rifle through the bones of their ancestors.
Can you imagine what it was like, living here so long ago? The first men in Tamriel, here...
Judgment will be passed on your actions to come, and how you deal with the dangers ahead of you.
Onmund, please search that area over there. See if you notice any... residual energies. Alive or undead.
I'm not seeing signs of any warding magics at all. Either they're not here, or they were removed long ago.
As some of you may know, Saarthal was one of the earliest Nord settlements in Skyrim. It was also the largest.
This is an exciting opportunity for us. To be able to study such an early civilization, and the magics they used...
Sacked by the elves in the infamous [QUOTE]Night of Tears,[QUOTE] not much is known about what happened to Saarthal.
Brelyna, my dear, why don't you search for warding magics. Anything designed to keep people out. Don't interact with them, just identify them.
J'zargo... what shall we have you do... Ah! Why don't you verify that we're the first ones here? Look for any amount of tampering with the tombs.
What's it say?
With pleasure.
Would you now?
Well, spit it out. What's the matter?
Yes, Listener.
Ooh! Listener! That tickles!
Yes, Thongvor.
Except the ones attacked by Forsworn.
How goes the trade in and out of the city?
Well yes, of course you had to go and mention that.
The Forsworn aren't our real concern, defeating the Imperials and making sure we keep control of this city is.
Very well, Thongvor. With the Stormcloaks here to help, the Silver-Blood family control nearly every route in and out of the city.
Yes, yes I do.
Do you ever get tired of long nights at the mill, Zaria?
Do you ever get tired of the long days on the farm, Mathias?
Yes. He'll do.
Another soul for the master!
We can just sacrifice another disciple. Apprentice Haerlon will be no great waste.
More souls are needed for the Star. The last one died before he could be harvested.
We can't take another villager from the surface so soon. I told you to prepare everything properly!
Yes... father.
Take it easy, father. You're making a scene.
Now, do me the honor I deserve as your father and drink up!
I'll rest easy when we've driven every last Imperial pig back across the Jerall Mountains!
Drink up, my boy! Drink to those who have fallen! May their souls find their way to Sovngarde!
You're joking.
...the Emperor.
I'm sure someone of your disposition will probably even find it enjoyable.
But you should know that these killings are but a means to an end. For they pave the way to the most important target.
The real reason I'm speaking with a cutthroat in the bowels of this detestable crypt. For I seek the assassination of...
As I said, I want you to kill several people. You'll find the targets, as well as their manners of elimination, quite varied.
A guest, oh my!
Oh my, a guest!
Why don't you stay a while?
Please, make yourself at home!
Is Hert his sister or his wife? Or both?
We've been looking for someone to join us in a hunt.
Lone travelers can find these woods a little treacherous.
Hern and I do so adore guests! These guards are such a bore.
Just my luck, stuck in the sticks with this crazy old woman.
The patrols never seem to give us time to be alone, the nosy pests.
I grew up hearing songs about Eyldi the Bear! She wrestled a storm out of the sky!
Hert keeps giving me this look. I don't know if she wants me or if she wants to eat me.
And he's right.
He lives just outside Anga's Mill, in the woods. He was once the miller. Now Papius is just a paranoid recluse who thinks someone is out to get him.
And you are...?
Welcome. I don't believe we've met. I am Elenwen, the Thalmor Ambassador to Skyrim.
Are you asleep?
Yes, what is it?
Yes, suffer for you.
I'm sorry my Brother.
Yes, yes, as with you. Now be off.
Yes, a sign. We are lost without your guidance.
We've been here so long and what do we have to show for it?
Now leave me to my sleep. My strength and patience are waning.
I know you can't hear me, brother. I don't like what we've become.
I'm sorry to wake you, my Brother. I have a request from Orchendor.
Yes, my Brother. Forgive me. May the blessing of Peryite be with you.
If we do not please you, give us a sign so that we may understand why.
He has shown us that our suffering is not a punishment, but a blessing.
Orchendor promised a place where we would be accepted and taken care of.
He requests more barrels of ichor to be delivered to the Arcanex tomorrow.
Forgive me for saying this, brother, but I have not felt Peryite's presence.
This is the reason you wake me? I already have Orchendor's request taken care of.
He promised Peryite would be present at all times and give us comfort in our suffering.
Yes, a blessing. For many months we have sought your guidance, yet we have heard nothing from you.
Yes, show yourself to us. Until that day, we will continue to devote our lives to you and suffer for you.
I want out. I want to leave this place. I long for the fresh air of the Reach. This place only makes us sicker.
But who am I kidding, I know you wouldn't let me leave, brother. You truly believe in Orchendor and his promises.
Peryite, heed our call if you deem us worthy. Our leader, Orchendor, has led us here and for that we are thankful.
I know this place will eventually kill us. I have come to accept that. But I will always regret that day I introduced you to Orchendor.
Keep your eyes and ears open my Brothers and Sisters.  Orchendor needs us to keep vigilant while he convenes with Peryite in the Arcanex.
On the ninth of Rain's Hand our prayers went unanswered, yet here we stand, not faltering in our belief that soon you will show yourself to us.
Are you joking?
Now I suggest you turn around and go back the way you came.
Even if we had a prisoner by that name, the only way he'd be released is by order of the Imperial Legion.
Boo! Ahahahaha!
Surprise! Ahaha!
Oooooh... weeeeoooooo....
That's right. Who's invisible? Me!
But not my own!
Death? Oh, there's death to be found here, to be sure.
Can't catch me!
Tag! You're it!
I'm bored! Let's play a game!
Father says I shouldn't play with you anymore.
I'm not playing with you, Kayd! You play mean!
Aww, I'm hungry! Can we get some food, instead?
Check your map.
Here's where you need to go.
Damn the Jarls.
If it even exists.
And damn the Moot!
No, but this one...
They demand the Moot.
It'll be there. You'll see.
A crown doesn't make a king.
You're certain you've found it?
When have I ever been false with you?
Fine. I'll send the Unblooded here with you.
The Jarls are upset. They don't all support you.
All the more reason then. The crown would legitimize your claim.
The Jagged Crown! It heralds back to a time before jarls and moots.
Skyrim needs that king. You will be that king, Ulfric. You must be.
It exists. And it'll be the symbol of the righteousness of our cause. Think about it.
Fancy a crawl through a moldering dungeon to see if you can't stir up Galmar's Jagged Crown?
Tell me again why we're wasting time and dwindling resources chasing a legend. We don't even know it exists!
Back to the time when a king was a king because his enemies fell before him, and his people rose because they loved him.
We should risk letting those milkdrinkers put Thorryg's woman on the throne? She'll hand Skyrim over to the elves on a silver plate.
Did you really?
And he specifically mentioned the Staff of Magnus?
I... I'm impressed with your initiative. Of course, someone will need to follow up on this.
Do you have it?
Don't I always?
I should have guessed.
And... you'll take care of it?
Wait, let me guess. You'll get to it later.
You promised me you'd sweep the entranceway.
The corn stores are getting low again, Orgnar.
Well. There's something to be said for honesty, I suppose.
I don't suppose I could convince you to take care of it now, could I?
I still need you to make a batch of those fried potatoes. We can serve them with the ale.
You are going to brew a new batch of ale, right? Like we talked about? What we have's been sitting in that barrel for over a month.
Excellent work.
To return to its past glory, it must first drink the blood of deceit.
It has languished too long outside the winds of alliance and betrayal.
To return to its past glory, it must reacquaint itself with the hatred of this world.
Now, I trust you're sharp enough to see that the sword doesn't match the description of the Ebony Blade you may know.
Seek out those closest to you. The final pluck of their misguided heartstrings will accompany my blade in the song of your grandeur.
Your world is admirably seeped in lies and inclinations. My blade is a darling leech that feeds on deceptions, and nourishes its master.
The blade will feed on the ire of Tamriel. Bathe in your infamy. Feel the weight of their loathing, and my power will course through it once more.
Fine, go ahead.
Um, I don't know, why?
Okay, got another one for you.
I know! I know! Just shut up and let me look, okay?
What, seriously? Come on, I thought that was funny!
He didn't want to hit the bar like the rest! Ha ha ha!
Three guards run into a bar, but the fourth one just ducks. Why?
You'd better find that chest that fell off the boat or Gulum-Ei will have your hide!
Oh my... that's the worst one yet. How about we stop talking and keep our eyes open like Gulum-Ei said?
Fine. Let's go.
And my children?
It's time to leave.
Not without a fight it isn't!
Now. We really must be going, sir.
Come. You, too. We can escape through the tunnels.
As soon as we can muster our forces, we'll be back.
We've failed. The city is lost. They're through the gates and will be here soon.
That's the battle you need to fight. Not this. This will be suicide. And to what end?
I assume everyone's gone ahead of us as planned. I just swept through the castle, no one's here.
Go ahead, Ataf.
All right, let's try something a bit more... fun.
That was better Ataf. Add a bit of emphasis on [QUOTE]Ragnar[QUOTE] and [QUOTE]Red.[QUOTE]
Remember, it's your job to [QUOTE]deliver[QUOTE] these songs. To excite the crowd. Draw them in and they will love you for it.
Got ore to dig.
I'm just here to mine.
Gat and I are the only survivors.
Don't go to Kolskeggr. It's not safe.
Don't have much to say to you. Got work.
Kolskeggr, overrun with Forsworn, what next?
Thank Malacath we got out of Kolskeggr alive.
What if the Forsworn come here? We aren't safe.
I'm just here to dig. Not much else to talk about.
Have you met Torom? He's the best dog in the Reach.
Guess we'll have two more mouths to feed for a while.
I'm one of miners. Plenty of ore to dig up around here.
Don't have much to say unless you're here to mine metal.
I'm the hardest worker in Left Hand. Better than any man.
Kolskeggr Mine is lost, friend. Forsworn killed everyone.
You should speak with my husband. Skaggi runs everything.
Poor Pavo and Gat. To have lived through a Forsworn attack.
My Erith has her father's eyes. She's all I have left of him.
Damn Forsworn. Only a matter of time before they hit here, too.
It's amazing how much work goes into the little things, isn't it?
What'cha doing in Left Hand? Do you dig up rocks too, like my mom?
I'm in charge of Left Hand Mine. You cause trouble, you answer to me.
Most women would rather die than dig, but I have a daughter to raise.
Hope Pavo will be able to go back to his mine soon. Everyone needs a home.
Did you hear that? Pavo was driven out of his mine. Almost everyone is dead.
Don't know what I would have done without Pavo. Man's braver than he admits.
Left Hand Mine deals with iron, the perfect metal to dig with a war going on.
Why do they call it Left Hand Mine? Can the miners use their right hands too?
Pavo and I had to fight our way out of Kolskeggr. Forsworn killed everyone else.
Why is everyone so upset? If there's Forsworn, the Jarl will take care of them, right?
Another day, another settlement gets attacked. No place in the Reach is safe from the Forsworn.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
What gave it away?
Yeah, got to admit that little jester is good with that butter knife. But don't worry, I gave as good as I got.
Ha! I like you.
No man is a match for a dragon.
Buying one of our blades wouldn't hurt your chances, though.
Ha! So you did.
I'll explain on the way.
I was almost beginning to think Gavros had gone and gotten himself killed just to spite me.
Well, with the Falmer skulking around I can't very well do this on my own. I guess you'll have to come with me.
He he he he he.
Sure I did. And I'd do it again.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's my boy!
Ha! I knew it! Had your name written all over it, that one did!
Ha ha ha ha! Yeah, I sure did. It was one of my best pranks yet, father.
Ha! That ain't nothing. Wait till you see what I got planned for next week.
You just wait. My new pranks are going to the best ever! You'll see! He he he he.
Hey boy, I heard you nailed a Septim into Lucan's doorstep. Damn near drove him crazy. That true?
See, now that's what I'm talking about. Working hard, making your mark on this world. Good job, son.
Heard me a rumor, boy. Something about you putting bugs in the stew over at the Sleeping Giant. You do this?
Tell me, son. Any truth to these stories I been hearing. About you gluing a cow's udders shut? You really do something like that?
Help! Assassin!
Hey! Stop that.
Ah! Don't do that.
Hey! Don't do that.
Huh? Don't do that!
Ah Please! Don't hurt me!
Oh! What did you just do?
What the... Don't do that!
Stop it! I don't like magic.
Wow! That was fun. Do it again!
Hey! What are you trying to pull?
What was that? Don't do it again.
Ah! Keep your spells away from me.
Hey! I didn't ask you to magic me.
Keep your damn spells to yourself.
Whoa, whoa, whoa? What did you do?
Huh... what was that? What'd you do?
I did not ask for that! No more magic.
Don't try to magic me, you damn wizard.
Stop that! Keep your spells to yourself.
You there! That was uninvited. No more.
Ah! I'm just an old woman. Don't hurt me.
Wizards. There oughta be a law against them.
Ah! Damn wizard. Keep your spells off of me.
That was pathetic. It didn't even do anything.
Oh! I don't feel any different. What did you do?
Don't know what that was, but don't try it again.
Hey! What the... keep your damn magic to yourself.
Ah! Picking on an old man? What did I ever do to you?
Magic is for the weak. Pick up some steel if you want to fight me.
You stop that! I will not be violated by some... half-Septim magician!
How can I help?
Quickly, what is it?
Can't talk.... I'm outta' here.
I can't believe this is happening, lad.
I can't believe this is happening, lass.
How dare you bring that Dunmer bitch here.
The time for talk has passed. We must hurry.
We can talk after I find out what's going on.
They're waiting for you in the cistern. No tricks.
Hold your thoughts 'til after we untangle this mess.
Can't talk long, got to keep my eyes open for Mercer.
So it's true. You've turned traitor. I can't believe it.
What in blazes is going on? Are you working with Karliah?
Need to stay focused in case Frey comes back, make it fast.
They say that Karliah murdered Gallus, but I'm not so sure.
Vex better leave a piece of Mercer for us. It's payback time.
I hope he turns up soon... he needs to answer for his betrayal.
I can't believe he emptied the vault. Right from under our noses.
Just take a step back and let me figure this out. Then we'll talk.
Stabbed in the back. It's like the Dark Brotherhood all over again.
This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors. Now go away.
If I see Frey, I'll pluck his eyes from his skull with my bare hands!
I'm relieved Brynjolf has an open mind or that could have gotten bloody.
If I find Mercer first, I'm going to crush his skull with my bare hands!
I never saw this coming, I thought we were just having a run of bad luck.
If you don't have a good reason to be partnered with Karliah, you're dead.
I heard what happened and the Guild owes you thanks for bringing this to light.
Punishment's too good for Mercer Frey. The only penalty for his betrayal is death.
How can Karliah remain so calm when Mercer had her on the run for that long? Amazing.
I dare Mercer to come back here! He sets one foot in the cistern and I'll cut it off!
Vex is ready to tear you apart. I hope you have a good excuse for bringing Karliah here.
I won't rest until Mercer's dead. How could he murder Gallus and betray all of us like that?
Look at that dark elf whore... strutting around like she's innocent. I'll cut her open from gullet to groin!
There's no doubt Mercer will make for the borders of Skyrim. I hope you find him before he escapes our grasp.
How's business?
It's as bad as ever.
No, I... I was just asking.
I certainly do.
Since you went so far as seek out the Augur for advice, I thought you'd be more enthusiastic.
I... I'm sorry.
Nothing! I... it's ill fortune. That's all.
I don't know what your aunts told you, but...
Well, your ill fortune means I have no mother.
They're not my aunts. They're your aunts. And they told me enough.
About how the Divines cursed you. What horrible thing did you do to deserve it?
I'm afraid not.
No, dear sister. We do not.
Hmm. All right. Do you think... maybe we should?
Of course, Lucan. Of course. I was just, well... Never mind.
We don't sell any imports from Summerset Isle, do we, Lucan?
Okay, okay. Just trying make this place a little less... boring.
Lucan, we don't sell silver buckles, do we? One of the customers was asking.
I know, I know. My head's in the clouds again. Just... forget I said anything.
That's really not at the top of my list, no. Please, Camilla, I need you to focus.
Dear sister, we talked about this sort of thing before. We sell dry goods, nothing more, nothing less.
Hmmm... Well, maybe we could go on a sort of trip. Take the wares on the road. Get some new customers.
Camilla, really? You don't have better things to do? Because I could certainly find quite a few tasks...
A sale? To attract new customers? Camilla, everyone in Riverwood already shops here. There are no more customers.
Lucan, I was thinking we should have a grand sale. Lower the prices by half, maybe get some jugglers. We could attract lots of new customers.
Well, I was thinking... we should. We could stock all kinds of specialty items. You know, to cater to some of our more.... [QUOTE]eclectic[QUOTE] customers.
I'm so nervous.
Keep it together, Gianna. Keep it together...
The Emperor is going to love it. How can he not?
Maybe when this is all over, you could sign one of your cookbooks for me?
Oh, just look at you. Absolutely brilliant. Now... now you're just as I imagined.
Not another delivery. I told you people, our stocks are fine. Now put whatever you have over there, then get out!
We'll begin as soon as you're wearing the hat. Check the shelf over there. Wouldn't want the Emperor mistaking you for someone else, now would we.
Is that a joke?
Well, he is the mayor.
We've got a new order in.
No, it's fine. I don't mind being poor.
I suppose Kjeld asked for the usual discount?
No! Roggi and Kjeld need some more support timbers for the mine.
It shall be so.
Who will speak for her?
Who will speak for him?
And would you raise a mug in her name?
And would you raise a mug in his name?
Would you raise your shield in her defense?
Would you raise your shield in his defense?
And would you raise your sword in her honor?
And would you raise your sword in his honor?
Then the judgment of this Circle is complete.
It stands ready to meet the blood of her foes.
It stands ready to meet the blood of his foes.
I stand witness to the courage of the soul before us.
This man has endured, has challenged, and has shown his valor.
This woman has endured, has challenged, and has shown her valor.
I would stand at her back, that the world might never overtake us.
I would stand at his back, that the world might never overtake us.
I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in her stories.
I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in his stories.
Brothers and sisters of the Circle, today we welcome a new soul into our mortal fold.
Let it beat with ours, that the mountains may echo and our enemies may tremble at the call.
Her heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers.
His heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers.
Leave me alone.
What are you looking at?
I've got to get out of here!
You have no business here, so keep walking.
Look, I... I...
You're right. You're right. Feller might be nutters, might not. But fact is, he needs help. I turn him away, what kind of man am I, hmm?
Look, um... Thanks. And I'm sorry for my unneighborly reaction. If you talk to Cicero, you be sure and tell him I'll be down to help soon.
Lost, stranger?
Try and hit the far target.
Ready to practice some more?
Try and hit the left target.
Try and hit the right target.
Looking to practice, stranger?
Try and hit the middle target.
Let me know if you want to try again.
It's not often I get visitors out here. You lost, stranger?
Great job hitting those targets. You definitely surprised me with your speed and composure.
Make 'em bleed.
These two aren't a problem anymore.
No. I wouldn't.
Well, I've certainly heard worse things.
You were given a vision? Are you serious?
Vision? What vision are you talking about? Oh, no matter.
Almost the opposite. The College got rid of something... someone, that was too much trouble.
You should go into town and talk to an elf named Nelacar. He was involved in the whole mess.
If you want to know, ask Nelacar. He's staying at the Frozen Hearth. Knows the whole sad story.
Oh no, I'm not talking about that. I'm not being blamed for saying something out of place. Again.
There's an Altmer named Nelacar staying at the inn outside the College. You should ask him about it.
I think the man you want to talk to is Nelacar. He was exiled a few years ago, bad research. Still hangs around the Frozen Hearth.
Whatever. The person you probably want is Nelacar. He's in the Frozen Hearth. Be careful, he was exiled from the College for a reason.
Yes, I did. I shouldn't be the one to tell you about this. There's an Altmer named Nelacar in the Frozen Hearth. Believe me, he'll know.
No. No I can't.
I have enough to keep me busy. View it as a chance to hone your craft.
Not this again.
Has my son Sven asked to join the war?
If he does, tell him how bad the food is. And how dangerous it is.
Look old woman. If your boy wants to learn how to fight, we'll teach him. Now off with you.
Oh, forgive me.
Most who arrive here do so because they have heard of the College beforehand.
This is the College of Winterhold, a safe haven for mages in Skyrim. A place of wisdom and arcane knowledge.
Oh, never mind.
Why would I do that? There's work to be done here.
Why would they be looking at me? Are they upset about the service?
I was wondering, father. Maybe you should take a day off and head into town. I could watch the inn while you're away.
It'll do you good! Maybe you could visit Irgnir or Fruki on your way out? I've seen them looking at you when they come in for drinks....
Oh, yes please!
Oh, if you insist!
This drink's on me.
Can I buy you a drink, darling?
You can buy me whatever you want!
So, um, mind if I buy you a drink?
Aw, that's so sweet of you! Thanks!
Not if you were the last man in the Empire.
Being friends with the bartender's son has its advantages, huh?
Oh! You got me!
Ha! You caught me!
Okay. Now what?
Really? Oh, I use Nirnroot as a special seasoning all the time as well. What a wonderful idea.
Out of the way!
Good fight going, here.
Look at the young ones scrap!
Could you move? You're in the way.
Not now, I'm trying to watch this!
Are you going to let me watch, or not?
Hope they don't get carried away here.
Pay attention, you could learn something.
Twelve septims on the girl! Look at that speed.
Don't mind them. Just working out some issues, in the old way.
I just try to keep out of the way when they start roughhousing.
Little blood to clear the air. Hope you have the stomach for it, outsider.
So where is it?
Did you mark it?
No, I don't need to mark it. I remember it.
You can tell it because it has lots of ebony.
I found a big load of ebony at the bottom pocket in the mine.
So, is it true?
I heard about what happened...
But to be outnumbered twenty to one...
Tell me, sister. Are the stories true?
Tell me, brother. Are the stories true?
Word certainly travels fast, doesn't it?
You must be talking about the caravan job...
Tell me, husband. Is it true what I've heard?
You're referring to that blacksmith contract?
Ah, you must mean my little adventure on the ship...
Your latest exploit certainly has the Sanctuary talking...
Unscrupulous daring. It's why you fell in love with me, my dear.
Sometimes I just need to remind everyone why I'm the one in charge.
Come now. What everyone else is saying. It can't possibly be true...
It's the part with the severed head I find most impressive. My compliments.
Come now, dear husband. You above all people should know what I'm capable of.
He he. Don't forget that I am Shadowscale. I was, quite literally, born to kill.
The temple contract? Well, I certainly won't deny my involvement. He he he he he.
It was a suicide mission! Astrid said as much. Yet here you stand, hale and hearty.
Let that be a lesson to you young pups. There is no challenge that magic cannot overcome.
I'm just trying to imagine you hiding inside the body of a mammoth. Bloody brilliant idea.
To kill triplets, secretly, and then have the whole thing blamed on the mother. Remarkable.
Ah, contracts like that are few and far between, it seems. Makes me long for the old days...
The Redoran contract? Yes, you heard correctly. In and out of Vvardenfell in less than forty eight hours.
Well, I just did what had to be done. Nothing more. Nothing less. I'm just glad I lived to tell the tale.
But really. A horker, some twine, three wood elves, and a hatchet? Points for creativity, if nothing else.
I am but a humble instrument of Sithis. Our Dread Father guides me. Therefore, failure is an impossibility.
Romantic, isn't? Like that time we first met. Remember that? Never seen so much blood. Ah, to be young again...
Oh, you mean in that manor house? During the thunderstorm? Heh. What can I say? It happened, just like you heard.
Hmph. Been awhile since I've actually cleaved someone in two. Forgot how hard it was to get the scimitar back out.
In truth? It was so easy, I feel a bit guilty. Once again, the sweet, innocent child earned more trust than was wise.
Once again, you have underestimated me. You see the man, brutish and hulking. But I am wolf as well. Deliberate. Cunning.
It was a simple matter, really, when one has mastered the art of camouflage. Scale becomes stone, becomes shadow. Then... death.
When I am become wolf, I am treachery incarnate. And then, then... there is no one who can stand between the hunter and his prey.
Yeah, well, don't expect many more stories like that in my future. I'm getting old. Being that amazing takes too much damn effort.
Bah! A child could have accomplished it. Such is the power of the arcane. If you only knew of the spells I didn't use. He he he he he.
Astrid, I've been hearing some, er... interesting things, from the others... about what you did when you left the Sanctuary last week...
You give me too much credit. For how could I fail? I am, after all, just a little girl. What threat could I possibly pose? He he he he he.
My greatest challenge was deciding which weapon to use, for I am prone to indecision. Bow, dagger... axe? In the end, I opted for my claws.
In the end, I relied on a woman's natural weapons - beauty and seduction. The rest was a formality. Though, a rather wet, messy formality...
You infiltrated the position, eliminated the target, and made it look like an accident. Impressive. I'd say you earned your bonus on that one!
I am the perfect weapon. My innocent, childish form grants me nearly unrestricted access. Poison or a good bite usually takes care of the rest.
By Sithis, you slew everyone! Well, except for that one you kept alive, to serve as witness. Does your wickedness, or your skill, know no bounds?
I guess I got tired of handing out contracts to everyone else, while I stayed home playing den mother. It was good to get out, and have some fun.
When one can divine the future, success may not be assured... but it can at least be anticipated. It helps that I've already foretold my own death.
What? You think me too old, too feeble? There is more knowledge in me than in two of you pups put together. And knowledge... knowledge is my weapon.
I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself. But more importantly, I made this Sanctuary some much needed gold. In the end, that's all that matters.
It's all thanks to a special technique I developed. I call it the [QUOTE]Razor-Winged Butterfly.[QUOTE] I'd teach it to you... but then I'd have to kill you.
When I first received the blessing of the wolf, my creator gave me a valuable piece of advice. [QUOTE]Arnbjorn,[QUOTE] he said. [QUOTE]Never lose![QUOTE] And I never do.
Sure, whatever.
Maybe. I'll see if I feel like it.
Father, could you clean up the house a little while I'm away?
I'm on my feet all day. Can you please do this one thing for me?
Thanks, Grelka!
Did you do everything I said, Shadr?
Hey, I told you not to ask any questions. Now, here. For your trouble.
The package was heavy... I needed his help getting it on his horse. What was inside?
Yes. The man came by at noon just like you said. I gave him the package and he gave me this pouch for you.
That is enough.
No, I don't think that will be necessary.
The College is not the only place to learn about magic.
When I grow up, will I go to the College in Winterhold?
But you went there, didn't you? Isn't that where you learned?
But I'm learning about magic, and that's what they do there. Shouldn't I go?
I was there only for a short time. Much of what I have learned has been on my own. And I will teach you. You have no reason to go there.
That's too bad.
The Words wait.
Use Clear Skies to open the way to Paarthurnax.
Then I'll wait.
This is it men!
Rrrrraaaaaarrrrr!!!!!
That message is this.
For Whiterun! For the Empire!
Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
Rrrrrraaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!
We are the sons and daughters of Skyrim!
Everyone, on me! The Jarl wishes to speak!
They'll have set barricades to slow us down.
This is it men! It's time to make this city ours!
The citizens of Whiterun are forever in your debt!
Carry on men, my gratitude and blessings go with you!
He will continue to sow discord and chaos wherever he can.
All right men. On me! For the Emperor! For his Legionnaires!
Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion!
Everyone on me. Let's show these Imperials what we're made of!
Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the sons and daughters of Skyrim!
The faster we take them out, the faster we can claim this city as ours!
Revel in your victory here today, even as the gods revel in your honor!
They'll have barricades set, destroy them quickly. Keep pressing forward.
We now fight our way to Castle Dour to cut the head off the legion itself!
All right. It's time to deliver the final blow to the Stormcloak rebellion.
Destroy them quickly, and take out the archers in the towers along the way.
You have all fought bravely, and sacrificed much to bring us to this point.
But make no mistake. What we do here today, we do for Skyrim and her people.
What we do here today, we do for our country! For all the true Nords of Skyrim!
Everyone on me. Let's show these Imperial milk drinkers what true Nords look like!
This is an important day for the Empire and for the Legion. And for all of Skyrim.
By cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country whole again!
Beyond that are two exterior gates. Find a way to open them and we can take this city!
And on that day, we will confiscate his city, and restore the rule of law to his lands.
They've barricades to block us, but we'll tear through them and the rebels behind them!
Lest our honor be lessened should we allow these bloodthirsty beasts to prowl our lands!
Our objective is the drawbridge. If we can find a way to drop it, the city will be ours!
They've barricades to block us, but we'll tear through them and the Imperials behind them!
This is the day we send a message to Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him.
Any king who denies the Emperor will wake one morning to face the Legion staring down his gates.
They say that our cause is false and that we are nothing more than thieves, thugs and murderers!
Whiterun's walls are tall, but they are old and crumbling, like the Empire whose Legion lines them.
All that remains then is the exterior gate. Find a way through to open it and the city will be ours!
The approach to Riften is guarded by watchtowers. They will be full of archers. Move fast, and stay low.
They already sing of your valor and skill! The halls of Sovngarde are no doubt ringing with your praises!
The walls of Markarth may be high, but their age will have created weakness or secret entrances. Find them!
Because this is the end for them, the Stormcloaks will fight like cornered rats. They will be fierce and crafty.
But no! We are farmers! We are craftsmen! We are sons and daughters of shopkeepers, maid servants and soldiers!
And so, we must each one of us, continue to fight this insurrection, lest our fallen brothers have died for naught!
In defeating these Stormcloak traitors, you have proven the hollowness of their cause and the fullness of your hearts.
The only way into Windhelm is across this bridge. Keep moving, stay close, and we'll be through their gates in no time.
But Ulfric will not stop here. No, he will continue to strike out against any true Nord who remains faithful to the Empire.
The Emperor will be paying close attention to what happens here today. Men who distinguish themselves will be well rewarded.
And we have come this far because our cause is true. Because we fight as one. And because our hearts are bursting with anger!
Fear neither pain, nor darkness. For Sovngarde awaits those who die with weapons in their hands, and courage in their hearts.
And in that moment, the gods will look down and see Skyrim as she was meant to be. Full of Nords who are mighty, powerful, and free!
Ulfric thinks he can hide behind the walls of his castle. But we will fight our way in and drag him out through the rubble to face justice.
On this day, our enemy will know the fullness of our determination, the true depth of our anger, and the exalted righteousness of our cause.
The gods are watching. The spirits of our ancestors are stirring. And men under suns yet to dawn will be transformed by what we do here today.
But they are no match for Legionnaires. You are the best and the brightest warriors in Tamriel. Professional soldiers, fearless and devastating.
We come to this moment carried by the sacrifices and courage of our fellows. Those who have fallen. And those still bearing the shields to our right.
Those bastards.
Help will arrive soon.
Agreed, we can't afford to try again.
It's been forever since I've eaten so well.
And it shows, I've seen horkers with smaller guts.
Would you two shut up before Brurid hears you messing around.
I return from the war to find my home overrun with bandit filth.
Funny coming from a woman who's breath smells like she just kissed a draugr.
Try not to die.
When you kill that Ice Wraith, then we'll talk about you becoming a Stormcloak.
Here. Take this. You'll need it. Use it on the island. Don't lose it. That's all the help you're getting.
Uh, yes. Quite.
Um, good. We reward loyalty, you know.
Ah, Nana Ildene, whatever would my family do without you?
Ah, Thonar, don't you worry. Nana Ildene isn't going anywhere.
Oh, I know, Thonar. Only a mad woman would ever betray the Silver-Blood family.
Very well then.
We're with you.
Lead on, we're ready.
We're right behind you.
Will do. Don't stray too far away or else we'll come after you.
No problem, but if you get too far away, we're going to catch up.
All right, but don't wander ahead too far or else we'll be forced to come find you.
Welcome to you.
A peaceful greeting to you.
The road makes this one weary.
Do you seek to make a purchase?
This Khajiit guards the others.
Fortune smiles upon this meeting.
Welcome to Khajiit's humble camp.
A welcome to you, fellow traveler.
Please, come and browse our goods.
May the sun warm your path, friend.
There is much beauty in this place.
Khajiit has wares, if you have coin.
You honor Khajiit with your presence.
How high the mountains of Skyrim rise!
Khajiit is ready for any troublemakers.
Come and see what is for sale, traveler.
Khajiit welcomes you, and also your coin.
May your bed be warm and your food sweet.
The roads of Skyrim lead to many dangers.
The wind blows bitter cold in this place.
Blessings of the moons upon you, traveler.
Many fine things are here for you, friend.
Bring your coins, but do not bring trouble.
I welcome you, friend. How may I serve you?
There is no trust for Khajiit in this place.
The warm sand of Elsweyr is far away from here.
Warm sands, friend. How may this one serve you?
I have traveled far across Tamriel to serve you.
Khajiit is just a guard, and has no wares to sell.
The air is so clear in Skyrim, one can see forever.
If you have come to see our wares, speak to the others.
Khajiit is always watching for thieves and pickpockets.
Speak to one of the others if you wish to buy something.
We are creatures of the desert. The north wind chills us to the bones.
It is a strange sight, the white flakes that sometimes fall from the sky.
The longer we travel the roads of Skyrim, the more empty this land seems.
Khajiit are not welcome in the cities, so we make our camps outside the walls.
Some come to buy, but others come to steal. Khajiit shows no mercy to thieves.
Welcome. If I cannot serve you, I am sure that one of my other traders can do so.
Perhaps you have encountered Ma'dran or Akhari? Both are sworn to me, and both have worthy goods to offer.
So many refuse to talk to us. They call us thieves and smugglers. I am glad to see that you are not such a one.
Welcome, child.
It's a shame, isn't it?
I can almost hear its heart.
It's like it was in my dreams.
Do you have the Eldergleam sap?
Is it much further to the sanctuary?
I can't believe I've finally made it here.
Please move quickly. Eldergleam awaits us.
What's happened to the Gildergreen is a travesty.
So, have you gotten Nettlebane back from those filthy Hagravens yet?
Well, hurry up.
What about him?
What is it now?
Fastred, I wanted to talk with you.
Well it stops now, and that's final!
I know what you said, but I only wanted to speak to him for a moment.
Wilhelm said he saw you speaking to one of the pilgrims on the 7,000 Steps. I told you that I didn't want you to go up there.
Yes, Dean Inge.
Now, you try it Aia
Let's try a lute piece. Follow along...
Very good, Aia. Class, observe her finger movements. Let's try a few more pieces.
Yes, very good.
Here, then, is the first of the Illusion spells you sought.
Yes, yes it is.
You have a problem with that?
Look, either you get the notes or I'll figure out another way to do it. Just come find me if you can get your hands on them.
You found what?
Hmm. Well now. This is all very fascinating, but I don't recall asking to you to touch anything in here.
I suppose you'd better show that to Tolfdir nonetheless. And please, ask before tampering with anything else.
Hmm. Well now. Yes, this might actually be something interesting. You'd better show that to Tolfdir right away.
You. Over here!
No. Not again. Help!
That's it. Keep hacking at it.
It's coming loose. I can feel it.
Just shut it and keep an eye out for trouble.
I know I ran ahead with the claw, but I need help!
You fool, why should I share the treasure with anyone?
Is... is someone coming? Is that you Harknir? Bjorn? Soling?
What if Arvel doesn't come back? I want my share from that claw!
So we're just supposed to sit here while Arvel runs off with that golden claw?
That dark elf wants to go on ahead, let him. Better than us risking our necks.
You're welcome.
A fatal mistake!
The shadows have failed you!
A word, my love?
What troubles you, darling?
Nonsense, dear. I've had more visitors than ever seeking the wisdom of the hearth goddesses.
Ah, that must be it. So many of the men are serving in battle. I shall pray to Stendarr that they return victorious.
I fear attendance is down. There are so few worshippers coming to see us. Could it be that the war has weakened their faith?
Ah, you're back.
Aiiiiiiiieeeeee!
All right, dear.
That's all right, grandmother. I like staying home with you.
Lars, dear, why don't you go outside and play? It's a beautiful day.
No! Please, grandmother, don't do that. I'm fine. Really. Can we just... not talk about this anymore?
It's that Braith girl again, isn't it? Has she been bothering you again? I've a mind to speak with her mother.
All right, then.
I noticed a trail of blood leading away from here.
Helgird's taken the body into the Hall of the Dead to prepare for burial. She's a little crazy, but if she knows anything, it's dead bodies.
And Mercer Frey?
The Key! You have the Skeleton Key! I never thought I'd see it again.
And who is this?
It is no matter, this fool will be the next act of the show.
Aren't they all?
I'm sure you're right.
Looks to be another cold day.
Not like this. Feels colder than usual. Bet it's those damned Mages.
Ayarg garag gar!
no subtitles - indecipherable giant combat barks
Bloody tourists.
Come on, get up!
I grant you a new life!
Rise up and live again!
This should work. I've done it before.
Gah! This staff is useless... I'm useless. The whole world is useless!
Come, follow me.
Congratulations!
Glory to the Arch-Mage!
Long live the Arch-Mage!
Hooray for the Arch-Mage!
Well done, well done indeed!
Members of the College -- your new Arch-Mage!
Congratulations.
I'm promoting you to Quaestor.
Here. I want you to have this. Don't ask. Just take it.
Please take this on behalf of all the brothers and sisters.
Found this among the dead. Something tells me I should give it to you.
Here, take this gift as a sign of the Empire's appreciation, and my own.
On behalf of the Empire, and myself, please accept this gift along with your new rank.
We'll call you Ice-Veins now, for the thick blood of our land has seeped into your heart.
Here, take this. It's an Imperial officer's sword. A fitting weapon to use against our enemy.
We will oust Ulfric from Windhelm soon enough. And when we do, I'll have his head on a plate.
Now that we have Winterhold, I can garrison some troops there until I'm ready to march on Windhelm.
Battles are won by trained and disciplined men. Wars are won by talented and exceptional individuals.
You've become a true hero of Skyrim. I number you among my kin. You shall now be known as Stormblade.
I'm raising you to Praefect. Take this blade, as a gift and symbol of your new rank. You've earned it.
We found this in the Jarl's treasury after we captured the city. I thought you should be the one to have it.
I'm glad we've finally restored the Pale. It was extremely foolish giving the Empire control of another port.
Losing the Rift gives Tullius easy access to the south of Eastmarch. Talos preserve us. We must take it back!
The love of the land and her people flows from your heart, even as death to her enemies flows from your hands.
We found this in the Jarl's treasury after we captured the capital. I thought you should be the one to have it.
Taking control of the Rift was a great victory. Ulfric must be rather nervous with us so close to his door step.
We do what we do out of love for our brothers and sisters. Here, take this as a token of such love reciprocated.
You've come a long way. I don't think we could do without you. I'm hereby raising you to Tribune. Congratulations.
By taking back Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. We should never have given it up.
I'm glad we liberated the Rift. It was dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.
We need the Rift. We need to regain control of it before we can march on Windhelm without worry about our rear guard.
You show great passion for battle, and compassion for those we fight for. You are becoming indispensable to our cause.
I can't believe we lost Whiterun. The rebels have a great advantage in controlling the center now. We must take it back!
The Imperials have really dug into Whiterun. We'll wrest it from them soon enough. We must. Its central position is key.
I've come to rely on you. There's something I want you to have. It was my father's. It would be my honor if you carried it.
But I'm disappointed to hear you ran away from the battle. The gods do not reward cowardice. Nor do I. I expect better from you.
Damn Tullius. He's pocketed men in the Rift. It's dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.
Hjaalmarch is an important buffer zone between the rebel forces and the capital. Ulfric will try to break through at some point.
We should take Hjaalmarch. It'll be an important pressure point on the Imperials. We'd be within spitting distance of the capital.
Now that the Empire has been driven from the Reach we can put a stop to the raping of her silver mines. That silver belongs in Skyrim.
Ulfric will want to take Whiterun from us. But we will hold fast. We can't give the rebellion free reign through the center of Skyrim.
It was important we reclaimed the Reach. Letting Ulfric control the flow of silver was a mistake. One I'm glad we've finally corrected.
Multitudes of our enemies are buried in an avalanche of pain and retribution delivered by your hands. I shall call you Snow-Hammer now.
I'm glad we've taken back Winterhold. While the Imperials were up there, important resources were tied up stiffening our northern border.
Tullius must be getting nervous. Taking Hjaalmarch we're practically in his backyard now. As soon as we're able, we'll march on Solitude.
I don't like Imperial troops holed up in Winterhold... such a close march to Windhelm. So I'm sending a campaign up there to take it back.
I have come to rely heavily upon you. It is only fitting that you join the upper echelon. I am hereby elevating you to the rank of Legate.
By holding onto Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. Ulfric will try for it soon. We'll be there to stop him.
However, I'm disappointed to hear that you fled from the field of battle. We do not reward cowardice in the Legion. I expect better of you.
I'm losing my patience with this damn war. We must take Hjaalmarch back! The Stormcloaks will be beating upon the doors of the capital soon.
We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good. We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep.
The Empire's ravenous hunger for Skyrim's silver makes them fierce. But rest assured, we'll win the Reach and wrest it from their greedy paws.
I'm proud we liberated Falkreath from the Empire. In many ways it's the heart and soul of Skyrim. Not to mention its rather strategic position.
Take this blade, a symbol of your new station and responsibility. I'll keep an eye on your progress. The Empire rewards excellence, and so do I.
I almost can't believe it's over. The rebellion is squashed, Windhelm is free. I must admit, Ulfric put up a stronger fight than I was expecting.
It's good we hold the Reach. Were the rebels to gain control, the silver mines would give them coin to hire more thugs and expand their violence.
On behalf of the sons and daughters of Skyrim, on behalf of all that is righteous and true, take this token of our appreciation for your service.
Some brothers have taken to calling you Bone-Breaker, evidence of your ferocity and determination. A fitting name. So we shall all call you thus.
Soon enough we will march on Solitude. And on that day the heroes of Sovngarde will march with us, and the Empire will fall to its knees in fear.
Tullius has camps in the Pale, entertaining thoughts of battle. The Empire still underestimates the force of our cause. It will be their undoing.
We need to stem the flow of silver to the rebellion. Until we retake the Reach, the Stormcloaks will plunder it's mines to fund further violence.
I fear losing Falkreath may give too much advantage to Ulfric. The rebels now control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. I want it back.
The war demands so much from us, and we give all we have to it and to the people... but I've kept a little something to offer you in appreciation.
Controlling the Pale gives Ulfric a port town and takes the pressure off of Windhelm. But it's only a matter of time before it's back in our hands.
I almost can't believe it. The Empire has been defeated. The world bears witness to the power and righteousness of the sons and daughters of Skyrim.
I can't believe we let them take the Pale. Losing the port of Dawnstar is lessened only by the threat of Imperial forces being so close to Windhelm.
I'm not sure why Tullius is wasting his time trying to take Winterhold from us. But if he wants to throw his men away, I'll gladly accept that gift.
The Empire thinks it holds Falkreath from us. But the souls of Skyrim's bravest are buried there and will fill our hearts and strengthen our blades.
There's not much up there, but if we can regain Winterhold, our proximity to Windhelm should keep Ulfric wary and wasting troops garrisoned at home.
And I need capable and loyal warriors close at hand. So I'd like to offer you a home in Windhelm. Speak with my steward who'll make the arrangements.
Reclaiming Hjaalmarch lets me worry less about the rear guard, and push more men to the front. It was a mistake to let Ulfric control it for so long.
Taking the Pale gives us another port in Dawnstar, and puts us within striking distance of Windhelm. That should make Ulfric a bit more cautious, eh?
Didn't you know?
Others returned home after the Red Year, when Vvardenfell erupted and caused much destruction.
Before the Oblivion Crisis, many elves called Winterhold their home. More visited the College from Morrowind every year.
Winterhold itself died in the years between then and now. What's left out there is a husk. Only the College really remains.
After, growing distrust of magic made life difficult for many. Some left rather than endure the growing hatred from the local Nords.
Get out of here!
This is my treasure!
I'm not kidding. I'll hurt you!
Get to it, then.
Try not to get carried away.
Go. Bring honor to yourself, and the Companions.
Go on. Get lost.
Get on your way before I change my mind.
Great, let's go!
Good! I've got a few scores to settle.
Here's your cut.
That's the first bit of good news I've had since I set sail a year ago.
Hmm? What about?
Papa, I want to talk to you...
Well, there's this boy, and...
Listen, Braith... Why don't you talk to your mother about this, okay? There's a good girl.
I wish your mother were still alive. She could answer you much better. Let me think on it and we'll talk later.
How do you feel?
Feeling any better?
How are you feeling?
Has your fever cooled?
More rest will do you good.
How is the pain? Any better?
Patience. The body needs time to mend.
Try to relax. You'll be well soon enough.
I appreciate it.
I have a choice?
I should say so.
You've got some nerve.
Next time think before you speak.
I'm on it, lass.
Damn you, Mercer!
Wait a moment... what's that?
I'm sorry lass, I... I can't...
Damn it! There's no way through.
It's Mercer! Look... down there!
You can't kill what you can't see!
Aye, lass. Nothing's getting by me.
We'll have to find another way around.
Hmm. The gate below still looks closed.
Shor's Bones! Look at that monstrosity.
Aye, lass... and we'll be ready for him.
The stench... this place reeks of Falmer.
Climb down that ledge and see if you can...
He's toying with us. He wants us to follow.
Aye. Whatever you want to do, we're with you.
I should've finished you when I had the chance!
Fight it, Brynjolf... he's taken control of you!
Mercer was able to knock this thing down? Gods...
What's... what's happening... I can't stop myself.
Come, [QUOTE]Nightingale![QUOTE] Find me if you can!
It's a Dwarven Centurion. Very tough and very deadly.
So this is what we heard. The entire tower collapsed.
Karliah's taught you nothing! Your lessons begin anew!
This is where we saw Mercer. We must be getting close.
I've mastered the shadows... and now your life is mine!
He's close. I'm certain of it. We must prepare ourselves.
Then this is it. We do this for Gallus and for the Guild.
Karliah, when will you learn you can't get the drop on me?
Falmer patrol up ahead. I don't think they know we're here.
He's here and he hasn't seen us yet. Brynjolf, watch the door.
Can't say that I have. Imagine the riches hidden within these walls.
I'll bet my last septim that there's a mechanism around here somewhere.
Get the damn Key and let's get out of here before we end up like Mercer!
I can hear water rushing through these pipes. We must be beneath a lake.
The only reason to do that would be to block pursuit. It must be Mercer.
We have to find another way out of here before the place fills with water!
It's the Key, Brynjolf. In his hands, there's no telling what he's capable of.
Looks like we can take the low road or the high road across this chamber. Your choice.
We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lad. We're right behind you.
Look at the size of this place. Have you ever seen anything like it in your life, lass?
We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lass. We're right behind you.
Mercer must have triggered these pistons. We're going to have to search for a way to open them.
This must be their hive. We'll have to keep silent if we want to avoid drawing their attention.
Damn! This place is coming down! Quick, get the Skeleton Key and the Eye and lets get out of here!
No luck there, lass. Something must have fallen on the other side of the door because it isn't moving!
Even the Falmer don't deserve the pain these implements must have inflicted. The dwarves were a cruel race.
There's a mass of the Falmer in this chamber. We can sneak through or take them down... I don't care. As long as we get to Mercer.
I've seen a puzzle like this before... there's got to be another lever to pull, but you'd better hurry. A septim says this mechanism's on a timer.
Karliah, I'll deal with you after I rid myself of your irksome companions. In the meantime, perhaps you and Brynjolf should get better acquainted.
I'm sorry, what?
Well... I'd certainly love to have such a powerful staff, but I'm not really sure that any of us need it.
Is dinner ready?
Praise to Namira!
The feast has begun!
I love this part of the meal.
I can smell the blood. Good and sour.
Just not by you.
He's dangerous. Very dangerous. A rogue Dark Elf mage doing research into Dwarven artifacts should be both respected... and feared.
Let me see that!
Yes... yes. This is it! I don't know how you found this stranger, but you've obviously succeeded where I had failed.
Please, let me offer you this key. It unlocks my strongbox under my stand in the marketplace. Help yourself to anything inside.
Mara be praised!
Nightcaller Temple is only a short walk from Dawnstar. Come, we must hurry.
Most impressive.
When that time comes, you shall take his place as my emissary. What say you?
Indeed. Speak with me when the box has been opened, and all shall be revealed.
Once that infernal lockbox is opened, he will have exhausted his usefulness to me.
Be warned. Many have thought as you do. I have broken them all. You shall not evade me forever.
I am Hermaeus Mora. I am the guardian of the unseen, and knower of the unknown. I have been watching you, mortal.
Your continuing aid to Septimus renders him increasingly obsolete. He has served me well, but his time is nearing its end.
Move along, now.
He he. That'll teach the little loony.
Damn that Loreius. Oh, how he will pay for this treachery...
A jester. In these parts. Man must be completely off his tree.
Oh thank you, kind stranger. Thank you for helping Cicero and his poor, stranded mother.
You just keep quiet and stay where you are. Soon as my relief arrives, we'll all take a nice little trip.
You there! Fool! Hold fast. You've been accused of a crime against the laws of this land. What say you in your defense?
You look like a crazy man to me. And what's in that coffin, hmm? Maybe some time in a cell will help loosen that lying tongue.
Wh... What? A crime? Me? Preposterous! Poor Cicero is just standing here! Cicero loves order. Oh yes! He would never disrespect the law!
New to Markarth?
For the Forsworn!
Hmph. Yes, Nepos.
Just here to work.
I'm shopping. Excuse me.
You heard him. Go on in.
He was after Margret. Why?
Be careful who you talk to.
Keep your eyes and ears open.
What? By the gods, Betrid....
Need to get going. What is it?
This has ruined my entire day.
Traitors. Traitors all of you!
What's happening to this city?
Damn. Another body to get rid of.
The Forsworn. Here inside the city.
Why? We had a deal Madanach. A deal!
I should never have come to Markarth.
Looks like you weren't followed. Good.
Oh it's you. The one from the market.
Wait. It's okay, my dear. Send her in.
Wait. It's okay, my dear. Send him in.
I'm sorry, but you're not leaving alive.
I work for the Silver-Bloods. Help clean.
Let me know as soon as you've found anything.
I hope your stay in Markarth treats you better.
Betrid. No! We had a deal you Forsworn bastards!
I'm sorry, I'm still a bit dizzy from everything.
City's got eyes. Be careful when you're out there.
Once you've found out anything, come straight to me.
I'm sorry. We're only interested in helping our patrons.
You want answers? Well so do I. So does everyone in this city.
Oh, I think you dropped this. Some kind of note. Looks important.
Ah, yes. You've proven to be a real bloodhound. Well, you've sniffed me out.
The Treasury House is really just for patrons of the Silver-Blood family. You don't belong here.
A man goes crazy in the market. Everyone knows he's a Forsworn agent. Guards do nothing. Nothing but clean up the mess.
I've been playing this game for almost 20 years. Sending the young to their deaths. All in the name of the Forsworn. And I'm tired. So tired.
Not lately. Why?
There is a Thieves Guild in town you know.
Grelka, have you had anyone come by and try to sell you an iron war axe?
Well, we had one go missing from the Pawned Prawn, and I was just wondering...
Oh I get it. [QUOTE]It's missing so Grelka must have it.[QUOTE] I wish this town would stop pointing their fingers at me.
Oh, why is that?
Oh. What's this?
I expect a great deal of excitement in the city of Whiterun in the near future...
Ahhh... You're quite brave to carry such a message. It's a pity you've chosen the wrong side...
You can return this axe to the man who sent it. And tell him he should prepare to entertain... visitors.
Okay. You're it!
Out of my sight!
No... I was trying to...
What? You've been lollygagging in idle reading?
I know, master. Don't say such things -- there is always time.
Don't be so sure. Now, have you finished grinding the dried snowberries?
Erm... no. Not yet. I'm sorry, I was reading up on the effects of distillation.
I'm sorry to always be so hard on you, boy. I just worry I don't have much time left.
Reeaaaallllyyyy?
Actually... I do. Little joke.
But seriously. What's the message?
Well? Spit it out, mortal. I haven't got an eternity!
Ooh, ooh, what kind of message? A song? A summons? Wait, I know! A death threat written on the back of an Argonian concubine! Those are my favorite.
Reyda! Reyyyyda!
Be careful up there.
Have yourself a great day!
A pleasant journey, milady.
A pleasant journey, milord.
I wish I could go with you...
Thanks again for the legwork.
Sure, leave. Everyone else does.
Hmph. What a boring conversation.
Narfi so happy! So happy! So happy!
Welp, time to gather more supplies I guess.
Just get out of my way, I've got work to do.
The mountain will eat you! Watch the mountain!
If you pass through again, stop by for a drink.
Now go give those stupid bears what's coming to them!
If you get a chance, kill a few more bears for me, will you?
Keep your eyes open in the barrow... that's how they get you!
Just get out of town as fast as you can. Nothing for anyone here.
If you're headed up to the monastery, watch your step... it's a long way down.
If you see Reyda, tell her that Narfi misses her and to come home soon... very soon. Soon... soon, like the moon!
Right away, sir!
Move it. Get to work. Get to work!
Always another big meal to cook. Figures.
Filthy natives. Get to work. We have meals to prepare and no time to prepare them!
See that you do.
Err, excuse me Enthir. Might I have a moment?
And that, my nervous little friend, has not happened. Would you care to comment on that, perhaps?
Yes, err, apologies for the intrusion. I was wondering, err, if you could possibly, ah, procure a few select items for me.
Ahh, hmm. Yes. I, err, I was unaware that I had forgotten that. I will, err, I mean I'll take care of that as soon as possible.
Really, Arniel? Because I seem to recall doing just that for you recently, at which point you assured me that you'd cover my expenses.
Should've known.
Not that it matters anymore. No one bothers coming to Winterhold for any other reason.
Thanks! I'm out!
The other chief!
Which other one?
There's only one chief!
What about the other one?
But I thought there was only one chief.
Well, right. One of us will be a chief.
How much longer do we have to work this backwoods mine?
A bit longer, yet. We need more money if we want to be chiefs of our own.
There! Now, I...
There! All better.
Let me try again...
Oh my. That isn't right!
Oh no, that's not it at all.
Okay, now don't move at all.
Just wait. Just... I can fix this.
Please hold still, and don't move.
This will only take me a moment...
I'll get it right this time, I swear.
Oh dear. That wasn't supposed to happen.
This really isn't turning out the way I'd hoped.
I still need some help, if you can spare the time.
You have to hold still or this isn't going to work.
If you have a moment, could you help me with something?
Do you... do you feel all right? You look very, umm, green.
This is a shame.
Another one. Terrible.
Always sad when someone has to die.
Large diagonal cut from left shoulder...
Tread carefully.
Oh, it's ancient. Apparently one of the first Sanctuaries in Skyrim. It hasn't been used by the Brotherhood in close to a hundred years.
If you say Cicero has gone there, it stands to reason that he's familiar with the place. That means you'll be fighting him on his own ground.
Understood, sir.
Sir, these are missing commands for about half of the commanders.
New orders for the soldiers, Legate. Make sure they're distributed as noted.
That is correct. Those orders have been delivered by special courier. I can't trust some of our normal distribution channels.
Well? In you go.
What about them?
They're miners. Harmless.
Father, I'm worried about Gadba and Mul.
I've just learned not to trust luck around here.
You don't worry about two Orc men coming into your stronghold? That they might challenge you?
What do you say?
If you're interested, I could point out a good place that could use a little housecleaning.
Just got a tip on this house... should be stuffed with loot. Care to head over there and find out?
These people just inherited some heirlooms from a relative. Good timing for us, bad timing for them, eh?
One of the quickest ways to make some coin in Skyrim is to clear out some of the wealthier homes of their valuables.
Got a message from one of my people that this place just came into some coin. Should be a good target. Want to take it?
I think we have a nice wealthy home for you to break into. Think you can clear the place of valuables and keep it quiet?
Good timing. The people in this home recently got one of your fellow Guild mates sent to jail. How about you make them pay for it.
The owner of this place just got an inheritance from a relative lost in the war. Sound like something you can sink your teeth into?
Someone with connections to our Guild wants us to hit this place and send a message by clearing it of valuables. You want to handle it?
You can give this house a once over. I hear they're fairly well-off and probably have lots of good stuff ripe for the picking. Sound good?
What's this now?
By Azura. The Gourmet!
I... I'm sorry! Your clothes... of course... I should have realized!
...order of his eminence... ...possessor of these papers... the [QUOTE]Gourmet[QUOTE]...
I... I'm sorry! I didn't realize! We... we had no idea who to expect, you understand. You're not dressed as I would have suspected...
But please, don't let me keep you. Proceed to the kitchens straight away. Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival.
Please, excuse my ignorance.  Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival. You should proceed to the kitchens straight away.
Yes, headmaster.
How are your students coming along?
Bunch of distractions, if you ask me. They just interrupt the rest of my work.
Try not to play favorites, Lady Ateia. It does a disservice to the whole class.
Of course not! Complacency is the bane of art. They're in good hands with you, Inge.
Some of them have a long way to go, but they're mostly passable. Don't let them hear I said that, though!
Passably. Aia is my star pupil. None of the others can hold a candle to her. Especially not that wretched llldi.
I'm sorry to break it to you, Giraud, but students are an unfortunate necessity of a college. Do try to persevere.
Yes? What is it?
Get away from me.
A pleasure, thane.
Piss off. I'm busy.
Who did this to me?
How do you do, thane?
What can I do for you?
What was it you wanted?
Back, eh? Ready to brawl?
How can I help you today?
You up for another wager?
Talos bless you, my child.
Blessings of Mara upon you!
Hey! Good to see you again.
How may I help you, my son?
Blessings of Talos upon you.
Looking for a place to stay?
Blessings upon you, traveler.
So cold, so hungry, so tired.
This is unfair! I'm innocent!
Can't wait to get out of here.
What is it you seek, my child?
What? What are you looking at?
Brynjolf sent you to rub it in?
What can I get you? Mead? Wine?
You're a stranger here too, eh?
How may I help you, my daughter?
Is there something I do for you?
You really shouldn't be in here.
Did Harrald send you to taunt me?
Come to laugh at the grave tender?
You looking for something or what?
Did you bring anything? The pain...
Hello. Welcome to the Pawned Prawn.
Welcome back! Good to see you again.
Any luck gathering those ingredients?
The throne suits me, don't you think?
Well met, friend. How can I help you?
I believe you have a delivery to make.
Welcome back to the temple, messenger.
I can feel you laughing behind my back.
Here to purchase some armor or a weapon?
I trust the day's found you well, thane.
I wouldn't stay here long if I were you.
You don't impress me. So don't even try.
Looking for some armor? A weapon perhaps?
Oh, it's you. Not here to rob me are you?
The prisoners are in rare form, as usual.
This city is corrupt! You're all corrupt!
What in the name of Oblivion do you want?
Ah, you're back. What have you discovered?
Any luck getting the marks from those men?
Anything else before you make the journey?
I'm feeling much better now thanks to you.
Oh, it's you. Come to extort more from me?
The pilgrimage is complete, I can feel it.
You gonna stare all day or buy some armor?
Some fresh meat to fill your belly perhaps?
Waste of talent throwing me in here, right?
Well, if it isn't my little problem-solver.
Has the Warmth of Mara been given to Riften?
Steward Hemming Black-Briar at your service.
Thanks again for delivering that ore sample.
I can see that disapproving look in your eye.
Hm? Sorry, just thinking about my experiments.
I presume you have something important to say?
Lady Mara bids you welcome to Her Benevolence.
Got horses that need shoeing, so make it quick.
I'm feeling much better thanks to your efforts.
Oh, it's you again. What in blazes do you want?
Oh, my aching head. Why do I do this to myself?
Have you managed to make it out to Shor's Stone?
I presume you're bothering me for a good reason?
Let me out of here, damn it! I'm not a criminal!
New in town, eh? Here for the fishing I'd guess.
Nothing like the smell of a white-hot blade, eh?
Stay outta trouble, or there's gonna be trouble.
Did you have some sort of official business here?
How can a humble servant of Talos help you today?
I don't have time for idle chit-chat. What is it?
Visitors like us are rare in this part of Skyrim.
Wilhelm was pleased with the delivery, well done.
I'm the brewmaster around here. What did you want?
Is it daylight out? Night? I lose track down here.
I'm Riften's appointed Steward. How can I help you?
Welcome to the Pawned Prawn. What can I do for you?
Where's my head? I never even greeted you properly.
Did you get that purchase agreement to Markarth yet?
What brings you to Balimund today? Repair? Purchase?
A Dreth never forgets a traitor. You'll pay for this!
Can I interest you in some fine goods from Morrowind?
Come to see Balimund perform miracles with steel, eh?
Have you come to gawk at me or is this a social call?
If you're looking for a bed, this is the wrong place.
Watch your step in here. The stonework gets slippery.
Even if you're one of us, you better not make trouble.
Hm. You're not from around here. Imperial spy perhaps?
I can't believe it! Grelod is dead! She's really dead!
I hope you're finding the city in proper order, thane.
If there's anything you need, I'd be glad to help you.
My mind is on my experiments today. What did you need?
Riften's under my protection. You watch yourself, now.
I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your hands to yourself.
I'm beginning to think leaving Mournhold was a mistake.
Less coin in everyone's pocket means less coin in mine.
This place has seen better days, but it's not my fault.
Visiting Riften? All are welcome at the Temple of Mara.
Hey, don't look at me that way! Who are you to judge me?
I'm selling the best mead in town for cheap. Interested?
So what if I have a problem? I know how to deal with it!
Vekel doesn't like strangers snooping around the Flagon.
Ah finally, someone besides the stupid guards to talk to.
I'm quite busy. Need something or can I get back to work?
Speak, I wish to hear everything my subjects have to say.
Too lazy to walk, eh? Well, you've found the right place.
Please to meet you, I'm a priestess at the Temple of Mara.
The only way to find fresher meats is to hunt it yourself.
Horses are all I know. I've been riding since I could walk.
If there's anything you wish to purchase, just let me know.
The Bunkhouse isn't an inn. I'd recommend the Bee and Barb.
If it's horses you want, you're talking to the right person.
Welcome to Mistveil Keep. I'm Jarl Laila's steward, Anuriel.
Why's someone like you want to hang around a place like this?
You've caught me at a bad time. I've lost someone dear to me.
Careful. Riften's not the safest place for a nighttime stroll.
If it isn't the best brawler in Skyrim. Good to see you again!
You look kind of scary. But nobody is scarier than old Grelod.
Come to gloat, have we? To poke fun at the jarl's youngest son?
I'm afraid my days as the steward of Riften has come to an end.
If you're looking for conversation, The Flagon isn't the place.
Please help me, I'm going to lose my job at the Riften Fishery.
If anything pleases the eye, don't hesitate to make me an offer.
Sorry about the mess. Keeping this place clean is quite a chore.
There's a reason the city guard doesn't come down here you know.
Welcome to Riften, traveler. I hope the road fared well for you.
Come on, come on. The sooner you buy, the sooner I can get drunk.
Thanks again for the delivery to Markarth. What can I do for you?
They threw me in here because I called Ulfric a liar; a deceiver.
Lady Mara's messenger returns. What can I help you with, my child?
So, you're Brynjolf's new protege, eh? Don't look like much to me.
The trees... they're beautiful here. Reminds me of autumn at home.
This is what happens to you when you speak your mind in this city.
You here for lessons like Ingun? Or did you wish to buy something?
Ah! A fellow Nord! I trust you're bringing the fight to the Empire.
But now, because of Ulfric's greed, countless lives have been lost.
If this isn't about official city business, you're wasting my time.
If you're hungry, Marise sells fresh fish... caught by yours truly.
You have some nerve coming back here after what you did to Keerava.
Constance Michel says we have to be careful of people we don't know.
I know you. Where was it? Hm. Oh! You were getting something for me?
If your allegiance lies with the Empire, we haven't much to discuss.
Last person who made trouble for Vekel ended up with a smashed head.
Oh what am I going do? I can barely afford to stay at the Bunkhouse.
There's fine steel at the Scorched Hammer, if you fancy a new blade.
There's two things to do at the Flagon: spend coin and then get out.
Greetings, honored friend. Could I interest you in some fine jewelry?
I killed scores of the Empire's men before I was forced to surrender.
If you're looking for a handout, you're not going to get one from me.
If you've got the coin, you're welcome here. Otherwise, hit the road.
Jarl Maven Black-Briar. Has a pleasant sound to it, wouldn't you say?
My title is just a formality. I've always been in charge around here.
Did we have an appointment? No... it was a delivery? I can't remember.
If you're looking for a handout, you'll want to speak with my husband.
You better have coin to pay for your drinks. There's no handouts here.
Hofgrir is a great teacher. I've learned so much about horses from him.
I hate it here. Grelod the Kind is the meanest person in all of Skyrim.
I have all sorts of interesting items for sale. Have you looked around?
If the forest wasn't so dangerous, I'd spend every spare moment riding.
We serve only the best here... Black-Briar Mead. May I get one for you?
Don't make trouble or else I'll ask Dirge to [QUOTE]walk[QUOTE] you out.
If it's horses you want, you'll want to speak to Hofgrir at the stables.
My only concern is for the children. The poor darlings have no one else.
Yeah? What do you want? If this is about the meadery, we can talk later.
You look like you could use a drink. What do you say to some cheap mead?
Being in exile is the most humiliating thing I've experienced in my life.
Have anything you wish to sell? I pay fair prices for all sorts of goods.
I just care about my husband so much and I hate to see him in this state.
I was named after the sound a lion makes. You know: rrroooaaaarr! Really.
Sure, sure. I'm a dirty beggar... why would you want to even speak to me.
There's nothing like fishing on Lake Honrich, you should try it sometime.
You going to buy something or just here for training? Otherwise, move on.
I'd request that when speaking to Jarl Laila, you show the proper respect.
Got a lot of nerve coming down here. People tend to get hurt in the Ratway.
I'm off work at the Black-Briar Meadery. I'll be back there in the morning.
Please, please. I need but a septim. A septim is all I ask. Is that so bad?
Working at the Riften Fishery is tough, but it puts some coin in my pocket.
Can you believe my former husband used to give most of our gold to the poor?
Do you have any idea how busy I am? My mixture could be burning as we speak!
I'm sorry, but the children aren't up for adoption right now. You should go.
If you're looking for extra work, talk to Vex or Delvin. They'll fix you up.
I've never seen Mjoll this upset about anything. The city really gets to her.
My experiments continue to go well thanks to you. How can I return the favor?
Excuse my disorganization, but I'm in the middle of some delicate experiments.
Grelod ain't going to like some stranger just hangin' around. Not that I care.
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't help you much right now... I'm currently in mourning.
I apologize in advance for my husband's crankiness; I promise you he means well.
I'm strong, and quick, and can do any chore you want. Come on, adopt me. Please?
You have no idea what it's like to have everything, then watch it all disappear.
Bolli's around somewhere, planning to feed the poor with his nonsense about Mara.
City's quiet enough now. But when the sun goes down, you best keep on your guard.
Why we bothered to capture Riften I'll never understand. Just look at this place.
Be brief Imperial, there's only so long I can stand being downwind of your stench.
I hear even the simple jobs are becoming difficult. It never used to be like this.
I used to hate it here, but it's not so bad anymore. Constance is real good to us.
If it's a bed you need, talk to Keerava in the Bee and Barb. She'll set you right.
If you have any jewelry to sell, I'd be glad to pay you a fair sum in gold for it.
My food is the best in all of Skyrim; always as fresh as the day it was collected.
Things are much better now that Grelod is dead, but still. I'm sick of this place.
Kill one person, and you can solve so many problems. I wonder at the possibilities.
Best not go wandering east of the city. Bandits been seen around Broken Helm Hollow.
I feel so helpless out here. The people of Riften depended on me, and I failed them.
Out of my way. The son of the Jarl has no time for idle conversation with travelers.
Perhaps the Stormcloaks might rally to take back Riften one day. Only time will tell.
Well, well. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. I've always got time for lovely ladies.
This city still reeks with the stench of the Stormcloaks. Makes me sick to my stomach.
Grelod... murdered. Here. I... I need... air... You... you... Get out of here! Get out!
It's been a long time since anyone joined us. Seems like people are in a rush to leave.
It's too bad the orphanage ain't letting us kids get adopted. I'd be the best son ever.
I hope that someday this city will be free from corruption and we can all live in peace.
The Imperials now control Riften and have placed Maven Black-Briar on the Jarl's throne.
Welcome! Allow me to recommend the Black-Briar Mead... the purest brew in all of Skyrim!
At this rate, he'll give the entire Riften Fishery away to charity. Then how will I live?
Have you met Balimund? I'm his apprentice. He's teaching me all about being a blacksmith.
I was fortunate enough to be guided by one of Silvenar's master armorers until he passed.
As Riften's Steward I'm afraid I can provide only limited assistance, but speak your mind.
If it's horses you want, I'm not sure I can help you. I have too much on my mind as it is.
My mother spares no expense where I'm concerned. I'm heir to the family fortune after all.
Come see me in the market if you're looking for the finest custom jewelry in all of Skyrim.
I really need your help! I don't want to lose my job at the fishery! What am I going to do?
Mjoll's brought me nothing but safety and piece of mind... and some lessons with the blade.
My children, Sibbi and Ingun, are being groomed to run the family business one day as well.
My parents dropped me off here a year ago. But they're coming back to get me. They said so.
New around Riften? Take my advice. Stay at the Bee and Barb... the Bunkhouse isn't for you.
On second thought, maybe I'm better off in here. At least I'll die with a clear conscience.
Vekel and me, we have a thing going. Try anything with him and it'd be bad for your health.
Can't you bother me at my armor stand in the market? Or are you that desperate for training?
If you're ever in the market, I deal in specialty goods from Morrowind at one of the stands.
Vekel and me, we have a thing going. So I recommend you keep your hands off the merchandise.
It's one thing to say you've got the skills to be a thief. It's another to actually use them.
Pickings may be a bit slim today, but if you see anything you like I'll make you a good deal.
Take a look at my supplies if you must, but do hurry... I'm not getting any younger you know!
The last person that made trouble for Vekel ended up floating in the canal... catch my drift?
Something has to change soon or I may as well pack this place up and leave it for the skeevers.
By the gods, a dragon's been sighted just south of the city, flying around Lost Tongue Overlook.
Need a drink, you go to the Bee and Barb. Stay out of the Ragged Flagon, stay out of the Ratway.
So is it Riften or Rifton? This place has changed its name so many times, I can't even remember.
Talk of strange happenings at Autumnshade Clearing, just north of the lake. My guess? Spriggans.
Welcome to the cozy little family. I'm one of the lookouts for the Guild. I watch Delvin's back.
I can't believe Grelod is dead. I had no love for the woman, but to be murdered, in cold blood...
If you journey north, keep well away from Snapleg Cave. Damned Hagravens have infested the place.
Stick to the rules and you'll end up rich. Break them and you're out on your arse. Simple, right?
If you're looking for anything to sell for a fair price, I run the Pawned Prawn over by the market.
Now here I am, working for this dreary city's Fishery. I sometimes wonder why I don't just move on.
You could say the Ratway is the city under the city. Dark, dangerous, and no place for decent folk.
If Riften is the best Skyrim has to offer, I may as well turn back right now and just head for home.
Seems like capturing Riften is turning out to be more of a hassle than a benefit. But what do I know?
As Jarl Laila's housecarl, I would ask that you maintain a respectable distance from her at all times.
I'm really afraid of Grelod. When Aventus escaped, she was so mad. I got double the beatings that day.
Mjoll told me that it isn't this bad everywhere. Maybe one day I'll venture out and see if she's right.
The only reason I stopped fighting was a plea from Laila, otherwise I'd would have fought to the death.
If it's horses you want, you'll want to speak to Hofgrir. I'm afraid I'm in too much trouble to help you.
Welcome to the Bee and Barb, milady. If I can interest you in one of our special drinks, you let me know.
Welcome to the Bee and Barb, milord. If I can interest you in one of our special drinks, you let me know.
Bersi's afraid that someone's making a move to take the Pawned Prawn from us. I think he's being paranoid.
I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, this place has gone mad.
Unmid and Anuriel shouldn't blame themselves for Riften's fall, I am the one who's ultimately responsible.
I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, Grelod has been so angry.
I can't take this place anymore. The trees... all the colors, but the city, so dark. Why? It makes no sense.
There's an apothecary in town, yeah. But it's down on the lower walkway, so stay sharp if you go down there.
When Aventus took off, when he said those things, about killing Grelod... I never imagined he was serious...
I'm going to stop. That's what I'm going to do! Then everyone will see that I'm not as useless as they think.
Maramal thinks he's so smart; tells me that Mara will cleanse the filth from my blood. Ha! What does he know?
I don't care if you're best buddies with the Guild Master. I'll still smash in your skull if you try anything.
When Aventus escaped, Grelod was so mad. I got double the beatings that day. But that won't happen ever again.
We both own the Pawned Prawn together, but he's singlehandedly kept the place running despite all our problems.
Well met. I don't think they're hiring anyone at the moment, so if you're looking for work, you're out of luck.
When Aventus escaped, Grelod got meaner than ever. I really thought she was going to kill one of us. Guess not!
If you're here to report any instances of corruption, be confident that we're handling these rumors accordingly.
Sibbi will prove to be a fine leader one day, but Ingun... that girl has her mind somewhere other than business.
Mark my words. If Bolli thinks he's giving all of our wealth away to some poor slob, I'll leave him high and dry.
Such a waste of time preaching to the poor. If they're that hungry, they should just grow some food or something.
Once I'm in charge I have bigger aspirations than just Skyrim. I plan to bring Black-Briar Mead to all of Tamriel.
I was trained by some of the finest warriors in all Skyrim to wield a blade as if it was an extension of my own arm.
Now that the Empire's arrived in Riften, we've finally established a launching point into Morrowind... just in case.
Balimund took me in and has been so kind to me. I don't know why, but he thinks I can be a great blacksmith like him.
If Riften can be retaken, I will redouble my efforts to ensure the safety of my subjects and the defense of the Rift.
My husband Bersi will be the death of me. He spends too much time worrying about Riften and not enough about himself.
The fall forest makes me miss my childhood; playing among the towering trees in Valenwood and living with my brethren.
There's a foul presence coming from Darklight Tower, southwest of the city. Some say the place is home to necromancers.
Ulfric doesn't care about Talos. He yearns for the throne of Skyrim and he'll say anything to rally people to his side.
No one cares about us! No one! We could die and no one would ever even know! They'd just throw our corpses in the canal!
Seeing the sorry state of this city almost makes me regret my decision to leave my home when my apprenticeship completed.
With my husband's new found religion, what I do with our coin and what I do all day seem less important to him. Suits me.
On his deathbed, my master urged me to take over his business but I decided against it. I chose to wander Tamriel instead.
I run the meat and produce stand at the market. Come by and see me if you want some of the freshest food you've ever eaten.
If Indaryn finds out, he'll have me thrown out of the Meadery for certain. So don't breathe a word of it to him. Not a word!
City got attacked once by those damn bandits, come east across the lake, from Faldar's Tooth. They won't be trying that again.
I spend every Friday at the fishery, so I know the meaning of hard work. All those forms to fill out and file; it's exhausting!
To Oblivion with all of you! You rich piles of dung walking by us like we're not there! Pretending we don't exist! How dare you!
If you're looking for a handout, you'll want to speak with my husband. If you're looking for company, I suppose I could do worse.
Come to get yourself a kid? You're out of luck. No way Grelod will let any of us get adopted. Especially not since Aventus took off.
Edda... she's crazy as a loon, but at least she doesn't have the mind to realize what a horrible world this is. She's the lucky one.
At first I don't know why he picked me. I never even held a hammer in my life! But the first time I picked it up, it just felt right!
Fancy yourself the adventuring type, eh? It's just as well, I doubt your combat prowess would prove valuable in a real battle anyway.
I used to live at the orphanage here in Riften. Grelod said my ma and da left me there when I was a baby... that they didn't want me.
Constance don't care much for strangers in the orphanage. Afraid someone might hurt one of us kids. Which, I gotta admit, is kind of nice.
All the crime and corruption in Riften is really getting to him... and now that we hear rumors about the dragons, he's been very depressed.
My n'wah of a father thought he could pull my strings... [QUOTE]continue the Hlaalu tradition.[QUOTE] Bah! I left all that nonsense behind.
Are you scared of death? I am. I hear everything just stops... forever. It just all goes away, but you don't realize it. I don't want to die.
Folks in town say that Balimund is the greatest blacksmith in all of Tamriel. I hope I can live up to that some day and make him proud of me.
Just leave Riften. Go far, far away and never return. This place is nothing but a rotten, stinking corpse that's sat in the sun far too long.
You think you know pain? Do you!? Try watching your wife and daughter burn alive after they've been ravaged by brigands! That's pain, my friend.
Please, lady. You got to get me out of here. Ever since Aventus left, Grelod's been even meaner than usual. I swear, she's going to kill one of us.
Maven's disappointed that Ingun's heart isn't in the family business, but she says [QUOTE]Ingun still has her uses.[QUOTE] Not sure what that means.
Please, mister. You got to get me out of here. Ever since Aventus left, Grelod's been even meaner than usual. I swear, she's going to kill one of us.
You are nothing.
You did? Really?
This is the best news I've ever gotten!
I mean, I knew the Dark Brotherhood was good... just not that good! You killed the old hag before I even asked!
Oh, and please, take this as payment. It's an old family heirloom, supposed to be pretty valuable. It should fetch you a nice price. Thank you again!
You're an idiot.
Yeah, what of it?
So, Thrynn, you were a bandit, huh?
So is it true, bandits get... you know, real friendly with the wildlife?
You're cheating!
Stop it! This is a one-on-one duel!
It's no fun unless you fight me with magic.
I thought you were a wizard. Hit me with a spell!
This is a magic duel. Ma-gic. You know, with spells.
A moment, please.
Yes, Nightingale, what is it?
I wish to speak to Karliah for the moment.
Aha! You're back!
And you, Jorleif?
As you wish, sir.
A reasonable strategy.
A good point, old friend.
Galmar thinks we should double our men in the Reach.
But you're able to see the whole in the parts, and for that I'm grateful.
To be sure, my lord, I am not skilled in the arts of war or military tactics.
Well, sir, the hold of Falkreath is fairly vulnerable, and blocks the only road from Cyrodiil.
Are you prepared?
The trial awaits. Are you now prepared?
Once again you have come seeking something.
The circumstances differ. This time I have what you seek.
Captain, captain!
What is it now, Viola?
I... well. Perhaps. But still! It's curious.
Did you notice that the snow settles in a different direction near the murder sites?
Don't you think all your tramping around there investigating might have something to do with it?
Catchy, isn't it?
If I had been smarter, I would have kept my boat. Coming to this city was a big mistake.
I ended up selling that ship to open this place. Seemed only fitting to name it after her. Well, changed it a bit I suppose.
In my youth I was a fisherman... I had a beautiful ship named [QUOTE]The Brawny Prawn.[QUOTE] But the years have a way of creeping up on you.
Enough. Let's go.
I've thought this through, and it's the only way. She's too far gone, too corrupted by the Hags. At least in death she can be free again.
frustrated grunts
Give it, quickly.
Good day, Grelka.
You poor thing. You should come by the temple, speak to Maramal.
Religion isn't going to save me. So unless Mara is going to start raining coin from the heavens, why don't you mind your own business.
What's so good about it? I've got deadbeats who don't pay me, the city guard looking over my shoulder and Maven Black-Briar breathing down my neck.
Good luck to you.
Have you seen it?
Eirid and I are playing Hunt the Elf. It's my job to find the Elf, and kill it dead.
Here's your gold.
Did you try the grip? Isn't it eerie how it seems to mold itself into your hand?
Hey, who's there?
I will find you, Fjola!
Please, stranger! I need your help!
You - over here, quick. Before any of them show up!
Hist spit on you.
Daedra take you, then.
Horkers' revenge!
How goes it, son?
I'm fine, father. Work is fine.
Of course not. I never thought otherwise.
Right. Well, you let me know if you need anything.
Good, good. It's honest work, son. No shame in that.
I don't know you.
If anybody asks, this meeting never took place.
So you're the... the assassin? I need you to kill the Visiting Noble at Dragonsreach, in Whiterun. Here's the gold. I... I hope it's enough.
You're the one? From the... the Dark Brotherhood? The man I need killed is a Seasoned Hunter. He's just outside Falkreath. Here's the gold...
You must be the... assassin. I need you to kill the Itinerant Lumberjack, in Morthal, at the logging camp. Here, this is all the gold I have.
Are you the assassin? From the...? Well, there's this Traveling Dignitary, in Solitude. I need her... you know. This gold will cover it, right?
Good, you're here. Look, in Ivarstead, there's this Beautiful Barbarian. I need her dead. Don't ask why. Just do it. This gold should cover it.
Dark Brotherhood? You look the type. Listen, there's this Grim Shieldmaiden walking the streets of Markarth. Kill her. Now take this gold, and go.
So you're the one from the... Dark Brotherhood? I need you to kill the Big Laborer at Katla's Farm. Here's the gold for the kill. Make it painful.
You're the assassin, right? Look, there's this Reckless Mage in the Frozen Hearth Inn, in Winterhold. I want him dead. This gold should cover it.
I'm glad you're here. I need you to kill a Coldhearted Gravedigger, tends to work in the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm. This is all the gold I have.
You're here! I was wondering if that Black Sacrament even worked. I need you to kill a woman, a Poor Fishwife, on the Riften Docks. Here's the gold.
I will, I will...
Delvin, please tell me you have good news.
If I told you that, I'd be lying. We haven't had a bite in weeks. Our clients are starting to get angry.
You tell this sorry bunch of thieves that they need to put down their flagons and get to work if they want to keep their status!
I work the forge.
You work the forge.
They drink all day and night and what do I do?
I bet Naris gets a kick out it. Nasty fella he is.
Ah, the sweet smell of burnt flesh. Nothing better really.
Why do they need me to do this?  We use magic, not weapons.
Yeah, I don't know how I feel about what goes on down there.
You better quiet down before you end up there. Then I'd have to work the forge.
I swear they're making me do this for a laugh. At least I'm not dealing with the prisoners down below.
They die too quickly. Maybe I'll try and hold off on the paralysis next time. Give me more of a moving target. Good practice.
I'm eager to try.
You know, since Kodlak's funeral the Skyforge feels more... awake.
I'll wager it could now forge metal the likes of which hasn't been seen since eras long forgotten.
It's always been said that the souls of the heroes of old are what give Skyforge steel its strength.
But I think the forge knows the greatness of Kodlak's soul. I can't really explain, but it feels like it's... young.
I'm fine, Madena.
Still suspicious of me. Well, don't say I never offered.
I've seen you walking with a bit of pain sometimes, Horik.
I said I'm fine, Madena. I won't have some court mage fixing me up like some magical experiment.
I know old men sometimes have pains in their legs when they rise from bed. I know a few spells that could help.
Isn't it amazing?
I can't wait to see what's inside!
Patience. Give me a moment and I'll explain everything.
Just think. We're the first to set foot here in thousands of years.
It would ruin me.
Look. Perhaps we could come to some kind of agreement?
I'm the Jarl's uncle. He, his father, and I, swore oaths to the Empire to abandon Talos, as conditions of our return to the city.
Laila is a simple and traditional woman. Which makes it easy to manipulate her, but impossible to regain her graces once offended.
The Thalmor would need to make an example of me... I'd be thrown into prison, but our family's honor would be stained for generations.
I have a good thing going here. The Jarl benefits from my more creative arrangements as well, though it'd be impossible for her to admit that.
Jolly good guess!
Now you. You can call me Ann Marie.
If not... Then call me Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. Charmed.
But only if you're partial to being flayed alive and having an angry immortal skip rope with your entrails.
But only half right. I'm a mad god. The Mad God, actually. It's a family title. Gets passed down from me to myself every few thousand years.
Leave, outlander.
This is our stronghold. Leave.
Outsiders. Nothing but trouble.
This stronghold is for the Orcs. Leave. Now.
We don't know you, and we don't want you here.
Malacath blesses us with this land. It's not for your kind.
Outlanders should learn to not wander where they don't belong.
What are you doing here, outlander? We don't deal with your kind.
You've no right to be here. This place is for Orcs. And Orcs alone.
Let's see here...
Yeah, got this note.
I have a letter here for you.
Looks like that's it. Got to go.
A note from someone named Calcelmo, in Markarth.
I have a letter here from Quintus Navale in Windhelm. He said it was urgent.
It's from... Falk Firebeard at the Blue Palace? You've got friends in high places.
A letter... not sure who from. He wouldn't say. Just that he was a friend of yours.
There's a new museum opening up in Dawnstar. The owner is asking me to hand out invitations to travelers.
I've got a letter and a lot of gold. Something about it being your inheritance? Oh, and... sorry for your loss.
Looking for work?
There it is!  On the table.
That gem looks suspicious to me.
An alchemy lab, it could be in here.  It's worth a look.
These wall carvings are ancient, we must be getting close.
Maybe the order has something to do with the Symbols up there.
Good riddance.  Let's move on, the scroll must be in the next room.
That's Vokun, the guardian of the scroll.  It must be just past him.
This looks like some sort of lever puzzle.  We'll have to figure out the correct order to flip them.
Mistress, a word?
Certainly, acolyte. What troubles you?
I know, and I appreciate it dearly. But I can't help but feel we could be doing more...
Kynareth has blessed you with tremendous compassion, Silana. You will find a way, I'm sure of it.
What could be more important than hearing the prayers of the faithful, and answering the questions of the dedicated?
We took you in, didn't we? We would be glad to extend our welcome to any other who showed your dedication. What more could we do?
Mistress, the people of Solitude are destitute. Many are starving and desperate for work. We need to be more active, to reach out to them.
I know you and father Rorlund have many duties to attend to in the temple, but sometimes I feel that there are more important matters to attend to.
No one here does.
It sounded like they were heading there, though they were rather secretive about why.
The Synod seemed convinced it was somewhere in Skyrim. They inquired about the ruins of Mzulft, but that's all I remember.
I suppose if you're intent on looking for the staff, there's a chance they might be in Mzulft yet. Just don't expect them to be cooperative.
Not this again...
Hush, Vulwulf... let the boy speak.
How are things at the Meadery, my dear?
It has everything to do with politics. Asgeir my son, you have so much to learn.
Father, I promise you, this has nothing to do with Empires or politics. It's just business.
It's going very well, actually. The war hasn't even slowed down our production or shipping at all.
Of course it is. That's what happens when you're partners with a corrupt Imperial whore like Maven.
Vulwulf! The Empire may be our enemy, but Asgeir is still our son and we're a long way from Cyrodiil.
Nothing personal.
So, you made it out of there alive. Ancano was right... you are dangerous.
I'm afraid I'll have to take that Staff from you now. Ancano wants it kept safe... oh, and he wants you dead.
Now off with you!
Who are you? What do you want?
Hmph. I was wrong about you. I see that now. Maybe we all were.
Come now, you've got your orders. What else could you possibly need?
All you've got to do is find and kill one lousy chef. The clock is ticking...
Oh, and if you can, hide his body. The longer it takes for anyone else to determine his real identity, the better.
Now, you'd better get a move on and see Astrid. It's time! Time for the final stage of this grand and glorious operation.
Here's your payment. And... a little something else, as well. From me. Consider it my way of apologizing. For being so damned curmudgeonly!
As I was saying... You'll need to kill the Gourmet, of course. But what's more, you'll need to get his Writ of Passage, so you can take his place.
Remember, the Markarth Keep. That's where you'll find Anton Virane. Probably cooking up all of the Gourmet's recipes, passing them off as his own.
It's called the Nightweaver's Band. I wore this for years. I want you to have it now. It'll give your magic and sneakiness some much needed [QUOTE]oomph.[QUOTE]
Of course you do.
All right. What's your fancy?
What exactly are we talking about here?
Tell me what you need, and I'll get my people get on it.
I'm afraid that's it, my friend. I've done all I can. I hope the place is at least livable now. Good luck with, your, um... murders.
The Dawnstar Sanctuary? That where you lot are holing up in now? Hmm... Tell you what. It'll cost you - a lot - but I can help you out.
Oh. Oh, I see....
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.
Bothela, I have a question....
Don't be. We all make mistakes.
I'm sorry. You don't have to tell me if you don't....
I was actually just wondering if you had any family....
I have one. A nephew. He's in prison for being a member of the Forsworn.
You want to know a secret of mine, young girl? The most effective poison to kill a man? A potion to make others fall in love, perhaps?
On one condition.
You have to find the way out first. Good luck with that.
Now that's the real question, isn't it? Because honestly, how much time off could a demented Daedra really need?
So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to leave. That's right. I'm done. Holiday... complete. Time to return to the hum drum day-to-day.
Pirates, you see.
Sad, isn't it? We can't afford to keep the place running since these attacks started.
Raiding all along the coast, from Hammerfell to Vvardenfell. Only the Shatter-Shields appear safe.
Ready to do this?
We make quite a team, eh?
Hey there! I was wondering if I'd run into you out here.
What brings you? You have the look of purpose in your eyes.
I'll stay here and guard the shipment. You get back to camp with news.
Have you seen those Briarheart men? That's some evil magic right there.
Have them send some men - with a new wagon. This one isn't going anywhere.
We're going to take out their sentry, then sneak into their camp and ambush them.
The Reach is a beautiful but dangerous place, eh? One false step and you'll fall to your death, that is if those Forsworn don't get you first.
Really? How nice.
Relax, new blood.
Some of them, anyway.
Fighting people is different. Smarter.
I've been hunting on my own for years.
Rexus. The items.
The sealed letter will explain everything that needs to be done. The amulet is quite valuable - you can use it to pay for any and all expenses.
Right... Helgen..
So now he's dead.
Roggvir. He opened a gate and they executed him for it.
He opened a gate and the wrong man rode out of it. If that man hadn't been Ulfric Stormcloak. If Ulfric hadn't killed High King Torygg...
But it was Ulfric. And he did kill the High King, in honorable combat. My brother refused to allow the the Imperials to take revenge for the deed.
So you may think.
So... we're done?
Thank you, Laila.
We... don't have enough to...
I'm certain you're aware of the loss I sustained a fortnight ago.
Indeed. We lost three soldiers in that attack. A sad day for Riften.
No, that won't be necessary. You'll have compensation for your loss.
Thank you, Laila. I wanted to discuss the protection of my shipments.
Maven! Always a pleasure to receive you. What can I help you with today?
I have payments to make you realize. If I can't make them, I can't make Black-Briar Mead.
Laila, Riften is my home, but if my meadery can't be safe here, I'll just move it elsewhere.
Yes, indeed. An entire caravan shipment of your mead taken by Imperial soldiers. What of it?
Quite. To be brief, I need compensation for the lost shipment. Since Riften was responsible for it, Riften should pay for it.
Well, I'm also certain you're aware that our own city guard failed to provide the protection required to ensure safe passage of the shipment.
The one and only.
Gather 'round all!
He has to be lying!
This is ridiculous.
What a waste of time.
How much does it cost?
You need to hear this!
Grow back that missing limb!
Live for thousands of years!
Only twenty septims a bottle!
This way everyone! Over here!
See into other people's thoughts!
Why would you even listen to him?
Everyone! Everyone! Gather 'round!
Wield powerful magic incantations!
This is just what I need right now.
Twenty coins? No one has that much.
He gives other merchants a bad name.
Damn. I knew I shouldn't have waited.
I dunno, sounds like I should try it.
No pushing, no shoving. Plenty of room!
What if he's right? Maybe I'll buy one.
Don't listen to him, he's making this up.
Come on, Brynjolf... what is it this time?
Please hurry, I have only a few bottles left!
Who knows what powers the elixir will unlock!
Lads and lasses I give you, Falmerblood Elixir!
Learn a library's worth of knowledge in moments!
I could get rich and stop selling these trinkets.
Oh come on, are you talking about the Snow Elves?
I can't afford to get one, but can I afford not to?
That Wisp Essence didn't help, but maybe this will.
How did you get that, then? No one's seen them in years!
Only twenty gold septims! Hurry before my supply is gone.
I have something amazing to show you that demands your attention!
That was a simple misunderstanding, but this item is the real thing.
Well, I see that my time is up. Come back tomorrow if you wish to buy.
Patience, Brand-Shei. This is a rare opportunity, and I wouldn't want you to get left out.
That's what you said about the Wisp Essence and it turned out to be crushed nirnroot mixed with water!
My sources must remain a secret for their own protection but I can promise that the contents are genuine.
Mystical beings who live in legends and were masters of great magic. Imagine the power that coursed through their veins!
One sip of the elixir and your wishes will be granted. Great wealth, everlasting life or perhaps limitless power could be yours!
They're fearsome!
Oh, probably a troll.
Oh of course. My mistake.
They are indeed. Nothing like your mother, though!
What's the most dangerous beast you've ever killed?
That's what everyone keeps saying. But you didn't kill her. That's what I was asking.
This way, my son.
This way, my daughter.
This way... the library isn't far.
If you change your mind, I'll be here.
Let's continue, we still have much to do.
Once we get inside, all will become clear.
Take your time. I understand your hesitation.
Come, we must get to the Skull and destroy it.
I promise to answer all of your questions. Follow me.
We mustn't tarry... the Skull needs to be destroyed as soon as possible.
If you'll check the shelves around the balcony, I'll check around the lower level.
The Torpor should be in a tall bottle with dark liquid. If you find it, bring it to me.
The laboratory adjoins the library. I'm hoping we'll find a sample of the Torpor left undamaged.
This way, please.
If you wish to talk, I'll be here for a bit.
Proceed down the hall to the gate when you're ready.
Please hurry, we need to catch Mercer before he leaves Skyrim.
Thorald? Thorald!
Unngh...  Uhhh...
All right, mother.
What in the world?
Let's go, let's go!
Welcome to our home.
I must be on my way now.
I owe you my life, friend.
Brother? Is... Is that you?
Get to the nearest way out!
I'm here! I knew I'd find you!
Please, get word to my mother.
Please, let's speak privately.
You there! What are you doing?
I can't believe you came for me!
We've got to find Thorald quickly!
Let's get out of here, fast as we can!
Please tell me you have news of my son.
The Thalmor need to be taught a lesson.
I'll see you at Northwatch Keep, friend.
Do you have news? Did you find something?
No one should ever be left to the Thalmor.
We're getting Thorald back, no matter what.
If only you could help bring my son back to me.
Keep going! We need to get farther away from here!
Please, anything you can do to help find my Thorald...
Thorald's disappearance has left our family in shambles.
Avulstein, put that down! He's here to help us find Thorald!
Avulstein, put that down! She's here to help us find Thorald!
I owe Thorald my life. Helping to save him is the least I can do.
I can't take any more of this. No weapons, please. Let's just talk.
How do we know he's not spying for the Battle-Born? This was foolish!
There's no time. We've got to get you out of here! Come on, let's go!
How do we know she's not spying for the Battle-Born? This was foolish!
We can't trust anyone! Who knows what they'll do if they find me here.
Mother, what's the meaning of this? Who have you brought into our home?
I pledged to aid Avulstein and Thorald a long time ago. There's nothing that could keep me from helping them now.
To see the fires!
Do you ever want to go to Morrowind, Sondas?
I think I like the lake here just a little more.
I've been in Skyrim my whole life. Why would I want to leave?
Watch the blades.
So who's winning now?
Great, back to the fight.
Always good to see 'em go.
Keep a sharp eye about you and maybe I'll teach you to fight some day.
We hunt together.
We summon Potema!
Stop the intruder!
I shall not be bound.
You're making a mistake!
No! I'm losing the binding.
Th...thank you, my Jarl thank you.
Yes! Yes! Return me to this realm!
Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
Come back to me if you find anything.
Did you find anything at Wolfskull Cave?
Something is wrong. There is an intruder.
You ants don't have the power to bind me!
Thank you, Jarl Elisif. But about the cave...
Wolf Queen. Hear our call and awaken. We summon Potema!
Perhaps a more... tempered reaction... might be called for?
I've got what I came for, I better get back to Dragon Bridge.
What! What are you doing?! You fools! You cannot bind me to your wills!
As our voices summon you the blood of the innocent binds you Wolf Queen!
I will have someone take care of the cave as well Varnius, you can rest easy. You're dismissed.
Long have you slept the dreamless sleep of death, Potema. No longer. Hear us Wolf Queen! We Summon You!
Oh. Yes, of course you are right. Falk, tell Captain Aldis I said to assign a few extra soldiers to Dragon Bridge.
I swear to you, unnatural magics are coming from that cave! There are strange noises and lights! We need someone to investigate!
Then we will immediately send out a legion to scour the cave and secure the town. Haafingar's people will always be safe under my rule.
Your eminence, my scrying has suggested nothing in the area. Dragon Bridge is under imperial control. This is likely superstitious nonsense.
Well met, hunter.
What do you mean?
That s'wit. One day, he'll regret pushing all of us around.
Do you know what Indaryn told me? He said if I'm late one more time he'll kick me right out the door!
All I'm saying is Indaryn's going to push someone too far one day and they're going to push back... hard.
What do you want?
Something I can get for ya?
Anything you need, just holler.
Need a room? Or maybe just some mead?
Hadring got himself another customer, eh?
I value my privacy. So if you don't mind?
Thank you again for resolving my... problem.
The beds and beer are both lousy, you ask me.
Sure, walk away. I wasn't talking or anything...
I can't help you, friend. Talk to Hadring, the Innkeeper.
Ah, hello there, traveler. Come to the Nightgate for food or lodging?
I really don't mean to be rude, friend, but I'm not feeling particularly sociable...
What? What is it?
Must you keep stopping?
Yes, yes, what is it now?
Quickly, what did you want?
Glad the antidote is taking effect.
There's little time for talk, what do you want?
You're quite noisy for someone who claims to be a thief.
Whatever you say.
I don't know what he's talking about. He must be seeing things.
Aerin tells me you might be dealing arms to the Thieves Guild. Is this true?
I'm watching you, Grelka. One slip up and I report you to the guards. You got that?
Who has a sister?
Not today, we can't.
Can we both be chiefs?
Do you ever get a weird feeling about those sisters?
Mauhulakh's aunts. You know... the way they're all around him all the time.
That's just how it is with families. When we're chiefs, you'll see how it is.
Yeah, sure, okay.
Come on, this way. I've seen the guards use it to get rid of bodies. It must lead somewhere.
Yeah? What is it?
I hope I'll see you in Solitude. Good luck.
It's nice to be back in a friendly spot, huh?
Take what you need, my friend. Within reason, of course.
I still almost can't believe it... a real, live dragon...
I hope that dragon isn't still flying around here somewhere.
Listen, I'm going to lay up here for a while. You can make your own way to Solitude from here.
I'd recommend heading to Whiterun, just down the road from here. From there you can take a carriage to Solitude.
Yes? No? Nothing?
Very well, then. If you'll just... get going now...
You are new, yes?
Have you mastered the Expert level destruction spells yet?
You are, are you?
Come on, I'll explain on the way.
I don't much like this, I'll tell you. But you've saved my skin, so maybe I can overlook the past for now.
Savos wouldn't even grant us an audience when we came to you, but now you come here expecting something from me?
You bear my ring.
Your fealty is precious to me. I will make good use of it.
You have no idea.
I'm joking, of course, but I'm a lot happier seeing the Empire running things in Windhelm.
Did you know it was his decree that forbade the Argonians from living inside the city walls?
I hope in his next life, he's reborn as an Argonian forced to live in a slum because of some bigoted Nord dictator.
You need but ask.
I can ask no more. Thank you, my lord!
I'll think on this, but I make no promises.
I'm still not sure I understand what you're asking.
But most of their supply routes come south, from Cyrodiil.
And I suppose the Cruel-Seas would be just the clan to provide ships and men?
A navy, my lord. We could stop the influx of Imperial troops to Solitude, and choke their northern lines.
But imagine -- fleets of ships sailing from Windhelm, all bearing the Stormcloak flag! It would be glorious!
You play so well.
With you as my muse, how could I not?
Oh, Sven. You do know how to turn a girl's head.
You want a drink?
A debt. Is a debt.
No. I have my pride.
On my honor, I won't bother Carlotta ever again.
And I told you I'd pay it when I'm good and ready.
They don't work now. Why should I waste more money?
What did you just say? All I heard was the sound of jealousy.
I'm in charge of the smelter. Not you. So why don't you lay off?
Bold words, but true. Fine, you win. I'll pay the Argonians more coin.
Fine. You sound like a priest of Mara, but I get your point. Tell him to forget about the gold.
Maybe you're right. I guess I just didn't want anyone to think I couldn't handle one Nord lass.
I guess you're right. A Nord shouldn't be so proud to turn down a kind soul's generosity. Tell Iddra I'll be fine.
You're right. What would my forefathers think if they knew I wasn't paying my debts? Tell Haran I'll bring her the gold I owe.
All right, all right. You sound like a damn Legion officer, but I get it. I'll give him a break. This better not hurt our quota.
Ah, there you are.
And how about you?
And so it is done.
Ahh, yes. I see it now.
It's magnificent, isn't it?
I need only look for a few moments...
Another quiet day.
Keep walking, stranger.
Where is that lazy man?
Another quiet day... I hope.
Faida's the name. I keep the inn.
Did my worthless husband send you?
Got nothing to say to strange folk.
Please stop looking at me like that.
I'm hoping to run my own inn someday.
Don't see many travelers out this way.
Heard there were wolves on the road up north.
Welcome, traveler. Mind yourself in our town.
Those rebels better not try coming to Haafingar.
You look like you've seen your share of adventure.
Rest a spell! Can't work every minute of your life.
If you're looking for handouts, look somewhere else.
Are you a soldier? One day, I'm going to be a soldier!
Got nothing to spare for travelers nor refugees, here.
This land's tough and unforgiving, but beautiful, too.
If you're looking for a room, you want the Four Shields.
Mind you don't cross Tassius. He's in charge around here.
Seen a lot of travelers lately. Mostly soldier, nowadays.
First the war and now there's talk of dragons. What's next?
It's no easy thing to make a living in the wilds of Skyrim.
You're a well-traveled sort, I can tell just looking at you.
Respect the law, and you'll have no trouble in Dragon Bridge.
Don't start any trouble and I think we'll get along just fine.
You hear all this talk about a war? I hope it never comes here.
You going to try and sell me something? Well, I ain't interested.
You want anything in this life, you gotta take it. Just not from me.
Faida's teaching me the innkeeper's trade. She runs the Four Shields.
Have you met Lucky? He's my pet goat, and he helps me patrol the town.
We aren't a big city like Solitude or Markarth, but we like it this way.
At least, if you're gonna cause trouble, go somewhere else, okay? Please?
I wish I was a soldier! They get to travel and stay up late and have fun!
If it weren't for Michel, I'd probably be dead in a Markarth gutter by now.
You met the Lylvieves? Quiet family, but they're the heart of Dragon Bridge.
I think the dragons are here to test us, and make sure we're still true Nords.
Money's been tight since the mill burned down. My wife won't let me forget it.
Something different about you, I can tell. Hope you ain't here to cause trouble.
The meals I serve ain't what I'd call a Jarl's feast, but they'll fill your belly.
Pa says I'm too young to fight in the war, but I can still help by patrolling the town.
Got a loving wife, a healthy son and a patch of land to call my own. What more could a man ask for?
Working hard gives a man reason for drinking hard! Well, that and putting up with a wife like mine.
You been to Markarth? They've got a tavern called the Silver-Blood Inn. Best ale this side of Skyrim.
Seen some mean-spirited folk pass through lately. Thought I was rid of those sorts when I left Markarth.
Poor Horgeir. Everyone in town knows about his wife's affair but him. Probably better if he doesn't know.
They say a strong drink, a sharp axe and a good woman are all a Nord needs to be happy. Two out of three's not bad.
I was a barmaid at the Winking Skeever when I met my husband, rest his soul. Wasn't for him, I'd still be working there!
As you were, then.
Be safe, traveler.
Good to talk to you.
Be seein' you, stranger.
We're done here, I think.
May wisdom forever light your path.
May your time in Falkreath be pleasant.
Mark my words, I'll be Jarl again someday!
I'll be right here if you need anything else.
Perhaps one day, I'll write a song about you!
See me at my forge if you need arms or armor.
Good steel's worth every septim. Remember that.
Keep in song in your heart to ward off the gloom.
Life is far too short, my friend. Don't waste it!
Steal anything from my shop, and you'll regret it.
Mind what you say! The Empire has ears all over this town.
Come and see me again sometime. I might have some use for you.
Don't judge Dengeir too harshly. He is old, but he means well.
You hear any juicy gossip in town, be sure to share it with me!
We'll all meet Arkay sooner or later. Best to enjoy the time we've got.
You'll meet a lot of tongue-wagging gossips in this town. Try not to take them too seriously.
Can we talk later?
Come on! Let's go.
I cannot be beaten!
I'm ready. Let's go!
I feel... unbeatable.
No one can defeat me.
I ain't scared of nothin'.
Even my claws feel sharper.
I'm ready. More than ready.
I've never been more ready!
I've never felt this brave.
Just point me to the fight.
Ha ha! Look out. Here I come!
I'm just itching for a fight.
I feel like I can beat anyone.
By Ysmir, I feel... invincible!
I feel like I can beat anything.
I fight and I'll win. Simple as that.
There is none who can stand in my way.
I feel like I can take on all of Skyrim.
Hmph. Everyone seems so insignificant now.
Been too long since I've embraced my rage...
Suddenly I feel like I can take on the world.
Bah! Is there no one who can offer a challenge?
I may be old, but I can show 'em a trick or two.
My claws are sharp. My will to kill... unquenchable.
Come on, I can take anyone. And that ain't just the mead talkin'.
By the gods, I feel like I could crush a giant's head like a walnut.
Come, my champion.
Don't worry, I am.
Can I make something now, papa?
All right. But I am getting a bit tired of waiting.
I'm bored standing around, papa. I could take over for you...
Is it time yet? Time for me to make my sword? Or maybe... an axe?
He he. Not just yet, Dorthe. I need to keep forging, and you need to keep watching.
Later, little one. I need to finish what I'm working on. But keep watching. Watch, and learn.
Patience, Dorthe. You'll get some time at the forge, I promise you. But not right now. You need to keep watching me. That's how you'll learn.
Fine, here you go.
But you don't, do you?
Oh, I'd gladly sell it to you if you had the money.
You get killed on account of this thing, it's not my fault. Got it?
But, I suppose, if it does actually turn out to be worth something, let me know, will you?
For me? From whom?
Go on in, already.
Our vengeance will come.
You're a slave. Just like us.
Well, what do you say, my brothers?
Let me out. They're going to kill me!
Our struggle is our people's struggle.
You're back. Have you done what I asked?
Remember. It was the Nords who locked you up.
Do you remember the sun? Because you'll forget. Soon.
But my little Aethra didn't want to see her papa leave her. She pleaded to the Jarl to take her instead.
What's going on, Madanach? You wouldn't have old Grisvar killed unless you weren't planning on needing him.
And after they made me watch as her head rolled off the block, they threw me in here anyway, to dig up their silver.
My brothers, we have been here long enough. It's time to leave Cidhna Mine and continue our fight against the Nords.
The Nords didn't care who was and who wasn't involved in the Forsworn Uprising. I had spoken to Madanach once, that was enough.
I had a daughter, once. She'd be 23 this year. Married to some hot-headed silver worker or maybe on her own learning the herb trade.
Through this gate, just beside my quarters, is a tunnel. A tunnel that leads right through the old Dwarven ruins of Markarth, into the city.
Gods I'm so tired.
By the Divines, I'm tired.
What troubles you, my son?
What troubles you, my daughter?
What is it? I haven't had much sleep.
These dreams are real I tell you. Real!
Yes, my son, what is it I can help with?
The Jarl is... tired. Be mindful of that.
Yes, my daughter, what is it I can help with?
Can't sleep well no matter how much drink I put in me.
No. I don't have anything for bad dreams, so don't ask.
Lady Mara will save us from these nightmares. You'll see.
You come to Dawnstar at a bad time. Tempers are... fiery.
You're wrong to come here, stranger. No rest in Dawnstar.
If I get any rest soon, I'll count myself richer than a king.
I envy you travelers. Dreams aren't affecting anyone not from here.
Unless you're here to solve this nightmare problem, I don't need you.
Need a room? Don't worry. Nightmares don't seem to happen for travelers.
If you're here about the nightmares, I'm afraid my pleas to the College of Winterhold go unheard.
Please. I must remain uninterrupted if I am to complete the ritual. Have no fear, your time will come.
Seems like no one is getting a decent night's rest in Dawnstar, stranger. Best buy your steel and move on.
Good, you're here.
Greetings, mother.
Watch out for pressure plates here.
I'll just prepare the subject now...
Daughter. Who is this you have brought me?
I'm going with you whether you like it or not.
This is the last hagraven between us and my mother!
I can't let you do this, mother. You have to die now!
Splendid! Please take a seat on the chair behind me, would you?
You want in there? Here's my spare key. Take whatever you want.
I found a willing subject for you. Payment has already been discussed, of course.
The door up ahead will be locked. Klotha, one of the hagravens, will have the key on her.
He is... the Void.
Hmm... That's like telling you about the cold of space, or terror of midnight. Sithis is all those things.
Hello, Lady Mjoll.
Madesi, my friend. How have things been since last week's incident?
It's my pleasure. If you see the Thieves Guild harassing anyone else, you be sure and let me know.
Ever since you scared off that thug from the Thieves Guild, not one of them's bothered me. We're lucky to have you here.
Hmm. We shall see.
How did you do it?
I appreciate that.
I beg your pardon?
Lucky for you, I possess a forgiving nature and I'm not easily insulted.
You must have me mistaken for someone else. I am Elisif, widow of High King Torygg and Jarl of Solitude.
I didn't touch it!
Hammers don't have legs.
Did you use my good hammer?
Did you look behind the forge? I think I saw it there.
Oh... yes. Now that you mention it, I think... sorry about that.
Blast, girl, I told you to leave my tools alone. You have yours and I have mine.
I don't blame you.
I serve no mortal!
I suppose so, yes.
I have no complaints.
Are you enjoying the party?
As much as can be expected, yes.
Is my staff seeing to your needs?
It pleases me to hear you say so.
Everything is splendid, thank you.
Is the food and drink to your liking?
Splendid. Call if you have need of me.
Excellent. I'll leave you to it, then.
Very much so, and thank you for asking.
I'll let him know.
Any word about our little problem in the Ratway?
I've spoken to Brynjolf and he assures me it'll be taken care of.
Next time you speak to him, tell him to clean up his own messes. I'm not about to jeopardize this position for a bunch of low-life thugs.
I'm afraid you do.
Is it not allowed?
I've heard some rumors... about you and Skjor.
And if you want to keep having ears, you'll pretend you didn't.
It's not exactly forbidden, but even so... it's not true. So that's that.
Is that wise, sir?
And the message, sir?
I'm diverting Gar and Haddring's men to join him.
Jorleif, I want you to send a messenger to our western camps.
I'm not seeking advice right now, friend. Just send the message.
Of course. Something that seems to be in short supply these days.
It will work if we can pull Hran's men from the south. And find a bit of luck.
It's about Ranmir.
Oh, I'm so glad you changed your mind.
It's not that bad.
Aw, quit your bellyaching.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Hope I don't draw guard duty.
This imperial armor is damn heavy.
You'd rather be plowing a field? Not me.
You must be all right if you've got time to complain.
I bet we have rabbit again. I'm getting sick of rabbit.
I'm still sore where I took that arrow. I hate archers.
I'm sick of waiting. When are we going to see some action?
We're running out of bread. I hope the supplies get here soon.
Go tell the commander. I'm sure the boot in your arse will take your mind off your troubles.
Let's talk inside.
Look for yourself.
I hope your trip to Labyrinthian was worth it.
Ancano's power is growing. We can't crack whatever magic he's using to shield himself.
My eyes are sharp.
But you said that was impossible.
They are, but your mind has to be sharp, too.
Come, child, I will tell you how to track a snow cat.
No, just very difficult. You have to look for shift in various shades of white.
No. Not like this.
Now, take a deep breath.
Twilight guide your path.
May Azura's magic protect you.
Tell me when you are ready, mortal.
All will happen as it has been foretold.
First, I'll need to grab hold of your soul.
This has all been foreseen, and we must play our parts.
I can send you into Azura's Star as soon as you're ready.
I told you what you wanted to know. What else could you want?
Azura is watching over you. She has seen this before it ever happened.
This is my realm now. I've sacrificed too much to let you take it from me!
The Twilight has foreseen all of this. Everything will be revealed in time.
No, only one option remains. I will send you inside the Star. You will banish Malyn's soul there.
The Star is free to purify itself. Don't worry, mortal. I will return you before you are cleansed.
Malyn's enchantments are broken. Hold on. I'm going to pull your soul out of there. Brace yourself.
Azura. Mother of Roses. Goddess of Dusk and Dawn. Your chosen champion has returned your Star to you.
She wishes to speak to you herself. Please. Place your hands on the altar, and you will hear her voice.
No harm shall come to me, for I live under Azura's wisdom. Her foresight protects me. Her insight sustains me.
And who are you to challenge me? I have conquered mortality itself. I've spat in the eyes of the Daedric Lords.
These fissures and cracks aren't encouraging. Malyn obviously was growing more desparate once he left the College.
Azura. Who led her children away from the disaster of Vvardenfell. You are the prophet that reveals our true future.
Malyn wanted to alter the Star. He was dying. Disease. He thought he could store his own soul inside. Become immortal.
We are children of the Twilight. Beings who are to be guided from the darkness into the light. And from the light into darkness.
Eventually, the Star will fade back into my realm in Oblivion, but I doubt you have the hundred or so years it would take to wait.
He did it. He actually managed to trap his own soul inside the Star, but it's falling apart. It needs more and more souls to sustain itself.
It drove him mad. Students started dying. Eventually, the College exiled him. He took a few loyal disciples to Ilinalta's Deep and vanished.
Look, I don't care who asked you to find the Star, but don't take it back to Azura. The Daedra are evil. They're the reason Malyn went insane.
Not in our nature.
Speaking of harsh.
I could listen to her play all day.
I could listen to him play all day.
You Bards don't cut each other any slack do you?
He's okay. A little breathy and a little harsh on the notes.
She's okay. A little breathy and a little harsh on the notes.
Oh no, not at all.
But other than that, everything was business as usual. Now, do you have any other painfully obvious things to say?
I simply locked the doors, hid beneath my counter and prayed to the Divines that my life would be spared and my shop wouldn't burn to the ground.
Oh? What about it?
Sondas, I've heard about Morrowind.
I'll have to take your word on that one, my dear.
That it was black and gross and nobody wanted to live there anymore.
On your way, then.
Shut up, will you?
Let me do the talking.
Let's hope we both live through this day.
You made it in. Good. As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open this door and we can get you on your way.
So, the same then.
How are you feeling, Jarl Idgrod?
Do not worry, my friend. All is well.
The visions continue to hold me in balance, Gorm.
Sorry, Miss Temba.
I'm so sorry Miss Temba. Perhaps if you would have been more specific...
Gwilin! I told you to cut those boards at twice arm length! My arm's length. Not yours.
Sigh. Everyone isn't as short as you are... what good are these boards to someone of the proper height!?
Stop right there.
Talos be with you!
Then I commit them to whatever gods they still believe in.
Thank you, friend.
Thank you, milady.
Thank you, milord.
That's all I know.
Do what you have to do, I'm not giving up on Gleda.
Okay, okay. Most of what you said didn't make sense but you left a note. The only bit that I could read said [QUOTE]after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.[QUOTE]
