flubs is hiding nothing
i am surprised you didn't choose oot
and thats it
drago we are building a house
minecraft style
your fricken weird
maybe i should watch less anime
also make sure to have a great beard and mustache if you're evil <:kappa:374346980136058893>
::::::::
ive been banned from a server from my username
what is it called
even though i didn't know what the hell i did wrong
who what?
you age legal over
wolve can i just not breath through my nose within a foot of you or something
but is that an ssd
nice link <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i prefer using my mobo as a gpu and cpi
only a bitcoin miner is gonna want this anyway so why are they limiting them
and i have to roll it manually and also it isnt a car
byezers
it's in morse
you can use my armor in case i don't show up
that means you swung to attack.
you don't want to wait until we fight bosses?
no he climbed on the railing of a crane and fell off when alex said something about pressing keyboard b, and josh thought it was controller b.
well he played it through three times in that final area is something.
i would not reccomend playing it regardless. i'd rather play four swords adventures than tri force heroes
perfectly fine.
just a reminder that 3 diamonds are needed for the storage heart.
do we need a heart for each upgrade?
i get to yell "timber" so i have no objections to the changes
and does the stump have to be chopped for each of its blocks and not even drop any wood?
waking up tomorrow is going to be a pain, it's always more difficult in the cold
it was, ida.
i though drago said fashion for a sec
right, it's apparently because of latency, because i tried a singleplayer world and had no issues
i have no idea what the heck is even going on
i already deleted all of the installed mods, along with my character and world out of frustration since **no one** here was using the internet besides me
either way, ill just assume you mean the good kind
i'm not sure what the problem was.
i deleted everything out of **extreme** frustration
i dont really rage at games with good mechanics, so im having a blast
so i'm going to blame overhaul for my lag
fine fine
yeah i love running dishonored, but dishonored 2 made me want to die. its all so random
i don't know.
it changed my keys
i'm not that stupid to do it in a rage
how frustrated are you with me
i think i left my cactus armor somewhere
<:pogchamp:305560024443518986> can it come soon enough
\:thinking\:
because i think that message may have been ida's
🤔 do you think the lag has something to do with the gore?
all 3
and people actually like her music
it started at 11 mb.
oh ok, we'll wait for that then
so much we made a new funny class meme or word
gummy i will destroy you if i have to
thanks
quup off
i mean...on a normal day everyone is an asshole
currently -23 here
it gets to like 110 sometimes in the summer where i am
what is it stuck
i can’t wait to watch it
we lost guys
i haven't watched a movie in a long time
im actually really happy 030 was banned, it always took so much effort to not spam the copypasta
i always wanted to be a girl for a day tbh
hmmm interesting
either way cool
flubs did not read pawn
why would he have pics of stalin
its like how i have a lot of pictures of pregnant luigi
what?
like if we're in vc and he says "i hate seeing x on twitter" i will instantly send him that
looks like you gotta do something stuck
is makeup
:^ )
but i like his camera man
his brother recorded a dead man
the great thing about having 3 different favorites is nobody trying to compete over getting more of it if there is ever a meetup
i’ll send it to flubs because why not
sugar
i try to hold back.
im not a fan of hot food for the sake of it being hot
i want to believe they are
it has music playing in it
not sure if i'll get a lot of sleep today tbh
it's not that easy
master got into stuck’s bed
yeah sure why not
i'm placing my bet that school will be canceled yet again tomorrow.
in total, how many moons are there?
there's 880 moons in the game you can collect. but since you rebuy moons from the shops after beating bowser, the game caps (freaking puns) out at 999.
who’s that green loser?
he isnt a child
its there, but its like recreating a masterpiece as your first artistic work, you could do it...but it wont be nearly as wonderful
don't want to burn out too quickly after all.
wait wtf
i need to take care of things irl tonight so i don't think we'll be able to have a session tonight.
hey gummy boop me, for, uh, science \*cracks knuckles\*
brb pasta is overflowing
i got lazy on my farm world base
or slightly behind because effort
hopefully once we get some more life crystals we'll be able to take down eow faster.
uhhhh
that should be accurate
~~rawity~~
i don't remember doing that, but it sounds like something i'd do and i know i don't have very good memory
tell sarah she needs a fashion lesson from me
well i'm sure there's more than one.
the c word that isnt crap
and your name is rarity now
my pasta
you can ask permission from someone whose not the owner and its still stealing though
oh no i didnt mean the food
also made fun of a friend with lewd stuff
if you buy it for a year you get two months free
get that checked out
i can't use them here because no one can see them
wowza that's a huge emote
thats why
yes ida
its so dumb looking
ugh why did my old profile pic not look too good
it's always weird here in this place, squid
okay, i suppose "everything that isn't literally illegal and bears some semblance of safe for work"
he's probably twenty one in dog years
but hes almost 6, so prolly over 21
hey flubs
.. ... / -- --- .-. ... . / -.-. --- -.. . / -... .- -. -. . -.. / .... . .-. .
spooky
.
.
none of us have any knowledge in morse code, so we wouldn't understand it
all i did was make all the letters the next one in the alphabet
this rule is for the sake of everyone understanding, not being bent into a spaghetti
anyway, i have to go to bed no-- hours ago thanks to time zones so bye
now i want pizza...
me helping this person will be interesting because this time my age from this person is actually far apart. i’m way younger but i gotta think older and smarter
i don’t even know what that is
make games
that’s the word
fine but if i go to bed before then i expect you to be honest
oh btw in case i didnt mention, in est
sooooo all my work just got erased hehehehehehehe
benny has won a total of $10,000 so far
leona mid?
got battlefront 2
then you would have a pet penguin
flubs tell them about benny’s casino luck last night
eating it
i can't tell who raised the hand on mobile
christ, and it takes like an hour to launch, too
it's just 30 of them.
i just felt like taking a jab at logan paul 😛
it runs fine until it stops running
breaking dirt
sounded like a cat purring in one eat to me
perfect ida
the p stands for "public", silly goose
gonna try not running as admin on terra
heh heh you see what i did there?
its finnneeeeee
i just said i was the vi, i wasn't playing a tank
??? it's already 1 pm
its from an anime i really like
i have one pencil tho
i might only have 1 class on tues/thurs also since i'm thinking of dropping the public speaking class since i took another english class that i thought gave me credit for public speaking
anyways ida, farm the pirates for a lucky coin and a discount card.
just kill them all, nothing to be afraid of
this better work
have you been mining for ore in the depths biome also
also my internet is so bad right now thanks to the roku, it's taking forever to load the thorium wiki
because i couldn't
as far as i can tell it's just an in-house sequel to meme run
i outdamaged entire enemy team but vayne
not just his poor performance
if he likes you
you got two hours left come on sarah what the hell dont walk away come on just play some more we're almost done no please dont leave
i never went to the library
so i dont like the beach
you mean the income thing
so id rather have 4 extra years of trying to get a job than 4 years of working up debt
he gets to wear high heels
squid, are you a good kiss ass
all of my interests are video games <:lul:305559915714576385>
oh then nvm
it would take forever to upload 1080p for me
i dont really care what quality its in
because it is soooo important for me to self promote myself
good
gummy thas literally even worse
that's not a person gummy
*the world isnt that black and white! from my perspective, im the hero and youre the villian trying to stop my valiant plan of setting the entire population on fire
i could tell they were being flirty also
oh i love a flirter
talk about that
okay...
there was a lot of pressure to be artificially emotionally open in that. there was a release in freedom in that which took a bit to figure out. that and she started to do drugs which kinda hurt to see. tbh i don't even remember what i told you
presenting is fun!
high school me was cool. i like high school me. bit of a dick but eh, everyones a bit of a dick.
you have the cash to travel to cali stuck?
i hate this professor so much btw
that reminds me of my first hs history teacher that just posted as much stuff as possible on each chapter that we covered and really tried to get us into the feel of the time period and region that was the subject
waffles or pancakes
he effed an underaged student
plus i got stuck
yay my uk friend finally woke up
i remember one time a kid pushed his pregnant gf down the front steps at the school
caffeine is a drug
those are the best easymode wings you can get your hands on with thorium
this mod also had a mini ice biome
i'm not really a fan of the author of overhaul btw ida
and we're still in easymode
we need to defeat him so that i can get bronze alloy fragments from the marble enemies
but why will it be a pain to me specifically?
probably won't be as useful because of overhaul.
we died so many times to it
also this is gonna be the last boss
damage?
what?
what if they're tryingt to destroy the world?
then they're a very messed up family
minus ore seeds.
well yeah
what's the damage like?
i got lucky with most of my accessories
i'll probably be able to get to about 54 or so by wof.
is master the most powerful he can be so far?
we're not going to use old copper tools
sorry for leaving all of a sudden btw but gtg, good planning session
do you drink cold water then?
also shutup squid
but, it’s pizza time now
nah i don't feel like keeping track
if you know you definitely took everything, try to think about other things
episode 2 predicted episode 3
i question if ida ever watched myself
what other browser would u use?
i will show you the cock
come join
i didn't know that you were you
i'm tired >.>
same
what in the heck is going on
hes been like a borther to me
a true family
your name has baconator in it.
depends on what kind of cheese i guess. i havent tried every single type of cheese so i cant say for sure
it's a little cream-cheesey if i recall
remember the great story?
....
i'm not trying to sound offensive but y'all seem kinda trict
shadow left
i’ll make the knife go away
i've only seen up to the jar of dirt movie
both probably
now that you say it, we'll probably get raided, dragonite
porates
habanero sauce
prepare to salivate
i have it once a week
ate 1/3 of the one in that photo during dunch today
shit
what?
i mean, i would just go and consider that an alt by technicality, but details
side note, i made the deans list o:
sooooo
im constantly on here and not even up to date on the spreadsheets i made for one of the classes. not doing anything officially extracurricular.
if i get nitro
i poked my fan with a pen and it stopped not running
...my computer died again
and so i just go on rotten tomatoes to laugh at the results
flubs are you done with your new intro?
what would be the offchance of the magikarps having absurdly high speed stats <:kappa:374346980136058893>
remember i even asked you if you would give a second chance
the bad end
because she did the forcing/blackmail
let's just say it had blackmail in it
i meant blackmail becoming blackma- shit nevermind that doesnt work
and i actually am friends with her bestie as well...soooo awkward
wait you guys actually think that's actually that bad?
it's worth a try
that’s just really black and white to see it
i see her bestie giving her a second chance though from what i have seen
realistic is the solution
i never show it though because i just mess around here
i love old warfare over modern warfare
ww1 and ww2 were interesting thoughn
oh trench warfare is wasy to understand
the sad part is, the businessmen back home were profiting from all this
wooden ships
the civil war is so interesting, i really enjoyed reading about it
oh yeah just like ww1
and early modern
peter the great
previous mistakes were repeated
yeah thank god the uk believed in churchill
he never was a miltary genius
his generals did everything for him
but they had the big bad usa on their side
i can't at this point master
dont get civ 6
yeah so
>that moment when you realize the devourer of gods stands for dog
i got tired of the lead devs immaturity
it was probably the fries that gave you away
i was expecting ice cream tho tbh
this video i’m working on is probably taking longer than anything else i have done
i’m tired
~~you probably think all war movies are amazing~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
more disappointed than previously i'd like to assume
haha! you cant block me if i destroy the discord servers!
while, i take less classes these classes somehow managed to be longer.
we're most of the way to forging a second terra blade
there's nothing to do in that game
the elder dragon
teh bass on the right?
although i just lost connection
also, did you try fighting skeletron already?
<#311402910820859914>
i need the sleep because of college 😑
good time of day.
sounds comfortabale for the eyes
e!says-add i don't know what to do, its working!
whats the screenshot keybind again
if i wasn't, we wouldn't have been able to beat the bosses.
it's fine, wolve.
not like the npc is going to be useful to us now
i also got a granite boombox.
i only found one shield in the dungeon by the way.
actually, i think i might have gotten one of those.
i'm kicking overhaul out for the next server
forget it ida
i don't think we could even attempt doing death mode
-calamity
-elemental unleash
-spirit
and better bard bits would've helped me do better too. <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
we didn't have a flat world
hmmk i remember chippy just standing next to the tail and using a sword that lowered defense
not even close.
the end items you get from it are op
i've been attempting to dig trenches to stop it spreading to the other half of the map
like the soc.
yeah, that
ah yes, the bees.
krelian, please. ^_^;
it used up every single free bit of space on my drive
yes play the terraria
taking a break from playing 2 hours of blazblue.
bella, the tutorials are completely optional and you can do them in any order.
:lul:
mine just talk shit
~~pancakes? so akechi is in your mind?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
this morning the same was true for me but that was because i'd just been feeding the sheep
ok i got panda set up
oh fuck
canterlot equestria
i can imagine the banner having stickfigures in it now
besides the memes
it's follow
im not making another.
...on
i'll tell you about flubs pm
crashed.
i'm guessing the notes are "poking ida = getting stabbed," good to know
i don’t wanna get slaughtered
it takes...a lot...to make me hate someone
i just dislike everyone else
that didn’t take a lot
and bramble i guess but i bought that like 5 seconds before we won so it didn't count
totally didn’t <:lul:305559915714576385> 
yeah pretty much. well in the semester at least. i work mon-fri when i’m not in school.
good job
the second semester uno distracted me
hey they are stupid enough to taunt the bull on the streets
....
i have a russian accent except for when i dont which is 99.99999% of the time. i can only do it when i screw up when i try to speak english while translating from russian while talking to parents
you have a biased sample
hey i made more noise than 30 kids in that theatre
no the google thing
it’s not
it was avoided not because of me
speaking of playing, we just beat plantera in our game
bass
just walk away slowly, animal man.
its a rating of how often something appeas within a given set
not that, you ninny.
i am slowly learning more on how to talk like her
ayyyy
cosplay as rarity
and say "thats what i was gonna do"
i have no idea who that is ida
caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
heartgold and soulsilver
not pirated blame drago for that
it's pokemon black and white and according to drago black and white was amazing
put it in the r4 card thing slot
he lost full control when my channel got banm
but i take the blame
3 things survived
what
or paying a lot of attention to something.
press f to pay respects
i like booping now
sorry
sorry
that profile pic is me now
rc wanna see the full pic?
if you wanted to put on makeup that implies you don't have any makeup on.
nooooo ida
i don't even wear glasses, i just think it's a fucking dumb reason to dislike something without giving it a chance
good luck on that
yeah sure go for it
what do you think star trek even is
some dude with long ears walking around
close enough
cuz y'know
flubs
i'd volunteer to do that but i'm too lazy
yeah that means you're doing it right
i forgot
here, i have one
well, it's platantly ripping off....
he’s play but he does similar things that eyan does and says word for word whatever he said on the video
good night ida
gummy dont
i will have to destroy you if you praise ttg again
can i say i’m really excited for the teen titans go movie?
why would you dare
oh dear . . .
i’m pretty sure none of us have wives, flubs
i’m still demisexual straight btw
i can’t show it to you
it’s because it’s actually detailed lewd made for gummy
like idk
gummy i read a story where fluttersy gets kidnapped and turned into a sex slave then is tortured into becoming a sex addict, i think whatever is in your story is fine
no cadance i haven’t
nope
he also is attracted to me
yeah its mlp related
oops i typed in "wondercraft" and now i'm seeing a bunch of minecraft stuff
now i can be the vulgar asshole i want to be
that isn't me
nope. not once
bollocks
oh fuck
nooooo
who gets it?
owo drago hitting his bad bot with a rod
i just told you guys yesterday
get the traitor
“the fact that you were trying to make it scary is the cute part” - my friend
he just doesn't have a shirt on.
ok format spiced the level up spreadsheet a bit
i assume this gilgamesh dude is your waifu ida
(also it's not real love, it's a fictional character for crying out loud)
its in
husbano is for females waifu is more male
are you talking to me in the last message flubs?
and who cares if it’s fictional
try a battle potion maybe?
wanna make me not a rough draft but a perfect version of a bio for my twitch?
tackle and surf
and...splash
i see.
that is why
and hey a new person
the paul brothers are loud. you want more of them?
hmmmm
fear
idk none of them ever sign up for my forums
they just subbed to me and followed me on twitter
yeah, it does have a nicer ring to it
makes me feel like i accomplish something
~~ill have fun hehe~~
it’s crazy
yeah, i could only think of like one legendary that required both versions to get, and that was rayquaza
good
i am tempted to add you now so you can meet them if you know which one it is
i play melee tank most of the time
did we download anymore mods
ho-oh
in her defense cabbage burger sounds really, really awful
money chest
no because isnt that you
and than just use one of the other picks till we have enough for another one <:lul:305559915714576385>
butt is the most important organ
is this something you have personal experience with flubs
when women were only valued for their birthing skills
well not only birthing
i'm just going to go listen to my favourite russian song
though i really like ivan the terrible
he didnt make the song...
and it wasn't made for him
and now they exist again
you know who was also a good tsar?
peter the great
they just don't have electricity in the siberian areas where it's happening <:keepo:327304799919800321>
i subbed in for flubs since he had a disability
you were like
i already explained it to like idk
panda hit me with a bat pls
but nah, gummy, as much as you want to help everyone, remember that it isn't your problem, as bad as that sounds
jeez i didn't make much progress there and i'm already feeling tired
i.e. spreading jungle to fix our corrupt jungle issues.
the way overhaul changed picks annoys me like how it annoys ida
i think the old tremor guy stole the sprites btw
antiaris is being made by the official tremor team.
but tremor itself is being maintained by someone else.
super balanced
it sends out an expanding wave that pierces
the hallowed megaphone
i saw that they received a massive rework on the wiki.
i might've forgotten the recipe
that's peanuts at our point in the game.
only beaten the blizzard boss in hard mode.
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
midnight?
yeah i'm still in pre hardmode atm
well i guess we could get you light discs or bananarangs.
i think that's calamity
i’ve had to take several exams at 8am
a rarity plushie and a tricorne/bicorne hate
a game about exploding things with magic
(the one problem with that is i'm trash at modeling robots)
idk never played it either lol
i'm at1038.
its gotta be true
drago these are one of the few times that it is necessary
not really.
i thought panda meant me for a sec lol
you forfeit your right to be acknowledged whenever you say the word "punny"
i haven’t played overwatch in a while
it amazes me how you guys can keep track of all of that
our generation is stupid
seriously, do people just have the inability to use their fucking brains
my favorite kind of idiot is the guy who goes on webmd and is convinced he has x horrible disease. what the doctor says doesnt matter. he has it. minor foot pain after hurting your foot? brain tumor. ate too much and your stomach hurts? 5 ulcers.
not due to some new revelation or anything
no i dont that one is advil
theyre probably dosed with laxative
do not participate in the life ruining juice
yeah, that might be treason
<:redditsilver:383343161356976128>
henlo wolve
yes.
why eggplant?
now the npc is attacking me for no reason : (
i'll record a gif of it once i get it looking nice
ban them
only it was for like 10 minutes
good night
again
then fix it
rarity pkushie made in the uk
especially since they make ones not in the uk
at least say she
you know
<:swolo:405120728074289204>
classmate rolled his truck after drinking and driving
i lived my life trying to get good enough that i would be worthy of her
when you least expect it
you would justify it
everyone said it
what cadance said is exactly what i thought
not the fictional one
and everything was so good for those few months
so that's a valid reason to be late with videos.
just not as much as actual smoking
feelsfrogman
i need to go to class in fifteen minutes
everybody do the flop
physics is evil
what
yeah, why?
just get one person to hold it and stand around a bunch of life regen things in base
hello.
im bored
~~no you cant~~
revo emag
honestly knowing me since i can’t fit a mlp song actually i might but i am leaning towards a military song
since my escort is also my classmate so we have to switch around when it’s her turn plus let’s say something embarrassing does happen you wouldn’t have to worry because you don’t know anyone there
just stand there while everyone dances
of course they do
that's not pony stuff
no, it is literally the opposite
glhf
you know rainy is right flubs
i reversed your message
yeah i get that, still mad at him
i still need to get to level 50...
hgss is my favorite remake
lmao
brb banishing myself
b/w was meh. the sequels are much better. x&y was bland. oras, i like but i definitely prefer emerald.
in the newer generations they kinda made red a pushover
platinum was the last game to have it
that’s photoshop
gummy its totally bc its you
and i still haven’t quit
at least she thinks im lovely
we all did
fleshlight
and maybe add a feature to have us remove them without having to go into the logs
now i'm trying to figure out all the quote from me.
not me.
you hate this place flubs
what other incredibly mundane questions can i search for in google
what rhymes with orange?
that's the smell of nature, you fool
i'm the drama queen here
ahem ahem *cough* enlightened ahem *cough*
im almost tempted to rebrand now but have no idea what it would be to
coffee drinker
i would work overtime for the computer to mod terraria
oh alright i’ll just go with bsing
how much in total?
even the decent ones are just not realistic
i do need to buy all the episodes one dat
ok now to actually shut off the battle station
i kind of gave up once i realized i'm the ranger and ranged weapons drop my fps to shit
it just might overhaul though.
it's worth a shot, at least
sorry.
i love collosseum and gale of darkness
they aren't perfect games, but they deserve more love than they get.
that's a good idea.
i just think time travel is a little too complex
snow
sounds interesting
i used mainly jgrasp.
how'd you even get it?
they charge money for use of the mods content.
true
ehh effort
having absolutely no idea what a thing is supposed to do then wasting 10 hours figuring it out when it was right in front of you the whole time
and i’m not learning anything except how to be really lazy 😛
i made a thing
reee
no better
so if i had to guess
well thats on you for not seeing the future to this exact moment at age 6
currently alone in a very empty quiet hallway
save the portal for next time
nothing happen to me
good to hear
that's what i'm currently doing, anyway.
you know me
i am glad
college
and i've taken 3 different trig classes
wonder woman and 2/3 of the dark knight trilogy
honestly i’m not as big of one but i’m excited for captain marvel
i did haha
sorry at the register
never watched the emoji movie before
i bet you can't wait for the next 14
2 was meh
is because disney owns them
don't forget her cousin
almost 1/3 of the way there
hmm?
label?
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
gotta go fast
why would we stop this beautiful thing

i’m still not there...
i’d recommend it
beacuse i am mad
your feet
yeah me trying to pogo myself onto my desk using one hand
my sister has noticed that i have weird friends
also insane
making flubs regret having faith in humanity, you can do quite well
gummy what you gotta do is get close to the person, then once you learn about their weaknesses just take them apart point by point until youve deconstructed their whole life
he likes the taste of face
dragonite
aram lul
it’s fun
how do you do that thing where you split the sheet in half in google docs so taht you can have two columns of text on a page?

a rydon
kappa

<:kappa:374346980136058893>
black and white really are the most divisive pokémon games. you either love them and they’re your favorites or you despise them
there are a couple things i wish were in them that were in the originals
also, it felt like they were changing things just to change things
i have to leave the room before i start yelling at him or worse
you are not, you delusional bird

why is there an actual currency based on garlic bread
garlicoin, actually
and my sister’s dog was making a lot of noise cleaning itself so that didn’t help
yes and no
i don’t like just having spaghetti
how the hell did you get that
i really question the use of math sometimes
i'm not going to be using this crap anytime soon
you're gonna need to be using problemsolving
because i'd like math to teach me the practical aspects of it, and then have something else give me critical thinking skills
what is with all of the icons
also why gummy why
i always have the second taskbar off on my other monitor
but im not about to fucking wall mount a third
i have tons
since adobe is being a jerk and is charging monthly
they weren't stupid enough to not learn from their mistake tho
wait they finally took cs2 down frmo their web site?
i'm just so used to photoshop from my high school animation class
cs4 might've been the latest version i used
so you are all time travellers?
is rarity an old lady confirmed?
y'all just hatin
and cadance we already have gummy we don't need more ponnies
my picture is gary busey, flubs != gary busey
i don't think skarm cares enough right now, as usual
no you aren't
"there's no reason to quote me"
i can't stand that stuff
i just wear shoes bigger than my foot
im 5 11 but have tiny hands and feet
what is spelling
that’s not a lot
i'm guessing a lot
my parents dont know what patreon is and that';s probably a good thing
i know, with the money i have, if i had to start paying rent and other payments, i wouldn’t have any left
i was responding to stuck's last message to me
i need to go do homework and discord is too distracting
squid just dont believe in it
oop gf is home gtg for a min

urgh, i should sleep too. but this is the first time ive gotten to write real code in a few days and i'm trying to fight the withdrawal
brb screen break
greetings, cadance.
it's not too big a deal just annoying
enlightened has right to read message history, but i'll give him earthbound just in case to avoid this in the future
more?
a gif, i guess
i see.
i could be from a 70.80 to a 55
bio final
so much homework
get to it
now those shifts are fucking awful
...what?
because i know for sure no one will get it right, even flubs
if mr cadance ever asks me again why i like rarity, i got a list.
if things end up going to hell when you and cadance have that chat, then i'll just pin it on dragonite
annoyingness
yeah i heard about it from a friend
demonlord: yeah thats right
i might end up with a 50 something in bio today as well
may 29

<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
ughhhhhhh
and i already got her real name it's ann
or maybe it was alyssa
i meant in terms of design.
that's a good question, why is that there
how about, god save everyone else because we're going to need it
like
mine would be a remix of nuclear fusion.
i was expecting skyrim but ok drago
god this part is hard
botw, the yiga clan hideout in gerudo
its not like exp decays
fuckit im gonna try it
then again i prefer this purple
the windows 10 hard drive wants to confirm alll the integrity stuff, exactly as expected
oh no im not brave enough for politics
my gpu is 80 degrees c but the case is freaking freezing

crashed
i can't find the one i knew about
but yeah im done finals and stuff

it reminded me of you
i'm not going to be held responsible for the death of the bot
the best i got are cookies, and i'm not giving you any
what the hay
yeah where is gummy?
too late
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
never have
spaghetti
noms threadripper
if you need more than that i dont know what the fuck kind of game youre trying to run
it's not that bad
better?
some previous test subjects have been able to. others not so much
damn it
"the funeral is at 6:00, please be on time"ypoo

but tbh bill is a basic boring name
my real name is boring
chad from accounting?
"everyone involved in the project died."
than again i wasn't too surprised when i learn drago's name
besides that dude from pokemon
i kinda am
well ida we are nice siblings
a nintendo port to pc will be the day
doesnt help me figure out who tf owns the discord beta testing server tho
and yet somehow the hard drive isnt even 75% filled after 6 years
im soon gonna start dumping a lot of my stuff onto the pentium that we have and is like 80% empty of a 1 tb
owo this is interesting
great now i have self-confidence issues
at least im still not confused. benifits of not thinking
"genious"
one of my favourite medieval/renaissance songs
maybe it was like a proto-proto-proto-proto-proto-proto phonograph and they just slapped on the video later
into everything...
hey gummy want to do my physics homework
i want a muffin
thats all i want
real white chocolate chip muffins are chocolate muffins with white chocolate chips inside
the case shouldn't affect your flash drives like that
but when you type `main` in with a capital m you need to manually input {} later on for your code to run
well its coated in tea
achievement unlocked: use calculus for a homework problem that probably didn't require calculus
not entirely sure why that needed to be pinned
im a rock

and i hate you
i assume you are talking about your grandma, and if you really want her to shut up ask her about m-81
ok but you still got spaghettified
can confirm
how about that weather?!
so what it’s my part
or would that one warrant the gpu approach?
ill do that tomorrow so i get some sleep.cycle(time) today
you need a 3ds and money
no no those can stay
i dont want those nsfw ones tho
<:treason:396483914803445761>
it’s still treason
i love cookies... but in consolation here’s turnovers for dessert
that was her ice cream
for my own sake lmao
a pint is a good "i have 10 minutes and feel like destroying myself" snack

mmmmmm the ground
all other languages are inferior to vb
i'm honestly more excited for that time around since i'll be playing gunner xp
not even kidding.
i don't want there to be too much lag
i consider is a quality of life mod
and that's just one item.
nice
can't too tired
👋 bye bye overhaul i never want to see you again
yea, i'll do my best to design the base better this time.
those were neat.
well we're getting i-frames back since we're uninstalling it
i had it backwards.
yeah i was wondering before when you first said it
<:lul:305559915714576385>
eew gross why do you have poewrpoint and onenote pinned
not bad
most of this quarter's assignments were about an event based on floating marbles on tin foil
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
in a holy shit my mouth is burning but i'm also hungry kind of way
its a really fun game
oh wait i figured out why eyan doesnt have the crown next to his name. he has the `@eyan` role, so it doesnt bother
fibus lusec wecos vinosec
there is no longer a crown when theres an obvious admin role...
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
imagine that
like i said
thats that to none
and while they use modern guns they actually wear colour uniforms
anyways got my cutie mark idea down
owo what kind of school is this
i needed that after dinner snack
now it's a force schedule your video
thats how you are supposed to upload now on twitch i gues
how many views
because you two were having a ban fight
thats twitch, rc
everything?
the thumbnails for the events are jpeg only and are like 600x500
thats how many pirate hunters there are left
i think i canm adjust the countdown
why does dragonite need to be the one to do it?
ida calls that targetting and stuff
the darling and kiddies ides
now if only i can pronouce darling
we already know what you're gonna pick tho
well i already say muskets anyways so i choose darling of course
rc, squid, master, wolverale, and draco helped me with this one
not that wand, ,flubs
old timey pistol also seems balanced tho, bc you take a lot of time to load it and it isnt accurate, but still a gun
this will be very limited
at least bring a few useless bois with you then
its a sword, how can it fit into a little hard drive?
this is shaping up to be a good story, i don’t feel powerful
i also get my ass beat my the main villain in the final battle
good
this is the kingdom of zeal
glhf
hey, i need that to breathe
i’m not uploading to twitch anytime soon, so it doesn’t bother me
and my most viewed video has over 13,000 views
even with a job
so i don't have to do that ^^^
you already do, ninny
so has anyone heard about the upcoming mario movie?
here is the gun
they're just going back and forth with this
you know, i haven’t leveled up in a while
!rank
indeed
ugh why do i have to groom myself and not look like shit
how are you guys doing ^w^
doing well.
*pokes gummy with a stick* xd
stuck why would ida do that to me?
do you think ida hates me?
also i came very close to mistyping "weilds ass" which would be a sight to see
what kind of sword is it?
probably could but this dress is expensive
i didn’t buy it
i would like just enough to be higher level than gummy
my intro is pretty good
lapel
i mean boo
yay the plushie empire is now the sharing lewd pics empire
you are not joining
i do
that doesnt answer my question
<:lul:305559915714576385>
should i get nitro?
how does that look?
why do i have the bad feeling he's going to abuse that emote
you didnt change your number tag yet
:spinning: x3
<a:spinning:395030946921054208>
it's not this video is a test run master

suddenly, rainy.
they gave zoo empire an 80%
i wonder if "greater masa mune" will ever be a thing. <:thinkingking:325447327940870145>
yeah, that's an image i'm going to need to bleach out of my head
followed by a picture of felix that my better judgement tells me not to post here

i'm afraid to join vc xp
it's fun
oh jesus
how dare somebody play my champ

you killed my father
when
ever put a mint in your mouth, throw out the wrapper, and then regret every choice in you life as you wade through the fucking trashcan so you can spit the disgusting, horrid, satanic waste of glucose into the wrapper?
basically a color override.
and i’m sure this could add fuel to that fire
i see.

<:yep:318920218279673856>
did you see the pic rc?
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
i'm surprsied i didn't go to such lengths myself dealing with frontier's crap
in the emote name.
wasnt an issue yesterday or before tho for some reason...
the world doesn't revolve around you, gummy.
heh heh
ask master
he’s going to die
wait thank god squid is now pink
i don’t have flubs calling me brother
get the chat to fight and blow things up
it is
and the other is a date with a musket
remember magic wand
that or angry ida at gummy for some reason
dude ida willl question it tomorrow
~~dont worry squid, i never will.~~
henlo shade
good
flubs is great
flubs
i love hnnngggg-ing
hi squid
i imagine flubs would spontaneously combust whenever he opens his mouth and a word comes out
test
that too lol
i arrive back
i return
figured out how to make a brachistochrone in excel
but for now that'll have to wait
oh hai
brb life
*paints over twitch* did it help?
eating
pokes gummy
duke nukem reference.

nothing, like that
oh hey, you're dunban now, rc?
well go nom something
particularly the bones part
and yay
you are not worthy
i will not stay calm
ill link ones that i see
i was about to link that...
how do chips get priority over wifi
another eagles touchdown
yep just heard my dad freak out about it lmao
and suddenly gummy just got off the death penalty. he played you, squid
darn
my tradition is just not watching the game
e!bot
trimming takes too much effort
ohh my head hurts
skarm wants to fight?
i tried
damn misspelling...
don't beat my sis
so before i went to sleep today i figured out the formular to graph a brachistochrone and ive also added 2 new features to the bot
guess i am a female
skarm is always either violent or lewd, i'll have you know
so do i get one ?
"greater masa mune" was the purple override.
they look like they’re supposed to be shopkins, but toilet-matter themed
if i was going to get an emote it should be more me this time
what game is it?
hates chem
we did it guys
adventurous
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
a bit of both?
still due
^ dragonite quote not mine
watch it be the worst character in the game
no its a color
~~what if you don't know what race you want to choose, wolve?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i like using a sword and a healing spell
even if he was a melee guy during the mage quests
i just smashed him since my first character was built to kill mages
i don't really have any followers tbh lol
dammit (follower name here)
he's too busy spending two thousand hours in terraria
same
it's fun
plz repeat stuff
he's trying to get in my ear
*you got me* shut up thoughts
and just got to supersonic
they let you on phones last year in spare
being an administrator isn't easy at all.
a group dm ida
plus a server which is connected to the dm
i measured my cup
well there was one that came from dragonite that was punctuated.
knew that was going to happen
or twenty
nvm just throwing it on the spreadsheet
my catchphrase is better
pot meet kettle, gummy
that's not good news
ok i got a new email to redirect all my college spam to... took me long enough
i need advice on this....
reminds me of myself
i never guilt trip you
do people ever come back??
6 questions
best i can do is 4.5 questions
notice the "man"
did i just walk in on something here
it’s annoying to the bot that animal man is a guy?
i eat babies
oh wow almost like i have experience being an asshole
i'd say around 3.28
i might end up leaving
but not here i need you
you gotta sometimes make the call that a community would be better off without someone weighing it down. that's not a decision you should have to make frequently nor take for granted but sometimes it's what it comes down to
at this point, i'd just let them tear each other to pieces. if it's being straining to your health, it's probably the better initiative to leave
no no lets
okay well now she msg the dm and idk if i wanna say anything or keep quiet
but drama is fuuunnnnn
thanks
or pregnant luigi
goood gummy
im no friend of his
“borderline”
i wanted to be blue :c
but until that day
never most likely
the adage is "half your age plus seven"
plantera is one of the bosses and you break a plantera bulb to summon it.

okay jumbalaya
there it worked
i see then...
why skarm why?

officers!
my singing needs work on
um thanks rainy
how goes things?
they’re well. just waiting  to get to my stop for the subway
how are you?
it takes a lot most to understand, but you have much more control over what things do.
`private final boolean masterisabutthead=true;`
because flubs is more fun
i'm not fun
darn i thought it was genetic
<:lul:305559915714576385>
not that one
partnership for peace?
not true;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
i probably have a cs, latin, and pre-calc test all tomorrow
whats a study?
oh, and there's also the devotion of time and attention to acquiring knowledge on an academic subject, especially by the means of books.
enforce strict equality throughout the entire source code.
could be worse rares
like how spanish is very useful here in the us.
and that too
i had one once
wasted over 10 hours reuploading episode 11
it was at first
wow before premiere it had quality options
keyword: should
if you're going to show me bull videos gummy, then no
irl, i have no patience
it’s weird if you ask me. not as bad as garbodor, but still
i will never understand why anyone like it. unless you are a poison type lover
anyone here have a good recipe for pizza sauce?
i prefer putting ice type moves on water types.
i think i am seeing things
i think ida doesn’t like me now 😛
probably but gummy is known for being solo and lonely
no one talks to him
ida what else do you thinki do that’s a waste of time?
only 75 hours?
i just got the game like a month ago

dazzling is next at school then
doesnt mean he cant react with them
i love my new vocab

i think the bot is a bit drunk right now
im drinking whiskey

hello

i thought it was fairly obvious :c
nice
brb looking up how many joules are spent in an hour long bike ride at fifteen mph
youre still weird though
i reset the game
why are we listening?
programmer art sound effects
new super mario bros ds was another option but i done the let’s play 4 times and it requires the bot screen
i knew drago made money
who blows themselves up with a lucky 7?
nice original tileset :^)
i didnt do an analysis but it happened to me two or three times
i need to next gen or i am gonna perpetually upset him
youtube/twitch

just my mom....
it’s been more than 15 seconds since he last said something
i like ketchup on cheeseburgers
drago
so i just made some more pure gb today
later
sure, give me a minute.
whelp.
you think we should hold off for updates?
*we here at the kingdom of zeal discord server do not condone the act of defecation on people of power, like kaisers for instance. we will not be held liable if you do end up attempting and/or succeeding in these acts.
archive them somewhere or something
time in woe is rarely solitary, since you usually end up having to explain yourself to one or more of the gurus
and i want to say there was another that i'm forgetting about.
i’m nit picking probably haha
close
since joe is a euphemism for coffee and all
im also liking ginger tea
im allerguc
your advice worked
same person, gummy?
how do you add water cooling to a bot
you didn't ask for a good explanation
in that case the response wouldve been very carefully
also kicking the creator of the bot on that server isn’t a good idea as well
welcome to zeal simulator 12kbby
use sylveon lol
no squid that’s inappropriate
huh?
drago loves me squid
however if i do choose a new pokemon it will be oricorio
we are thinking of different kinds of pancakes.
gummy can you nickname a pokémon after me
said you were
i wasnt even home
no dont expect nothing. expect idiocy and explosions.
less than 100 that’s for sure
and they want to outplay inflation in profits i think
i gave flubs rice with vinegar
his name is jonathon, tyvm
gimme a sec ill find it
or just the anniversary of my username
no 5th supergummying youtube anniversary
ironically, the first time i watched basketball was the 2004 olympics where the us team lost <:lul:305559915714576385>
i guess i missed the part where dragonite's name was changed to 'screw you master - guru of screw'
until you quit this server?
that costs money
and hey you have bad apple yay
why do i have to be john...
ahh starting week count on monday
all the mods are gone
what’s your favorite sport in it?
oh yeah gymnastics
i like the diving events too
drago
yeah
i mostly paid attention to ice skating
they're so pretty
some of them are obviously better than others
everyone will be insulted at your screwing up
i did something i regret so much
because youtube
imgur link?
too late already posted things in a lewd channel in another server
i mean gummy is innocent
or g if youre going greek
we need another red to advance to masa mune
looks like you screwed it up
making sure htis still works

but yeah that was fun
what? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
<@&413155708100411393> here tomorrow
well no one would agree to it hence why i said other holiday events

i know rc thats why nothing bad should happen
you should get that fixed
im too busy trying to sing chant du départ
<:treason:396483914803445761>
i mean if worse comes to worse (i have no idea if i used this right or if it's written properly) you could always use the *"legal"* roundabout method of installing windows. although, idk if you can do that on a laptop.
well it’s an impacted major

whelp.
also happy valentines day and happy singles awareness day! :seoxyslove:

okay then
nope
<:treason:396483914803445761>

there's another good response
<:lul:305559915714576385>

it's not that, it's just that my internet is going to make things a pain because of constant buffering

good job
this is what i look like
im gonna change my profile picture to what i look like when gummy changes his profile picture
whenever people ask me whether they should do this or that in a video game i know nothing about, i tell them to "follow your heart" works every time <:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
drago abuse your powers
oh man we're havin' steak for dinner <:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>

（。_°☆＼(- – )
well don't throw up in here
~~cut it off to spare the pain~~
i kinda had freaked out again...
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>

i think it might be for the upcoming underground boss
i don’t speak in cursive
explanation please

wait shit i firgot to approve all these first
the battle is starting soon
so gummy doesn’t know how to fix things apparently
yup who knew making a group chat was so hard...
pick a vacation area i should go to
sonanoka~
frickin captain colours sounds better than that
the princess of snow
actually better than what you called me yesterday
it sucks you in, i know that from experience
i see.
so many scottish accented voices shouting "think you can take me?" in my head right now, this is normal
theres a few good ones tho
doujins, you say
i'm sure that music made by ordinary people has more passion in it
fair enough.
hey i nolife plenty
its 82 here or something
im one extra hour ahead of you, whatever that is
that sounds stupid
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
i hate burritos

my throat now really hurts
and gummy comedically misses the point.
at least make an effort lol
idk if i actually ever bear it or not
i never played colosseum d:
i spent most of my time on the internet on cartoon network and nickelodeon’s websites
i inherited my dad's steam account if that helps
are you texting and driving, first of all
you actually asked who the heck i was.
i can’t stay up for 24 hours
<:lul:305559915714576385>
not a name i recognize
live footage of eyan deleting friends
dude

<:hellothere:305560404715896832> dan
greetings, chewy.
what happened?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i mean where did you find the news?
i dont even remember posting that
wow i am not ban in his twitch chat
not a fan of steak either
i don’t see the appeal of bacon
i wouldn't willingly order it
i don't see anything wrong with pineapple
oh that?
rip lines
nice
like at all
you starting to suffer from sleep apnea?
strem
i thought you were homeschooled though

live is a cross between like and love
what is it?
that good?
e!dragonite-b
worth
raw fish?
awua
well the "ryzen 1600" is specifically the cpu of said computer.
because i remember there was one point that eyan was trying to be a summoner and was looking for a slime staff.
i question how effective that solution is
~~set it on fire~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
and that’s not green
gummy prefers green?
pay eyan $5 and that'll be a yes
i mean there's probably a way to program the bot to remove reaction if it was added by someone else
<:treason:396483914803445761>
but it’s nasa
eyan is the best king in the world, god save the king!

you have to look really close and cross your eyes and poke yourself in the face with the arrow tip
i was only 1 then

~~so, if you want to have sex with the himalayas, then that makes you himalaysexual~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>

i mean uh

brb doing garlic bread cinematography

well i get it
thanks guys now i want to make metroidvania games

jere
is it behind the church
maybe they used a bonneton taxi to move it there
a crane
that's navi, not toad <:kappa:374346980136058893>
"hey!"
it's referring to samus' mother-like position with the baby metroid.
and no, mother 3 is not confirmed
it’s delightful
it's like that one tradition where an idea has to be approved while both drunken and sober to go into action
i also like just drunk ideas in general
ah hell i forgot the flash was back on tonight
they could just be lazy as hell and just make it a 7th gen port
i'm calling a delay here, it still seems too early
she said its her first year

<:pcmr:305892755014418435>

wait i havent added taht
i have a windbreaker, warm af sweater, long sleeve, and short sleeve shirt all on rn and i just got out of the gym
it’s gummy!
good mentality
it is
each word drawn from a list of ~1 million
there are 9 words per sentence
ack, didn't copy.
"the short fortune-teller who escaped from prison was a small medium at large"
don't feel like changing that anyway
skarm, no.
what about a random pun generator?
i think it's 8
that wasn't a pun
hai everyone <:hellothere:305560404715896832>
mush is gross
<:doit:334014889137930240>
they're glitchy
and then all the frogs float into space <:kappa:374346980136058893>
or alternatively: looking at the abyss
now why would you do that
i'm still upset though
i choked on water
probably
to go to the water fountain
ok, i feel these hand quotes are popping up more than they should
where is he?
remove all the emotes from that comment that aren't eyan memes
yeah, pretty much
i'll keep my heart unsullied by such emotional torture
but fallout 4 really is better
you should be watching star wars
so get warm <:kappa:374346980136058893>
it fucking destroys your muscles though
dayum
i cant get food out of my fridge

oh darn i missed a stream
well this is interesting
whomst
possibly
this.dragonite()
again, are we dealing with the bot or gummy at this point
hey, i’m not the only one who dies here.
but there are two people dedicating their entire lives to fish
good
cosmic chicken
operation: poisoned chicken
xcom
it's been fantastic
oh i didn’t mean it like that
thinking like a game designer
they're waiting for andi to donate so they can ban gummy.
honestly i kinda believe andi would do something crazy like this
i'd pay money to ban this entire server just because i enjoy anarchy
"shouldn't you be making headlines by now?"
"i'd rather be in the obituaries."
i won't be able to disconnect the two for my entire playthrough
the end
idk about that one, my auto teacher approves of cars 3
this is one of my favourites, because princess
from what i heard, she was a no-show sunday. she first called and said she couldn’t work, she got a court summons. but, the supervisor who answered the call called her out and said that the courts are closed on sunday
not for another two months
besides undying love for pregnant luigi and luigi x mario fanfics
until today
~~are we eating chicken?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
what are we preparing it for?
how dare
but are we eating the chicken?
i changed my mind
oh right, there's a direct today.
who needs one of those
the date
no, i’m string asquid = “squidofbaconator”;
im weird
a little bit of both i’d say
i don't see them bringing back pokémon trainer
<:lul:305559915714576385>
iirc
*burns snapchat* there was no use to that anyways
master controls fibus
its a new record on the timer
even talking about treason is treason
okay was it the bot or the game that dragonite was referring to, in terms of the image.
flubs?
gather round gatger round i have great news
attention citizens of zeal
time to ask everyone to follow me
wrong person, damn you
i demand violence
my bad wrong server
dont you not though? isnt a thing with nitro that you can use any custom emote anywhere?
i should get it, but again...lazy
you can stop with your pickup lines now
i said dragon, not dragonite
england is next on the list, just be aware of their baguettes
jokes on you i have a neckbof iron
connection issues
wait a minute that’s my new slogan “gum is always watching”
definitely
it's just getting better and better.
i need protection
congrats
gen ii is still my favorite.
x&y has always been hated
hey gummy want to recant the tale of the fishing pole and you almost getting murdered with a guitar?
i love it when you guys think im crazy when i explain things put of context
however oil has prevented gummy from hearing much
modulo.
my phone...
oh and fries get a free pass ofc
only thing i care to eat from there is their pancakes, hash browns, and parfaits
i wanna get an inkay though
how do i hide channels again?
im trying to get a few people to expand their friend pool
i am
show off
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
i've redicovered one of my favorite forms of comedy.
i approve. =w=
i’ve only had sushi once in my life
besides olive oil in my ear
oooo i love that song
honestly maybe i do have a personality disorder
that's not fun
because it works
i have the sudden urge to open bot dot js and fix all of master's lousy formatting decisions
~~dragonite is *steamed* at steam.~~
this is true
it was funny
stall the battle for 10 minutes
we all know i wont but thanks
pretty easy to find
i'll try to look for it in that shithole called weeb chat
wait
you never talk to me
that's my job
maybe
just use a vacuum
(it's probably somewhere in my tornado zone of a room)
why do you keep shoving things down my throat?
it's code for "we're disowning the wii u and pretending it never existed"
$60 and i only played it for 5 hours
well today was a horrible day
yup master jinx me
ech!
semaphore.
that’s blitz’s thing
i haven’t been on in a bit
now how will i move
star wars isnt my favorite thing
to have something in common: to share the same interests ~~or have similar characteristics~~
thats not something in common
this is a mutual despise of the others interests
i despise it but i don’t fully hate it
woo, another computer issue solved.
is that the first action directed at wolverale, now
ok yeah thanks now leave
i ordered two...
ヽ(°▽ °)ノ
he had 5 arms minimum
mystery dungeon explorers of sky is stupid
hg/ss is so expensive. a new copy is $799

not dying guys
no keep watching my dude
no, no that's just a dumb excuse.
wait nvm he got caught more than once
wrong
is it part poodle part moth <:kappa:374346980136058893>
hey will
did you see godzilla blow up the mailman?
the dog
a dog didn't explode the mailman though, a giant mutated lizard did
skarm sound the drums of war.... japan is going down
rest well then
get back here
maybe. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
bahhhhh
*struggles*.... hmm
its a psychic scream
i mean you get to choose
well
i dont know who exactly has the perms but youre the highest up thats online
thank you
time to level up
it probably won't, but it also probably will
he said go minimalist on it so it probably isnt gonna make it
helps*
well to his credit, master. the third most recent announcement in blackomen *isnt* explicitly stating that
i don't think it's much to ask for a little respect via the honor system.
ergo, he is better
try getting on my level (14)
error 251: insufficient quality of music found
and getting up at noon
really
wait isnt it like a lot less than halfway though
he won the biggest level up message war so far
i kind of don't hang out here anymore
i doubt he meant *those* kind of things, flubs
like
(◕ ε ◕)
which is rarity and she isn’t real soooo
well best girl
<:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>
whos that
well he's also not pink nu if that means anything <:kappa:374346980136058893>
against sivir azir rakan
i just wanna re sub then sleep
nice
i dont know how to respond
yeah wolve do that if you value your time sanity or happiness
tmw you have two monitors and wish you had three
there are 3 of us
sometimes it takes 2 seconds other times its like half an hour
oh, maybe
i know right?
few days later and i just remembered how bad it is
word of warning: around 90% of things on here is stupid. the other 10% is insane
hey man turn that frown upside down
i blame drago
it sounds interesting
theres nothing in the bullet
thank you
~~well she did or didnt so its obviously 50/50~~
also, i’ve seen double team umbreons
but double team umbreon just murders
those
i’ve been wanting to play emerald again. but, i’m not sure if i want to play with my copy or find a rom like sigma emerald or something
potentially
where's the 3rd guru?
i feel like it
not even an error?
i'm aware of that, skarm
yeah thanks
though i don’t think you will give me a wand
the part i don't understand is the system of magic used in chrono trigger
skarm does not want battle revolution
i played the crap out of this when i was younger
wh- oh. skarm is being punny again
n is awesome
colress is good
who knows, maybe the hate part is another reason why i like vanilluxe
i can keep talking shit about gen 5 <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i can also talk shit about gen 6.
now let's try this gif
that was a horrifying buildup
the one without profile pics
this isn't share your sidebar day
but it's toxic there
they bashed manechat all the time
good kob
i don’t like ghestsis.
everyone has trouble with ghetsis, i consider it probably the hardest fight in the series.
also ypure not supposed to like ghetsis lol
games done quick
it's 7:38 and i'm still in the same event that i was at noon
now to check if gpu prices dropped at all...
yup twitch support is on it
it already timed out
just think about flavors of pasta
those are tasty things which in this scenario overrules important
<:lul:305559915714576385>
^ this is really quiet
i’m listening to this instead of stephen&friends broken picturephone. what am i doing with my life?
what is with that background?
i used to be a fus, now im a dah
i’ll do that for april fools
it won’t cover up the name though
im never sane
does this place happen to have any sanity?
<:lul:305559915714576385>
the kappa
his name is hilbert, get it right
i will say, i loved chugga’s “hilbert” monologue in the 1st episode.
make that dark chocolate and i'm in
that's what i'm saying
back in albany he was teaching dance for 50-60 hours per week
welp
wait a second
holy shit there's actually people helpless hg me clean this year
<:yep:318920218279673856>
how can you be in a suit for 24 hours?
i was sleeping on the couch so i wasn't in a rush anyway
i thought it would fall to deci since youre not married yet
by the way you shoudlnt be drinking the water
let me count
well i once got my butt kicked when i played on emperor mode in civ
i didn't know it was difficulty
why have you been doing that up to now?
ask my brony friends
you didn't even get the joke.
and gummy's desires further worsen the situation
“more qualified individuals” who is qualified in shipping gummy with a fictional character?
my code isn't working and i have no idea whyyyyyyyyyyyy
it's supposed to work
beep beep
my mom’s birthday is friday
you're changing your name back to gummy? that's good news to me <:kappa:374346980136058893>
that took years to make
i have no idea what that's supposed to mean
but i play online, so i can’t pause
smirking got me to level up 😃
indeed, in fact that is typically all we use to communicate on this platform, are words words words (and the occasional emoji in the form of a reaction or one of those like o-o things
and they started asking me advice
nope
no skarm turn yourself in!
hahaha
eew social
dangit
you caught me
on another note, i still love puns
where you go around the corner and wait? <:keepo:327304799919800321>
only reason im not aggressive in civ was ida telling it’s not a good idea
it's just my alt dont get excited
yay!
(drago, put an icon on your alt, you lazy bum)
what drago said
gossip leads to bulli
since you said it was i said yeah sure let them in there
i return with cake
good job master (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
also wolve isnt that like the most boring part of the game?
math
pony fanfiction
i do pride myself on being open minded...
also my asshole friend is on vacation
i was never a true zealian
she plays a lot of characters besides twilight like timmy turner
i was actually going to ask her a questions but got scared
lol yup
2am and still not tired
well if he constantly says he’s 11 and to leave him alone because he’s young but acts like 11
i actually do have kicking powers and i wish i kicked him but he got ban instead on one server
if fifteen year old dragonite showed up here i probably would have banned him by now too
but er good thing all the lessons drago taught me flew out the other ear
okay, that was a lie
then i point you to r/choosingbeggars
i mean
nice
i hope i find someone someday who is extremely untidy and can't cook for shit
if i didn't hate the altmer so fucking much in the grand picture of the elder scrolls i'd me more inclined to side with the nords
botw > skyrim
ehh you capitalized it so my code says it's completely different
i could go for some java
oh hey, twitch unbroke
gkhf
one more week flubs
red wine?
welp
lmao
although for some reason the link to zeal palace doesn't work
why were we shipping me again
this is operation fat dragon
dismebarks
is steam age based on achievements completed?
well why didnt they do what they can do now
...can daggers?
theres *kinda* a third dimension
!image twitch lol
you scared gummy
fuck you, flubs
it looks like im saying fuck you to myself
what is wrong with me this week?
youre in love with a pony other than whatever that one is called
i think
i have no clue
and ew
oh they removed the ability to recently
twitter has a pretty garbage layout tho
yeah they gave me a full refund and yeah
nintendo should make all the main pokémon games available on either the 3ds/wii u virtual console or if the switch ends up getting a virtual console
sideways, dammit...
i used to store a lot of my gba games in my ds boxes.'
not eyan's basement you fool
okay, i just saw a skyrim mod that turns the dragon you find in helgan (the name escapes me at the minute) into charizard.
i wish i could.
he lost that match
damn
he subbed in for flubs with the village burning thing
ok hi bot
gummy what did i tell you about the laughing gas
ahh yes, the love triangle between the human, the robot and the whatever constitutes a flubs
<:lul:305559915714576385>
it’s when we aren’t here <:kappa:374346980136058893>
here we go
oh right tahts in unix
get rekt
should i set the starting counter to like 2?
get ida to help im lazy and tired
poke squid
don’t do it
skarm knows all
....drago
thank
but they are at war with me
well im france and france surrender after the napoleonic era
yeah i think it’s cool
inb4 it's a ragnarok drop
turns out, if the subs don’t watch x amount of videos as they come out, they just straight up don’t get notified of the video
something something ritual of the ancestor moth
no i noticed
i just dont recall the mini character items being thorious
i enjoyed my time with it, but not as much as other entries in the series.
what about the battle sprites?
i try to have a 10-7 sleep schedule.
you never sleep tho
i’d listen if i wasn’t in public
probably not
"manechat"?
though she got jealous of ida and a few other girls i talk to
gummy how many times do i have to describe "go up the chain of command" to you

i was referring to one of the early scenes where baby rodney was crying and they turned down the volume with a dial that was basically his ear.

did everyone hear what happened with doublelift
two wine glass
with real gold on them
my parents told me not to buy them much and to spend my money for myself but i was like no
it is but i will probably not go back to europe for awhile and the exchange rate is terrible in canada
that girl who spent $700 today spent $400 on one pair of shoes....
a guy i made friends with showed me the name im not in it
dessert
that looks like the bone meal
mm'hmm
nice
it's better than megashark but consumes more ammo
yes...our tour guide
didn’t you already do heartgold?
ha, it's right off of oak lane
best 8 hours of the day
i just found out about that
you just melted the pot
on it.
can't wait to get back on ethernet
*casts zone of truth as a 3rd level spell* what were you going to ask
depends on the weekday
well, chronomancer
actually, is it just rng farming? cause that's fine
have fun with the ragnarok
thunder wave is a really good move overall.
that's how much the game hates *everyone*.
i hope i get the writing right for my fan game if i ever make progress on that.
can you explain?
i never experienced the celebi event first hand because my parents didn't want to leave the house the day i wanted to go to gamestop to get it because it was raining
even a lot of people who don't like gen 5 like n
it’s more tutorial shit that’s stupid
my problem was we were getting a 3rd game too soon
i feel like most of the games since the beginning of gen 6 are rushed
~~and lags you if you don't have a good pc.~~
halfway to reddd
is this the game-wide record?
i love gossiping for some reason
how did i know that would get pinned? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
i think this is my first official gold item
felt like touhou on like, normal-to-hard
we can set a cooldown on it lol
need a one word synonym for controller
i assume for the video-game variety?
uhh what?
holy fuck everything in switzerland is expensive
our tour guide pretended his coat hanger was a magic wand today

whats the level cap in skyrim?
maybe the game hates me
yes considering i have spent a few nights up till 6 am setting up windows to be usable
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
yes, brad?
here's what i know regarding those 3 distros.
ubuntu - mostly right, but not necessarily windows style. it’s just very user friendly
i have... some chocolate chip cookies
sarah ghome food in mouth yay
i mean both types of scripts
why are they a thing?
quiet you
sure
i am so confused
ill get back to you after i see the tutorial on it
sleep is not a thing i got last night, bye
for the stream playthrough?
crashed again.
is frankfurt an hour drive from canada?
tour company said you must be “18”
no flubs
that stinks
it must have been tough adjusting to the time difference
oooh its a party in commons
dammit skarm
okie dokie ^w^
did someone say sleep until noon
i almost said detonator but thats silly the detonator is in the bomb
works like a charm
also holy crap youtube's autoplay algorithm is like 5 billion times better than their shuffle playlist one
im hungry
god admit swarm you failure
now i want to pull apart my laptop
i just wasn't aware of it.
you lack the required spacing
did you see drago?
whats with the face?
i would go
i would post pics but i don't feel like spamming creative
im gonna be hungry regardless
but they call it that
i will post more pics later
i’m glad i have this image saved 😛
for some reason i didn't see the reply.
rito?
and i already saw it a couple times. i am subscribed to him <:kappa:374346980136058893>
so must make an anthem
no they are pissing me off
all implies everyone's
in a friendly sibling way
i have a house in whiterun i think
i went on the side of the guy you almost watch die
they give you other buffs
the quest should still be in your to do list tho
isnt alduin really easy to kill though
and took the free money
she insinuated some very rude things about my ancestors being related
like...everyone knows the people all die so who gives a fuck
a lot of things
well, this was ~~boring~~ great. back to work...
i’m sure when i get back, it’ll be really busy. that’s how it usually goes
it's just convenient timing
ok heres a short summary
he got depression for a while but he has since recovered from it and has been streaming for most of that time, hes busy with a job rn but it is in future plans to overhaul youtube
scare sarah again
they have a food about it
pm me if you need anything
guess i can go with cozy mode for a while then
im getting work done, though it doesn't pay very much
screw it, not waiting for this to finish rendering, it's 1:23 in the morning and imma sleep bye
*sigh* i hate getting sick...
i’m just gonna put this here....
im not looking for ping time
i thought you could just type throw error into a function?

at least it kept recording
my league client has failed catastrophically
good job
which is a shame, means i missed out on pizza delivery sivir
do you have food
hey, i was going to eat that squid
okay, that's kinda great.
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
wolve, you're a grnius.
so it's a name pun.
uh oh.
point goes to wolveale.
:feelsannoyingman:
from shadows of almia.
oh, he used a buizel.
the main problems with the 1st one is that it’s too linear and you have to “capture” pokémon in one go, instead of filling up the bar
plus, you can’t take pokémon out of certain areas until post game. and the 2nd and 3rd games have side quests
~~but you could use psyduck~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
my team in platinum was infernape, abomasnow, floatzel, dragonite, and...  i don't remember what else i used since it's been years.
just make bidoof the best pokémon ever <:kappa:374346980136058893>
wowsa.
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>
later, squid.
oh okay
*sees new pin* <:lul:305559915714576385>
i thought they looked oddly reflective
because the lab wants me to
or just a generic outage?
boring
send help
yeah
yeah
and it uses jpeg images
its a collage of 3 images one of them being negated and all of them being mirrored diagonally
but why do physics gnomes make sleep?
i used excadrill in my black playthrough and i was quite happy with its performance.
terraria: a game a lot of people play that i have no interest in <:kappa:374346980136058893>
wish there was some way i could help.
you mean loot cubes with a mob spawner?
by the way, wolve.
i got a really good paxel and scepter.
because they feel like it
would be nice if those ideas got added to other games at least and then some sort of small tribute notes existing somewhere like on the wiki
it's the perfect pink nu quote
now that that's over with, can i wipe my rank and start over?
ebony warrior
go back to level one, you noob
i vote option a.
oh god, he's lost it
was there 8 of them? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i died for the xth time. good thing i have plenty of max revives that can’t be destroyed or taken away from me
(though i'll admit i hated the art style, for some reason)
remember kids, always make the best use of your situation
and we're done
point to a direction
it's mostly cats playing musical instruments
same, how do you think i got lvl 90 lul
you mean the kajiit?
oh yeah another great thing about the db
shadowmere
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
random thought: ok, so for lunch, i had a chicken parmesan sandwich at one restaurant. normally, it has tomato sauce on it, but for some reason, they put some sort of meat sauce on it
i had to take it off because it felt like i was eating a sloppy joe
it was so bizzare
what does? me not getting sleep or you helping me?
but does a tough battle make a good character?
please dont blow up dan
my soul is an eye
that works too i suppose
oooh sounds tasty
like...its either liking an early gen or hating all early gens for not being new enough
hey thats what i heard
my word against yours
and current events are a grey area
and before anyone else does it...
wrong answer
this is not one of those times
i mean i never talk there either, but it seems like a friendly community
wait what the fuck theres a bards college in skyrim
it's in the game
plus daedric hand
every single hold and solstheim
feelsfrogman
these are dark magic bombs
darth pelagius the mad
remember, im pushing for the skyrim/prequel meme crossovers
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
while im trying to also work on another monitor
playing with my brothers
nice
nice giratina icon
oh right his 10 year starting anniversary was a while ago now too
now i just need to come up with good designs for it
yeah but so was your chlorophyte design :p
master, are we going to have a single house for the npcs or several houses that we build up over time?
*half an hour later*
firered omega (at least the version i have) doesn't back-implement mechanics.
by the way, did you like the skates in x/y?
in black/white, i went back to nimbasa to fight the trains there all the time.
though there is one part where you need 2 pokémon
anime titties
im just saying i like seeing them clearly
all titties are beautiful
this again?
(i'm not really, i just hate the taste)
thiccccc
but i love zebstrika ❤
yeah you definitely know when you got it
you can narrow down the suspects
i think we’re talking about this because i mentioned not feeling well
mr meatball nose
i can feel them
that changes nothing
the fork is a weapon. it deals 1 damage and cant be boosted.
i was about to say and you thought diver was good
so we can replace chests with other chests?
and no
"if it ain't broke, don't skittying fix it"
yay i got occlusion culling to work
quite obviously
solstheim
he'll bow train even before the mission lol
work is never fun
rip scalebound
correction: if had some entertaining features in the netcode
ehh, i'm no bitch unlike apparently the rest of the internet, i love the snow
and all of a sudden, i feel tired...
i still have to work until 7:15
activate work sleep
i just got back from work
i know the feeling ida
thanks xenoblade
that's what i thought
that's very generous
can confirm
good, it's working
oh then that's your fault
oh dear
welp guess ill go kill alduin for the first time
i am the department of health
im waiting for the good part which im assured is coming
what story
dawnguard best questline
fetch quests are boring to me
mash left click: the game
im playing it because ive been assured by numerous people that "i would like it"
the ocean one?
that's why i enjoy botw so much even though a lot of people criticize the game for that
like what?
i never play competitive games though, i've always been a solo player
i’m back from work ya ninnies
and i don’t know why, but my phone battery was going down really fast today. it was at 3% when i got home. it never gets down that low
after a while phone batteries just shit themselves for some reason
unless his discord username is different now.
what
im confused now
shoving off to sleep, was nice knowing you, etc, dont burn the place down, etc, etc, etc
too bad this is fireproofprooffire
if i have kept all the attempted footage then i might've considered making a blooper reel at the end of the video for the heck of it lol xd
help im bored
i get what they were trying to do, but i just don’t like their characters
step 1: open the computer
the fang moves weren't until gen iv anyway.
the fact you needed 2 ds units was a big kick in the teeth as well.
i've actually started using items less since i've gotten better at the game.
"the champion uses a level 2 voltorb".
100% oj, 2d game.
pokémon crystal, 2d <:keepo:327304799919800321>
reminds me a little of world of final fantasy with the chibi-like characters.
keep in mind that maplestory screenshot was back in 2008 or so.
he actually went with sprites for the game "because it was faster".
rest well.
and it's causing hadvar to skip around helgen
argonian?
and now im gonna feel like an asshole when it turns out he had a perfectly valid reason not to come in
hi home, im dragonite
bikeblade: xenoride
ughh, i have to do bleak falls barrow to do the civil war?
fucking bullshit
yes but why
no you just have to do bleak falls barrow
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
what are you playing? emerald?
it was only 2 feet deep
thats how high up we are
you got it
t=+10 minutes and the teacher is talking about scifi military strategy with a student
also i think tolfdir just needs an alembic in every room because this is the 3rd time im finding it for him
because that sounds violent
my dog is bad at pooping
<:lul:305559915714576385>
you ate some thing edible
i feel like my eyes have been opened
they suck
tell the physics gnomes to stop fucking around
could you imagine doing a group playthrough on medium core?
yea.
or hardcore if you're yrimir or leviathan.
i hate cars, i'd much rather follow aranea's career path
doesn't hurt that dragoon has like always been my favourite ff class
*shrug* the instructions said not to
seems i must have my 50 million tabs of terraria wiki open again
there's a thing called raids going on blade and soul
just go resub
<a:peepocheer:422063843938926602>
no, that is incorrect
avicii was just found dead
pretty big guy iirc
never got into him myself but yeah
this dude
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
but yes
and try to put iron your bread without asking 2-4x
butter luck next time

i just did
is it bad that i can only assume that's m.website programming?
i don't think you can get a dump of ios.
it deletes a quarter of its messages when  there are more than 8k messages
and to answer draco's question, i didnt feel like having it pm me or routing it to a channel in the log server
i know
saw this stephen face in his discord, had to show it 😛
yeah that was me except imperial the first time around
someone enlighten me on how that qualifies as a "meme"
this is healthy
defuq does that mean
is there a problem with 5 minute intros? because ive been working on one i think is pretty nice.
it's because satire's not actually at all different from what it's mocking
i love the eric andre meme because i loved that scene anyways, and i always read the caption in his voice
sounds good
guts cancels it out.
true.
frost giant.
the amazon?
well i found my 5 weapons to go for in pre-hardmode.
i had a few gold.
wellp raid time
it's similar to fargo's but it allows you to summon minibosses and rare enemies like the lost girl.
i dont see why not
alrighty.
except cenx's set
i'm gonna build my karma by being super nice and giving people stuff so that i can eventually guilt anyone who get's cenx's armor to give it to me
okay, just wanted to make sure it's fair game even though it's in another world
ehh, i'll just grab everything useful and we can sort out rules on friday
ahh, i get that from eyan
just dont go straight to 400 h- wait youre already at 320 arent you?
why wouldn't i?
reaver shark
you idiot
until next time, gentlemen.
not in that order
hmmm
best comment ever
but i don’t want to be 9 again. i don’t like school 😛
which had explosives in it
good luck with that
thank
with your chickens in 3 of them
hint: the middle three always evaluate to "true"
list all the methods of lcass corpus
well obviously they didn't know what they were doing anyway
fucking lol, i just got a money trough
okay anyway im sleep now
save the flubsing the place down for flubs
good job
oh those are nice
thank you kind sir
lol, got a clam cane farming for sea stars
well i like luigi for reasons other than dabbing
play some portal two. theres a part in there where he kills you.
who downvoted that
good job
premiere prides itself on being slow tbh
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
but actually the best way to edit movies is to write individual java programs for each video to be edited by them
you kidding me? i just screenshot each individual frame, paste them onto powerpoint slides, and program the slide show to go through 30 slides each second
okay in all honesty powerpoint's animation options are honestly really good in some cases
moviemaker[][]
it used to
i think they killed it along with annotations tho
when i started, i didn't know how to screen record
movie maker is nice
right squid?
speaking of video editing, i should edit video
but i don't feel like editing video
dammit
i like potatoes. do you like potatoes?
no you just havent caught up with death yet
just the one.
although i broke that trend.
do i get another trophy for level 60?
you fit right in here. =w=
won't have to do those things for another year
touhou 8 is the one game i managed to clear.
calc is great because it combines that numbers sense of math with physics applcation
not a full clear though.
jsut started derivatives and theyre fun
ooh lolol
there's a bit of a bug with marisa and alice.
that*
we didnt do much abs in precalc
deriving matrices ??
oh nice
whats ab again?
also im so excited to learn about infinite series
and by recently i mean a few months ago
oh wow really? i heard some can solve equations on their own and stuff
well damn, there you go
oh wow
lol it's really not that bad, simplifying is probably the hardest part and still thats pretty easy
for example on the ti-30s if you type in -1^4 you get -1
so you have to type in (-1)^4
one thing: don't ever graph an integral or a derivative on a ti-84 or ti-83. it could take like 15 minutes to draw the freaking graph
differential equations can be hard though
why are we talking about trees now
i would imagine so lol
or say why the formula doesn't always work
the formula was n² + n - 1
but when n = 14 you get 77 which is composite ;/
hang on
if you were told simply to disprove a formula's ability to only generate primes then why do you need to make a new formula with the same objective?
yea i havent even touched a single course on physics
it's confirmed, there is a 2nd spaghetti
my alarm isnt a screeching voice and i still hate it
that is new
well you shouldn't "ignore" feedback on a video
then you should try engaging more with your viewers in the video, giving a question of the day (kinda like what eyan's done in the past)
i don't bother leaving comments cause i'm afraid people will come after me
i have that same mindset demonlord
assholes need lessons taught to them
so clearly he knew he screwed up
yea, fun fact i never named my chanel after him, i was trying to be original but still naming myself after something related to space
he made me face palm so hard
he was trying to say how much of a hypocrite i was being, when literally i was doing nothing hypocritical in any regards. granted i could've articulated my response much better, but still
the nightmare was hard demon at one point
or given my personal rating
yeah that one's super hard
i started acropolis when it was #45
hotball1 is, to date, the only person who's ever beaten bloodbath on 60hz
hotball is undoubtedly the best in the world right now
though i think my days in the game are numbered, since i dont want to get a 144hz monitor for just one game and one game only, and i dont even think my laptop can run that type of monitor
<:lul:305559915714576385>
how would you plug that in?
looks like java doesn't care master lul
wait
does that make sense?
what do you need for javac to work?
half of my class dropped out thinking it was too hard in bluej
now we just mash ctrl+k once we dont have any error messages
if its java just bother me with it
and by that i mean ill do the throwing shit at it for you
i'll give you the right answers but it'll be in a really obtuse and not-useful way of doing things
also how long has java been running on exactly 3 billion devices?
have fun master
speaking of things going horribly wrong, im glad i bought a new mouse today since the one i have now is starting to work worse as time goes on
for some reason i thought you were deino mite, kugal
scishow did a video on them a while ago
youre lewd
i hate rugs
nah they just suck in general
like 2.3 sneak peek?
apparently cosmic cyclone was cancelled
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
agreed
gonna assume jdk 10
i forget the jdk version
alright, cya have fun
they were poisoned
because the projectile starts on the other side of them
now if youll excuse me, i have the exact same video to watch on repeat for the next half hour
<:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>
!rank
you know
i've been watching some of chugga's lp and it looks pretty fun to me
lets get some bagels my friends
the bagel song
i don't know what you're talking about
with a very big appetite
sure
wtf is max()
exactly what it sounds like
well it is double spaced so that works
fuck
i can prove its dark magic and have you burned at the stake
i just wanna be around it
yeah you're michael faraday or something
crap
except the mets lost
<:doit:334014889137930240>

man i wish i could play xenoblade now
85 is perfect

1. something happened and i got booted out of character creation before i was done.
2. i'm being called away to mow the lawn so....
me too
i could get work done
i said i'd provide a handwriting sample for someone
why not just feed them to a dog
can i just put dog as background and then take picture of computer background and then email the background to a test ipad at apple and then email off of that to a bank so they can print it on the back of checks?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
problem solved
but hes made of alcohol
youve ruined it
oh wait no thats just the weather balloon thats on fire. the sky isnt on fire
oh wait
ateveryone who here's life isnt a dumpster fire?

gummy you forgot the part where flubs and i set fire to things
and i have the one thats just a shell with kenobi's face on it
that'll be refreshing
well be plain
i mean we've known about it for almost a year so i would hope there's something

arent sata cables generally easy to get a hold of though?
yeah im still typing
we have it in precalc
that doesnt make sense
*kinda*?
also the limit of what
that doesnt make you any more sane
simple as in, you can do it on any calc
no please my brother help
oh no you dont
yeah close enough on the zeroes
i'm more used to people referring to it as 2π, in math
mu is a pokemon
why are you giving a math lesson to flubs? and flubs, it’s “mew”
i blame the english majors for making a shitty api
when was i supposed to learn this shit
thats like the last science i paid attention during
but its fun to learn
ok more chemistry stuff thats easy
maybe. that was 7th grade so i *might* not remember it
can’t we just talk about video games or something entertaining?
mercy killing please
fun conversation. now to figure out why rotating the camera turns the world upside down.
it’s night; closer to a midnight snack than brunch
as opposed to the double-precision one

you gotta do so much to make them not gross
good night. be back in 3 minutes.
im back.
pretty sure most of us will have those mobs regularly attacking us, plus we can just grind a few golems into dust along the way
it'll mostly be the mermen that are the issue

anyway brb off to physics class for a lovely lovely test
it's great
yes, but then the trash will return and still need to be taken out

what were the questions?
im bored and class has yet to start. someone do something.
not that
or is that our supply of kiwalas
my class might be the first in our school in history to have someone suspended before graduation
do teachers know
he was saving it for a party tonight
ya know some people just overeat like normal people
i don’t he will even get suspended
wow sounds like that guy
you should be happy
flubs
it shows what a great class we are
but you know just take the compliment and move on
i can confirm, boyfriend punching is a great pastime.
i have no opinion i am romantically involved with a weakling
i’m back from work ya ninnies
correct.
one less treasonous person to deal with
yeah either way it's messed up
didn't think i'd get this far
it seems we are at an impasse
well you don't perpetually speak musketreason, not here at least so that has to be at least partially wrong
if you arent sure what to do try sleeping on it. tackle the situation with a level head tomorrow
flubs get to fibusing
i just hope that the first time i meet any of you irl that my first words are "listen here, you little shit."
good morning

and when they expect you to be in front of people
or something like that
eaten*
for once you didn’t collapse something
mmmh
also bagels are made with hot water apparently
well yeah
it’s fun
flubs had influenced on it
he knew it was going to collapse
but that has the side effect of showing that you hang out with assholes
and only assholes do that
hmmm honestly i been a big dick this whole time...
i’m back from work ya ninnies
how so?
if i qualify then i'll be able to take pre-calculus ii and introductory physics in college this fall <:feelsgoodman:327315048252833793>
btw thats what the college catalog says^
hahaha
gummy what the fuck
i think that was just a general statement
~~or is it?~~

unsigned bytes, rather
primitive types dont have methods
now the teacher walked in and he's talking about civ or something with one of the classmates
what happens if i unwrap?
so you do want to knowm
a programmer's wife tells him to go to the supermarket to get a gallon of milk and if they have eggs to get a dozen. he comes home with twelve gallons of milk.
and he’s using empire total war to help him learn...
i've been a pretty diehard fan of far cry for a while
the gameplay ive seen on reddit kinda reminded me of just cause
so you can still wingsuit in and land on a guy to kill him, but you can also take the dead guy's knife and throw it into the skull of the guy who was chatting with him
except reddit blessed things like keanu and donald glover and uhh, overwatch? do they still love overwatch?
because only high quality shitposts make it through
but rdr2 is on the horizon so they're gonna swap ~~cash cows~~ games
thats true, maybe we'll get a gtavi within ten years then
i didnt like that one
thats asshole though right
this was a repeat of what happened two years ago
also i *finally* got a fucking hug outta you
shhhh
i kinda wanna frame it
i only have ever hugged you and ida in this server
it's misty freaking out
nah rainy they were being crazy amount of bitch
what do you think?
niht
fuck
it's 1:30 in the morning and i'm documenting my code
i'm not your guy, buddy
yeah lets go with that
did someone say math lesson? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
no, square the temperature
that sentence doesnt make sense to me
glad to hear you're better, wolve.
i think its like wolv-ee
ive never thought about it
wolv-eh like as if you just cut off wolverale
then you are safe
as long as eyan doesn't have startup issues
because if we update there's a damn good chance that something will break for nightshade
same
backward is not an option
reverse reverse

yeah fuck life
please remember to keep content appropriate

totally didn't forget the conditional statement ? in there
alright
it's quite obviously flubs going in to ensure gummy trying to reunify everyone for the 4th era doesn't go south
if you get the "good" ending
what should you do if you accidentally got a magnet stuck inside your pc case
uhuh
and remember the left hand rule
and i thought i worked out a lot lol
terrible rotator cuffs
yeah im not dead yet
and when's that?
something about technicians
you use these words
but i dont understand
go faster than camera take picture
every flashlight flashes
electron shoots out light, how often electrons take turns taking shoots is the flash speed
the flash
yeah, i think that’s important
see but next year we’re ditching and playing d&d
what do i need for that?
and a keyboard
what here needs modifying?
wait
* what went wrong:
could not determine java version from '10.0.1'.
you dont have it still?
ive already seen the light
java vs java ee?
wait what
did some cable management and how at 100 mbps
slow clap
sure csi shows misuse it but its not the word's fault
it could also be "enunciate" but that's only a thing i have problems with
i didn't pay attention to what you said
wanna make games with me and master?
lol bob the builder
tell the friend to make games too
also gummy im sorry to hear that
anyway if i can wrap my noggin around github ill let you poke through and make fun of what im working on
i woke up at 6:30 for an ap exam
welp
im a doof
now the "run" button is just not doing anything
real java meaning notepad++ and cmd/
i cant remember how it works now though
if you go the long way instead of just using the formula theres like 80 points of fuckupability
also i hope they give me my score immediately because there's only 6 spots left in the class i want; there were 10 at the beginning of the week
oh gorsh
3+4=5
i think 5-24-25 is also one
it's not
so tomorrow can be like a testing day for me
i like casios but the rest of the planet likes the texas instrument

why?
and then just a fucking big ass square of farmland
i'm on second summer rn i think and have a whole herd of the fuckers
but that costs 150000
you have to finish all the vault bundles in the community center.
im just not gonna show up
that seems like a bad strategy
yeah it is but im a messed right now
yeah but 500 people will be watching...
hey bella
im not going to trip
<:keepo:327304799919800321>
youve been thinking to much, time to start doing
yeah we know
proudspire manor is a nice house...
so far operation: one small thing is falling apart probably because it was a dumb idea
i know
sometimes relationships just take time to heal, other times it may be for the best that they never do
idk who to pick though
no fighting
it was thanks to war that got me in this mess
and year 2 fall
you're almost done the game if i'm not mistakne.
as the game has no ending
its really all in the last house upgrade that unlocks the cellar
the only gold level tool you really need is the pick.
watering can upgrades are the surprisingly nice ones tho
theres those junimo huts you can get
and try to get the kegs, theyre worth even more
like doubling numbers
but i guess i should be "stupid" about these things as my parents say
nah, we're just gonna go get me an id at the dmv monday and im gonna go take the test tuesday
its honestly luck of the draw
damn
it's not like the class is experimental
sorry im human, fuckin hell
theyre worth nothing on their own but so much when put into a fucking barrel
and hops are pale ale so youre wrong too rainy
ill give you a hint, they wont be in a barrel
why are you upvoting
why riot
why cant i have a super secure password
and those varieties being longer means theres more to put in there
riot hates pass phrases confirmed.
yeah but if a bunch of passwords leak from a site or something and you use the same one for everything, it doesnt matter how secure it is
why do you think i have a place to copy and paste them all in from?
stahp
so no upset for you
of all the things to make me not upset...
it was funny to watch though
my social interaction is with idiot customers at work
and ok coworkers
yaya
ah shit
spoilers: everyone *except* jesus dies
it's only once a year that you get to have a go with those hats
since we have graduation first because they don’t want kids to worry about finals and grad at the same time
~~phanpy.~~
i am so happy right now
oh nvm he's playing empire lol
yes you are
in a bed
and the bed
only one way to find out
because that thing is longer than my entire body and thicker than my forearm
i can and will suck a duck

it was only 20%?
wait that was 20%?
either that or you put one of your "or"s in the wrong place

hes getting further and further away
also master yoru coding style is abysmal
you say that like i know what style is
i threw him through a window.
2,000 feet minimum.
it's 6 and 2/3rds football fields tall.
at a grad party
gummy uninstall
sorry drag am watching arrow season 1
borderline drunk
know what would be nice?
if java had an access type that was read-only
sorry to hear that
guys i screwed up my code
everything
windows 3.1
i copied and pasted from the semi-working version on github
nah that cant be it
<:lul:305559915714576385>
my code still isn't working
actually code that
we're gonna need to insert some metal kidneys
so tonight i finally get to relax with empire
it's "only" flirting with 3 here
that was exciting
electric cars are the future
yeah i know
wait until battery technology improves ida
way less pollution
i hope youre charging them rent
they like the fossil fuel stuff
man i love empire total war
i can truly live in the 18th century now
also met a new friend at the party
it was not drinking btw
covalently or ionically?
we talked about the art of history
can you name a single murder that history wasn't involved in?
if i murder you tomorrow that'll be the future instead
but i never said i hated them
i want some more twisted ice tea
gummy alcoholic confirmed
well i’m going to let my friend text soon
@gummy's friend: run
@gummy's friend: chuck his phone in the lake
she is the only friend i made cry
\:nothinking\"
$1.26 a liter
gummy said ‘go screw yourself’ then smiled a little
perfect
ask him when and where
and gummy's friend seems a little bit degrading, is there anything else that you'd rather have us call you?
holy fuck imma go buy a cake
there you go
get one for everyone here too
obviously
i forgot my wallet and came home
what the skitty it's full of dog treats
oh thats benny's
he said ‘thanks i really appreciate that’
also hes a lightweight
gummy says ‘get out of my face i feel really insulted’
the grad date was yesterday though
<:gwupugurithinking:390299785841606656>
lord gummy is back
but it's all lemon cake and some weird nut flavors
also gummy don't call your friend those things
she calls me a lot of things as well <:raritywink:278584590300348416>
i paid him
slow clap
did the censor not work?
e!censor-all
i honestly have no clue what is and isnt censored
unless you changed it
does she have a brother?
go for it
smart bois
yall can laugh but i legit had a job in a lab one summer that involved an instrument called a "penetration penetroometer"
is it a tool that penetrates and measures penetration?
ida phrasing
it's treason
is it all private?
oh yeah gummy
people just sub
people
go with 1 to not fall into their r/fellowkids shit
my final english grade is 96% :v
oh i'm in 11a, 10r was nice
especially for the books where your teacher has read them and interpreted them differently than you.
luckily i've never had to choose my own book
i spent more time trying to decide what book to read
i didnt like those computerized tests
you had to drag her to doctors?
blugh people are annoying
what is condom snorting
you cant snort a condom
which is funny
i mean i've tried interfaces first hand and that explanation still doesn't help anything make sense
there's at least two in my colossal cave adventure knockoff that i sent you a few days ago
you need to plug them into the coaxial outlet with the xlr switch enabled
public class potatosalad implements nutrition```
so that way when you pass a potatosalad instance to a metabolish instance it knows it can extract that information
bella's going to yell at us again for talking about code isnt she
i can agree
man, i usually can read java pretty fluently but this libgdx source is a wonder amalgamation of things which i have no idea what they do
what?
check for "this is a prank" on the lottery token
it’s legit

gummy what did you do

well i accidentally invited my favourite mod to my new server
~~or you could just be yourself~~
and suddenly it goes from cloudy to pouring in 5 seconds
she’s super cute
no idea what that is
they axed it in 2014
have fun
ok next is the trumpet blaring from the sky
yeah
e gadd?
you are supposed to be “okay i know your public servers failed, but i know you well so what the motive this time for a friend’s server?”
i left because my brain couldn’t take it here anymore so i needed a fresh start
holy shit
hmm i might want to think about turning off the computer in case the power goes out .-.
time to play singleplayer games and not save
skyrim no save run
that was fun
holy crap its almost six pm and nobodys done anything for dinner bye
yep, weird
howdy do pal
?0.0225"?m  

in other words, i spilled water on my keyboard and cleaned it off with my elbow
it is
night
who wants to guess what i was about to type
wrong, it was "brb food"
also i needed the territory of egypt which was own by the ottoman empire at that time so instead of declaring war and taking it, i did it the ida way
i cant think of a time frame where thats a good idea
actually he has one for every day of the year
ive decided to work on climbing rope and high jumps this year
that does not look like a kaiser
barf green with chunks.
no doubt
how many lurkers are there here?
its up to 40
these days
good luck with that
i guess you aren’t hungry
anyway can you guys actually go vote
obviously
so you say
the following year students were not permitted to change the wallpaper
i like to take credit for that
i think i’m starting to feel drunk. what alcohol was in those?
bricks are soft. i thought he meant at least quartz.
<:rarityreally:427915987082280961>
the exit code
normally zero
none of them are done well, however
fuck it i'll do the english during cs
camelot 2.0 is going well
thanks you broke both my hands
gummy remind benny that im rooting for him
so i have confidence that i'll qualify for the course
well, i just recorded another video. now, i really need to get back to working on the script for one video that i haven’t worked on for a while now
<:lul:305559915714576385>
congratualations, kugel.
who is this squi? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
and then you decided to edit and ruin it
nice
in javascript and game maker anyway
in java decidedly not
well i can't change it on mobile sooo x d
<:gwcfcthonk:357907199928041473>
well it isn't
ouo!
yeah, i checked myslf after i was off by  like 0.1 or so
mfw i can take math126 and math127 both over the summer 😮
_shakes fist at the skyy
master have you looked at libgdx yet
<:doit:334014889137930240>
night
so happy to get that done
he does still occasionally stream on twitch.
outage
yeah, you didn’t get the joke dragonite
in theory: yes
in practice: there's like a hundred fifty lines we'd have to do that to and neither of us has the patience for that
but seriously how do i archive this dm without a bot?
ok i have 40 minutes of photo transfers left to do
currently counting 435 photos
whenever my (great?)grandparents were high schoolers
1930s?
no probably going to copy paste chant du départ and change some words
~~tacos are too overrated to be in a national anthem~~
that sounds like the villain from splatoon 3
no bella no...
now you can use them for food preparation
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
you made soup?
again?
that won't end well
update: real life sucks. who wants to talk about video games?
you people arent very good at this
(－‸ლ)
i keep seeing people spawning in with an obviously cheated in amount of coins
i heard this isnt even the final build
maybe they'll finally add fast travel. the started to in the industrial update but its gotta improve
the one about clocks or something
i seen both and the censor version pissed me off
they don't curse in this movie but they changed words up
i have a growing amount of dislike for these types of videos. if you're not into a game yourself that's fantastic, no need to ruin it for other people.
personally, i think everyone has a right to voice their opinions. as long as we respect each other and have calm discussions on them
gomme sounds like a devil fruit
it's a great song though
i am glad i changed a few words
try this
mee6 disapproves.
but yeah sing that song
oh fuck maybe
could be
<#305548986155008000> plz
then build damage, fuck atma's
no bad apple
christ, i'm just not going to, this shit has happened multiple times in league and it's never ended well
fuck i’ll fix it on pc
and awesome holidays
we've kept our hoovsies warm at home
nah but like
interfaces are really nice when you need to inherit from multiple things
back to work
i just have the server frozen
all the males with legs
also i have no idea what an incel is and i dont know if i want to put it in my search history, what is it?
its a wonderful group to laugh at because you know they'll be sad and alone forever
im perfectly happy on my own
and also it makes me a better singer
it's 19 in canada
rainy what is your drinking age
i guess that makes sense
so i think the year my mom hit 18 they upped it
and i'll agree hex maniac is top tier, but we can never have enough big titty goth gfs
that seems fair to me
you heard the man gummy
your youth or your life as payment
no rainy
i should sleep
got the female combee already for vespiquen
sneak 100
but now i'm a higher enough rank than her that we can no longer play competitive together
rip lol
wow o.o lol
magical strawberry
~~do you need to get hit with a tranquilizer dart?~~
no squid
not all of them
unless we get like 1000 members, we probably won't have more than 3
squid you can be the guru of the gutter
96% on my geometry final :v
i made a rounding error, which is weird because how i've been rounding is the same way i'[ve been rounding the entire year and it's never done me bad until now
not from family but from my community
greetings, will.
lol true
seems about right
oh, wait i forgot that was a good yoyo, i think i might've tossed one -.-
i switch between new saves and my main all in one
sounds like me trying to teach mom to play portal
(yes my new emote worked)
or are we legit just waiting for eyan
and i only accidentally summoned wof twice
but let's be really nice about it so when he wakes up he doesn't feel any negative emotion about it
hello
so, is eyan dead or still asleep? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
pretty much same thing
i am a gf of one, sadly
dont worry bb we can be great friends too
<:ouo:324282210821865474>
*noms cooking* <:roofat:399827527864025088>
<:fat_think:330657519309422592>
hi bella <:rooduck:399827506665881600>
he's also playing terraria.
im like
<:roodab:428512363340365834>
youre probably the only one who has
<:sneakylul:337886705468047360>
unlucky
or flubs
also, lol rc
one was fine, the other was boring
not many people are that dedicated to school xd
i remember one time we played guitar hero in math class
it was a very simple math class lol
stick figures fte
guys i have a major issue...
since when do i want to read?
i was just about to ask them
i will smite thee
fool.
i think i need to leave the server for a bit guys
praise me.
okie dokes sleep well! <:roonap:399827505940398090>
have fun stay safe
that was my family friendly version of dont do drugs and wear protection
anyway sleep now bye
flubs im getting too old
me getting old made me lose my throne
you missed the dumpster
drago can i borrow $30?
they are great
youre great
i can’t handle compliments from you
yeah because you had a death
```js
        });```
i saw the food master was having and now im even more excited to have ribeyes in a few hours
at least until the sun comes out again
is there still a potential stream today?
don’t be angry
but ugh
the l word
next week's stream is scheduled for saturday instead of the usual friday.
not here
question how a bot went to school
wait
and just laughing my ass off
that’s amazing
i wonder if i can set my discord game to "discord"
you very much can, drago
is a pint of ice cream a lot?
10/10 would make that mistake again
the banished
and apparently not giving up
aurelion sol?
the dude who has a bone and the dude that is actually just his soul
sets their bones on fire
look, there’s only one set of bones
activate self destruct protocol
rii vah
well that could be problematic
(◕ ε ◕)
i only explored like 30% of guar plains
god now i wanna see a twenty video long series of drago dying in a game. no context, no explanation, just you dying over and over and over
ive only edited like fifteen or sixteen btw
1080p60 will do that to you
tbh 1080p60 is probably way overkill for a wii game but i cant be bothered to figure out how to change the recording settings so im sticking with it
i use 1080p60 for mine too but use shadowplay. stuffs a lot smaller
that's probably because shadowplay doesn't record at like a terabit per second
thats no fun
what does bitrate even change
how many bits per second the thing uses to encode video
anything higher than 50 will probably be overkill
hey i am still salty a revolution happen and i got de throne
your spleen hole is bleeding so much you must know something
she got me some fish bowl
idk what it is but it smells nice
oh like taco style of bowl?
then yeah idk it
lasagna

oh yeah that
the hell
stabbing someone isn’t nice <:fluttershyscared:447198814747492352>
how far are you intro trig? like just starting out?
my worst joke:

<:lul:305559915714576385>

what have you done to deserve a promotion?
does this mean i can finally shoot someone with a musket?
flubs you gotta hear this
oh yeah
i dont know what any of that means
look
no you just make the calls to anyone who's not there's parents
operators being?
i dont do terms
now watch me mod this nail gun to shoot targets across the room
i think its the gay straight alliance. at least my school had one of those
sure put me in charge of the younger gays
but gummy is right there should be a sports team that is just...comically bad at *everything*
fuck ive been caught
its called today we were bored and made this
hes the leader of the cheerleading team
not if you have really strong arms
what are you gonna do
wait technically shouldn’t i be a film teacher as well?
i wish i took cad in high school
probably the week after
blanket buddies extracurricular
i didn’t even finish my 7th grade sewing assignment
well now he’s pure alcohol
kangaroos in science class would be awesome
watch him at the casinos
no eyan is the school mascot
he can be like "here's how you dont do it"
yeah dragonite birthed you, skarm
does the school of zeal have a dark brotherhood chapter?
fuck you im the assassin
just in case
ヽ(°▽ °)ノ
but there better be food there

computer science, except all your variables have to be dovahzul words
we're gonna include noncanon
wait im fucking retarded
e!google dovahzul translator
i was thinking that
do e!skarm
but the fact that it exists is pretty cool
you are joining my army
im doing physics homework
something something cosine fifteen
<:lul:305559915714576385>
wrong text field
what flavor of ice cream was it?
who's our pro ice cream rater?
custard is superior
just shot everyone
thinkingface
good enough
r/tumblr is my shit
"to prevent shitposting, we must prevent any and all non-100%-poker-face discussion about exactly what we believe in"
do people even use that term anymore
i am france though
he's doing his job all week to have time for a date with his gf that's long distance, he'll be streaming around 8 pm est on saturday probably
watch ponies
darn
understand
considering there are 52! different combinations...
isn't it technically rereleased? cuz atma's was in season 3, i remember the warmog's atma's darius days
dude atma's + shoujin spear or whatever it is
darius, garen
i think are highest
alright gn
i got high hopes
good news i have a way with words
i have with some people
self proclaimed title but made me aggressive and very bossy
have at it
that's what google said
idk how to do that in discord though
i don't see anything wrong with the math though
i should probably do the same, night all
well, i think i got a cold or sinus infection or something. yesterday, i couldn’t stop coughing and today, my nose won’t stop running
on the subject of this school thing, i have made the executive decision as head of the gsa: gsa stands for gay shit ayylmao now
rainy with the creative names
you wanna be part of gay shit ayylmao?
nah, only requirement is that you laugh at a gay meme at some point
except that one that rainy posted
oh boy i have to be proctored for a final in an hour and 20 minutes
never saw that show but heard good things about it, lol
whatever floats your goat
it’s alternate history
okay im a general
that wasnt even a pun
it makes me pass my classes
uh ok
new informatiin
guys code red
but im trying something new...
how about diamond and pearl..,
all my sun and moon settings are messed up
diamond seems like the fan favourite though
its when youre social or something
then no further questions
but i could
do it
either way works lol
or something of the sort
that's pretty <:roopog:442070287769403402>
probably closer to like 7-8 months, but yeah.
i missed the old me
i was so aggressive and happy
not as much
oh, that's the bitch i get to stab, irght?
at the very least i was lurking in here when you were talking about it <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
youre even in stealth mode rn
hiding from someone?
i'm always hiding from someone <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
nice
i hate algebra <:rooderp:399827526744014848>
omegle?
that's a neat site
wait
can you ask her to let me finish my finals first
thanks
be proud of your sneak skill
how the fuck did i read kfc as rc
why the fuck does nobody include the vocative case in their data
because it bothers you
at least that's why i don't
get sarah to beat him then
yeah
but if im being completely honest this science course was very good
is benny still drunk?
and everyone
applies to any of these since i enjoy autumn
used to hate autumn but now i love it
yes rainy?
or drink yourself super sick and use that miserable morning as fuel to be sparing
i just like autumn because i get to wear all of my favourite clothing <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
fruit rum okay
i can get behind this last statement
also hot coffee on a winter morning is the only reason i'm not 100% atheist
were you just gonna uber everywhere? <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
gas is expensive btw
why not
you get the idea
why not
so we start at around 12040 bc ish?
but im playing games and stuff right now
and my allergies got really bad
thank you!
responses vary wildly and are very entertaining
my favourite being the 22 death enemy sona saying "np"
guys
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>
yeah thats how it works
no it just hurts
we just need a place to host and some sort of teleportation device
only a list of two things to obtain to make this pizza party a reality
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
he did like a couple weeks ago but not since then
actually that's not true
i still can take the inverse of functions and boring stuff like that
man i love war
im taking two english classes this summer so yes i am quite dead indeed
sounds lame
if you know what that means
sleeping early was 3 hours ago
18 incidents, 3 systems
i sleep
flubs flubs
how was it a good idea?
i mean you *love him*
what'd you do this time
<:gwcfcthonk:357907199928041473>
good times
i don’t wanna study anything
only if it's our favourites <:rooez:399827519286542336>
im just staring at emotes on my server
i made it myself
man i love mods
im kinda glad that i'll be starting class next tuesday because going a couple weeks without a math lesson i dont really feel right
listen to war music
feel free to tutor me in math <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
<:gwnanamilaceshrug:403295147892277249>
well a lot of stuff happened a while back which caused me to have to retake a bunch of classes
but rum
...yeah started drinking at grad party and now all i can think about it trying everything that’s alcoholic
gummy stop making me stay up
i technically have to be somewhere at 10:30 tomorrow but i got like nineteen hours of sleep today so i should be good right
feels like i never talk to you guys anymore
i’ll go invite him to my friends server
mainly because the people there are called poles
i miss my younger self...looking back whilei did act like an idiot i had ambition and was always happy and aggressive
that's odd there's a ping for tiberia in the oceanpalace channel
i know how to by passed the system
so idc
invade russia in the winter
i don’t wanna be napoléon anymore tbh i only wanna be him when i play my war games
panda you miss some amazing things i just said because idk why i said them
well that explains why everyone got all happy when i told them i gave up my title
now i kick my pants off discord
over 3200 pages
man, i had some crazy pizza dreams last night, tripped the heck out
uh-huh
come on <:raritysmile:447196778517757978>
oh, you thought i meant here?
how do you not eat bacon
back to war
oh i found it
from my point of view what about the wookies?
i mean let's be real, xc1's menus are awesome considering the stupid amount of things that they do
im a sylveon
dammit, i wanted that
oh there once was a hero named ragnr the red
no you dont lose your skyrim license, just your bard college position
how about a septim? wait, make that two septims, i feel like living it up
if you find out let me know too i was wondering that
i still want to do a graybeard run some day
i have no idea how they got that
i pretty much just guess since 3/4 were correct
so i was actually going to do something productive but napoleon total war is calling me
but napoleon total war
gonna start an invasion of the austrian empire
i just took the final, my grade isn't 89% it's actually 94% so soon i'll be the only one with a grade in the 90s lol
i took one class on it at uni
that makes me an expert
history is better
i liked barbas more than clavicus, even if his ai is rock dumb
rueful axe
sadly i wouldn't know very much about that, lol
also i still haven't killed my first dragon and i'm level 30something
one of my geometry teachers never really made jokes often but this one joke i still remember and recite like everyday
i did all of them, i'm pretty sure
the special thing is things outside the house, not sections of the house?
i used to hit my head against things a lot
also a shrine
ask ida on that one
“do you know the definition of insanity?” vaas
since i was considered dangerous and capable of defending myself
i hate everyone myself but i have a reason
i just hate stupidity, in both myself and others
i dont really hate stupidity, i hate ignorance. because ignorance can make you look really stupid
strengthen the empire, weaken the thalmor
the stormcloaks wouldn't be able to face them
i'm funny like that
who said anything about needing to dance to like edm
i also don’t get why drake is pretty much the most popular “musician” right now in all genres
modern rap is like saying classical music
and the nm pays good money
what category is pony music in?
and it gives you a source of dispensable npcs
definitely a country load
who chooses that side
also anthems and game music
i did in my redguard run
speaking of which i need to go listen to god save emperor francis again brb
then why side with him if you're gonna betray him anyways?
how about chant du départ
that was a good song/anthem
i haven't gotten my smithing that high yet
and just took the forsworn with it
they cause me to be stressed the fuck out
they make such satisfying noises when they die
i see falmer, i think chaurus, and become scared
huh i wonder if i _could_ replace the chaurus models with chickens now . . .
that's hakon you fool
it's just my phobias make the game hell for me
awoo
welp a 15 minute talk about math with my dad turned into an hour and a half debate about god
that doesn’t **add** up <:kappa:374346980136058893>
bad news, they want to kill me now
oh hey gummy, hows the windchime?
i say nay
good
don’t you mean wahter? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
nope
yes they're correct in every way
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
a tnt a day keeps the doctor away
and to answer that question majestic i like both
huh, i always found dc to be less interesting because of the characters and their powers make them a bit less interesting, i don't know,
i just don’t care about action movies. except maybe deadpool
hey that’s ben’s money
when you encounter trainings whilst surfing, obviously
remember when i pirate stuff
fuck
hey russia or great britain?
either way ive pretty much stopped paying attention
probably less so after steel got nerfed
nintendo still considers the switch a "handheld"
i t-posed on people a lot today
oh hey i got my id, thanks dmv
my casio displayed them in a way i didnt like so i updated the os so now it does what i want lol
or hit shift then = hat works sometimes
guys
the krabby patty secret formula
fire emblem hates you o3o
i knew something was up
and stuff
let me look
you mean this?
so i may have just invited a pedo to my server 🤦
so i found out he just got ban from that server
i took some steam screenshots, how can i find them?
```that item does not exist. it may have been removed by the author.```
yeah, i set them to private by mistake
"wingardium leviosa"
i’m actually eating right now
i’ll send you this for free
wow gummy
“snowing” his phone? there’s snow on it? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
like the 14.5th?
that makes no sense
sticking little easter eggs all over the audio tracks
its funny when the normal ones do tho
go home
met a french friend yesterday
he’s going to help me learn french
i mean if it took them over an hour
you just need to make a 4-6 min video on why ben franklin should be in the hall of fame
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
dreams do come true
n(n+1)/2
that was fun
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i got a b in bio in 10th grade

what's the idea
but still, i only really enjoyed one class
but, i really enjoyed it
we are not enabling the bot to post memes
rc let me introduce you to this thing called a "microsd chip"
i dont own a car
tell them to turn it off and turn it on again
it was an automated message <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
someone called me earlier. i didn’t answer, but he left a voicemail saying he wants his money back and then bye
same
i should call gummy to get him over here
great, now i'm remembering jffe and i'm thinking we need to have a zeal hall of fame for greatest memers
except i think some people might get pretty pissed off at being inducted
he had his friend reply to me
can you give your friend the line?
you called me in the middle of work...
if benny is illiterate how could he play the slots?
got it
homec
or next time i speak french
indian/russian whatever the fuck it was
your prank call was better than thelastsane prank call
just let me verify
you do know thelastsane right?
know him? i remember killing him
whats his username now?
sane was the annoying one right
but im not sure as of now im still looking it over
assuming that group gets picked on the first 30 rolls
i did this
yea im not too good at stats, i wish i had paid more attention and wrote better notes
sure it does
i've only done 2 chapters on statistics so i may not be the best person to ask for help, lol
i dont remember that but it feels like something i'd do
like you'd expect there to be fewer people with six dogs than people with one dog
i'm so happy
i knew how to solve that at one point in my life
thats not even an answer choice, squid, lol
when we were learning that in high school, i was completely lost
silly goose? have you ever met a goose? they will ter your world assunder
screw them
can we talk about something not related to math?
they're the awkward cousin of algorithms
shut uuuuppp
nice job squid
more math
oh hey baseball involves math
i only asked for three but got a lot 😂
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
oh yeah someone from my group dm decided to send a pic of her butt and yes it was covered so it wasn’t inappropriate or anything but i was still stunned
and now they won’t leave alone about it
well they didn’t know about it but they overheard us laughing
okay i found a new game drago could play
nah he hates golf
well go back there
chucks radio at rc
noms tv
i approve of your username
to answer your question, she doesnt like sheep very much
<:lul:305559915714576385>
if you try to do a bunny hop but then keep your feet back instead its like 10x harder to clear
benny is like the second mascot here
lost
and no, the expos never won one
to look on the bright side
early sleep
at this rate. someday you'll have the courage to take over europe
im practicing already rainy
one mistake napoleon made was at the battle of borodino
just woke up
yeah but with my current teacher the coefficient of fun is reduced tenfold
near the end of the year algebra 2 lessons took me on average 2 - 3 hours to fully master and digest
i guess he didn’t like the rock
youtube has done it again...
apparently the subscription tab will no longer be im chronological order
why would i need lock picks?
brother's on the phone with grandma and he's in the process of having the same conversation for the fourth time and it's driving me mad
it's okay youre not supposed to be able to remember elven names anyway
razelan?
i think it starts with a g
also i thought ida's game said "skype" for a moment
is that nyan cat
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
i don’t think it was that bad; the battle
i never liked the guy but that's a shame :/
also dropping subscriptions overall right now would probably be good as well
this is pointless
for a second, i read “yosuke” as “yusuke” and i thought “wait, you could give best p5 character a piggyback ride?!” <:kappa:374346980136058893>
#notmygeneration
head of the institute
friends decides to troll in server
it's okay squid, we've already been over the fact that your taste in video games is incorrect
wasn't there a song called reputation?
wait that is a tswift album
i don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation
what’s pride and predjudice?
don't sully that name by bringing it up here
used that 4 cheese-blend
sometimes i think benny is kinda like him
nice
brb looking for cheese
and hey, i needed bones for my glove, might as well do it in the dungeon
the plane game was nice
speaking of which i kind of want to play smash 3ds now for no reason
how about napoleon total war?
i beat you in that
biology, who needs it
yeah far
with a sawzall and a blowtorch
\`\`\`do this\`\`\`
since everyone has a different role and in the same category
...this time no drago
it is always the time for java jokes
no we don't need them
gummy, i've identified your affliction
you suffer from a condition called not nerdy enough
fortunately the cure is straightforward and easy to digest, you simply need to spend five or more hours on /r/programmerhumor every day for a month and you should be cured in no time
hello kugal
what did i do
though the mod that is like drago over in the another server does
"i could spend nineteen hours a day breeding and training pokémon that i might use once or twice a month"
what?
who remembers the time i changed camelot's server name to something like "gummy's butt" and then gummy disabled mods from changing the name of the server and i was sad
i dont remember that but that thought got a chuckle out of me
but it was something stupid
nvm master
i don't come up with this stuff out of the blue gummy
take a look
you called it
well i tried
the russian empire sucked after tsar alexander i died
it's exactly like smash
because
change your nickname to /nick
that's a surprising thing to hear from you
nothing happens
nothing?
good job skarm
ww1 one page and was just about canada
ever
also was asleep 2.5 hours before you sent that
we all do
~~so it's fresh in your mind~~
just got done golfing. now waiting for lunch.
“skarm is weird lol” nice pin
id enter that except i can't be bothered to open up ultra moon
it ends on may 28
what did you get, dialga or palkia?
dialga
...*gives drago a fish*
am i?
you just put a kitchen in that house
i hate how even the best questlines have an ending and seem to go by so much faster when you replay them
put poison on the bows, archery buff potion, and sneak/invis potions
you kind of deserve it for being a filthy traitor
so they're just essential
do a no armor run
you mean true dragonborn mode?
khaniit only, no items, final destination
septimus singus has something to say about that
so are we
once again the asshole made me super mad
not you
i didnt do anything though?
drago
i have something very nsfw for you gummy
right master
i think i was caught up for a while but then i stopped paying attention and now i'm about three years behind
same but that is a good one
yeah, like that one guy
everyone here
gummy go spin on a spinny chair or something
so drago is doing life is strange
also the rest of yall really need to start posting creative stuff, i dont like being the only one who dumps stuff in here lol
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
i oneshot the jhin and ekko lategame with auto and maybe an e
why not have a paint concert or a lumber concert instead
take him to symphonic evolutions
no rap
im about halfway through melting down cookies, garlic, and bread into my stomach, if theres anything extra stupid going on today please ping
maybe
im seeing ads for barbecue and getting extremely hungry
wearing skirts above the ankles? society is doomed, i tell you! doomed!
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
so i got between one and a half and two hours of sleep last night
that's not addressed in the privacy policy.
it took me a half hour to figure out what you mean by that
i still threw them out the window*
but its 1
tempted to qupte monty python right now but i cant quite remember the line
just need to find my black lipstick and amethyst eye shadow so i can get in the mood
it’s 7:32 and i already feel like going to bed. help
you don't need most of it
that's still 800 items each
i hoik killed a dungeon guardian fairly early on and then we legit killed another as a group lateron.
one of us kited it back and fourth while the rest of us shot at it.
no watching nature
now if he was into suffering he wouldn't of have a battle axe hovering over you right now
probably because javascript lets you do too many stupid things and would encourage bad programming habits early on
something about blue light
thank fuck
dp2 is almost starting soon
good
though i wish i did cape, i hate it when people mistake me for a *shudders* straight
who is responsible for this
it was
something something lord of the flies
well lord of the flies was dumb also
finally something that doesn't make me regret coming to the theater 20 minutes after the start time
oh shit dp is finally starting
it took me a while that you were not, in fact, talking about diamond and pearl
spongebob is better now
simpsons has been going on longer
32 seasons i believe
wait the simpsons is still airing? i thought they killed that years ago
still airing drago
not too bad xd
thanks guys
i never actually watched that show. does it still have fans?
i think rc needs to hang out with gummy more
even if it was illegal i would still post it
i couldnt stand ash back in like season 1, where have you been
eighteen? he should be in his thirties
i still think he was 16 in x and y
you haev weird friends
> dragonite
damn i said cheese
now i want cheese
and once i find my mic i'll get on for what will probably only last until i either a) go meetup with friends to binge a bunch of shows or b) we decide to play the vidya games
what foobar thing?
welcome back demon lord, expect me to crash your party in the next 20 minutes
who was the asshat who called it foobar?
shush panda it's more fun to blame me
context?
indeed
no you turn into the hulk
i am disappointed in his audience but i can't say it surprises me
it's deja vu all over again
did you try turning it off and turning it on again
hello there
hey there
<:roocry:399827523011084298>
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
it's more or less a religion thats one of those stereotypical ones i guess
sometimes i wanna disappear
guys on a serious note
i did a 7 hour stream yesterday of kingdom hearts
gummy, don’t rip you hair out. unless you want to be bald <:kappa:374346980136058893>
no a hat that's a butt
drago you’re a fried chicken
do you really not remember the name?
no i don’t
ah spyglass
protip: don't take the story super seriously
flubs
and now she has gone "crazy"
either she is faking it or yeah
inebriated
did i say it was morning?
so what you're saying is what you're saying doesn't have any meaning
so my choices are be productive and happy, or be social, never both
ida!
/m,e hugs
the liars
now that my gym is open i'm back to 10-5 sleep schedule, which i really just love
fkubs
the vi mains mod squad int squad
so does that mean you hate me
just saw deadpool 2
was pretty good
i will give you the benefit of the doubt, language moves past nouns before one can even conceptualize an idea as something that exists.
i already know this
sooooo
and i just got done with my workout so i have nothing else to do
i call the english language the language of anguish
do you want an example of how dumb it is?
if it's written out you can decipher, at this point with speaking i don't think you could understand if they used spelling or grammar correcty
like how are you reading my spoken sentences
i get codes tonight
don’t get how most people like wild world more than city folk
wait really?
what separates an idea from a thing?
flubs can you give me 10 examples of ideas that aren't a theory
flubs
if you can make a sentence where the subject is not a noun, i will go drive off a cliff and forward the insurance check to you
that makes no sense
lol, day off, if only
i should probably talk here more
add more colors eyan!!
why does it feel like he never streams anymore
because i kind of want to start over again
god damn it how am i still in the lead?
god damn how is this 2 hour track still playing 5 hours later
its monday
and i was asleep until 2pm so its even shorter for me
monday is usually my saturday, but i got an extra shift cause holiday, cause that makes sense
every day?
have fun with that
~~yourself?~~
hopefully you wont have to learn bluej but the only thing you need to know is how to public static void main
why is he reading the back of a happy meal?
i don't either
what?
was today?
memorial day
i just meant like a ceasefire
well then back to yelling at people for pinging other people
flubs you gotta watch this amazing show that i am currently watching
power rangers
your bagels will be stole
by being a power sniper
cause have you ever heard of missile thrusters?
camelot 2.0 is falling apart because i hesitate on decisions
sleep
a time machine
very carefully. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
not for me
~~did you spend all your money drinking?~~
*our* money, comrade
~~i think skyrim is going to be on your phones now~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
so i just decided to make a text adventure rpg and implement sound
"we here at bethesda are updating our privacy policy"
does dragonite not like bluej
nope shes just sleeping next to the window
im pretty excited just to dive into calculus
then i can get into differential equations
my university offers a multitude of stuff though
like linear algebra, number theory, topology, etc
differential equations fascinate me, i wanna learn about those eventually
if i put the same effort into my other classes like i did math i'd be amazing at everything in school, lol
not the best, but also not terrible
my ap history course for next year just assigned their summer project
it was invented when a supercomputer was injected with 12 tons of meth, 3 tons of weed, and a pool-worth of lsd
~~there are 20 pancakes~~
im just excited to read napoleon in america
~~who doesn’t?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
<:kappapride:379352530863521792>
did someone say bluej
like last day of notes and drafts taking the last page
what have they done?
my *only* issue is that this is generally the time in the yearly cycle that they start to hype up a main series game
bleh
okay, now that i think about it, lets go is gen 1
also we finally get to start with eevee
that'll actually make picking between the two versions a lot more meaningful
i never gave a shit about pikachu, the inferior electric type
i wanna come back to fun stuff to read
yup looks like it
buy a tv
actually get sarah to do it
but only one version
complete waste of money to get both
because gum doesn’t ban
and tries to help reform them instead
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
which kinda sucks too since i kinda need to rely on a phone to be in contact with my parents to know where to go after my lecture today
i'd assume the zoomed in radio beginning is to signify that this is a main game, not a complete spin off
e3 is next weekend
did someone say javascript
well shoot, ok
but i don't know much javascript.
oh speaking of which
good job twitch (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
photoshop froze on me
but you guys never talk when im here
i throw things that we don’t need out of the ~~hole in the wall~~ window
if we’re taxing people now...
but we don’t need it and it all goes in the ~~hole the ground~~ dumpster below
e!will
im gonna need to manually look for each 4+ letter word he sent and replace it with some shorthand
because i have no idea how to make an algorithm that will do this
nice
on a scale of one to stupid how stupid would "exploding footballs" be for a weapon type?
when i was in middle school i had a comic where one of the characters was a chicken who played sports
time lapse snapshot
make up ya minds, gamefreak.
and yes dragonite i put sovengarde and the normal main theme both on there
no idea.
ok so old format still works
405 songs recorded
its too chill for my chillstep list
i once won the jackpot on a deal or no deal game at an arcade
so at the beginning, i picked our case
and we kept saying no deal
i was in a squid?
well we know they'll still have trainer battles in them
hai friends ^w^
i played through firered several times and most of yellow once
nah i don't have a gba anymore
also, there’s one tweet i want to show you later about these games. i’m going to eat in a minute. remind me if i don’t 😛
yeah i heard about that
oh yeah
been a little while since auto pin kicked in
well my first ever book i own
must not damage the pages
well fuck
what’s 2+2?
did you even hear a word i said
it appears he did not.
c—a—n—a—d—a
hey master how do you say "football" in dovahzul
if anyone actually wants to see footage of my exploding footballs let me know, otherwise i won't waste space in the creative channel with it lol
i second this.
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
and you’re dragonite now, according to the bot
just unbind it and use the one on the mum pad
e!google shannon selin
eyan is starting the sequel to jersery shore
funny you mention that, that was what i had in mind
"now, you put the chicken in the oven at four hundred degrees for forty five minutes, and i don't feel like waiting around, so let's go play video games for a whlie"
i would be done if they made it too casual
ida has 132 hours on record in skyrim currently
the first time i battled harkon, my game glitches so i couldn’t kill him
"2018"
not surprising
particularly if theyre building a new engine and not forking an existing one (which they did for gens 4 and 5)
forgot about that one
oh wait do you mean one that i actually use?
meh i hate how all my plans have changed
i think this is the 3/4 time
i did once
squid your vote doesnt count
when i wake up in the morning, i instinctively look on discord and youtube.
i was going to say flubs' current missiles are probably more explodey but i guess not
have fun with the penguins, flubs
(－‸ლ)
wanna trash talk it?
exploding footballs break?
brb food
today's lecture was awesome because we weren't over a pretty important detail in calculus and im super eager to take calculus
so i was happy about that
how bout, no
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
n = o/u
and with that im gonna go get some more
push up half way you can do it
is the sea always salty because the land never waves back?
he said music was gross
oh no
no pink
yeah because my voice is fabulous <a:rarityflirting:447509240043667466>
as long as my pink is unchanged i couldnt care less
flubs you always join when im around
bc i have reason to
speaking of which gotta make more
haven’t had to use failfish in a while
hmm what to pick
and <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
~~does this mean rc needs to get taxed too?~~
everything looks the same....
had to rewatch my stuff and i did do a good job
i'm sitting here uploading july's videos because that's how far ahead i work because i'm stupid
he isn’t really my friend just a classmate
racist
time for new friends yes
that's a little bit gross
might have someone besides me not graduate
but didn't you already graduate
i guess
she has all of that besides science but she got an exception and she probably will pass her finals however she has two online classes that she is not done and if she doesn’t get them done she doesn’t get a diploma
i used to get called out of class just so i could go and study for it, it was bullshit
it was literally the same stuff you had already learned
is it possible to finish 4 units of grade 11 not grade 12 computer science in 22 days?
no if you dont know what youre doing
cool...if only the military was like what it was once wa
back in the old days everyone wanted to join the army
boy were they wrong
work
i must say, it is rather amusing to be looking for an enemy that turned invisible and then finally when they turn visible again they're having a seizure on the floor due to the paralysis thing
drago give me cooking advice
oh yeah, it's officially gay month
relatable
and you arent even told what is incorrect,just that it is "incorrect"
long games are fun sometimes
usually
by "compelled" i mean "dad was in a bad mood that month and i didn't have much leverage"
well, it’s going to storm soon. we’ve been getting too much rain lately...
im vlogging now guys
should be
what
i mean aside from the fact that you can only play online in 7 and 8, and 7 is pretty much dead
im doing a rare editing stint so ill join later, probably
join
i wonder how effectively i can do both at once
sarah is a fucking psycho. she ate into an ice cream...sideways. she broke through the top on one side and worked her way down and to the opposite side. it looks so weird.
i broke through the part on the left but still
eyan, deci, master, and panda are playing league now.
missed the rest of stream, apparently. oh well.
im gonna work on this spreadsheet for like 10 mins and then bother gummy about starting up another conversation
besides i'll do it tomorrow
since i am free tomorow
nice
oh ok
another spanish lesson that is
i give it 10/10
well the other night i didnt get any sleep
so after work
so i would have to show photo id and all that jazz and yeah i may never get the account back or i might get it back
also that separation makse sure you dont have any of the old stupid or edgy shit you put on the old one
albino umbreon
just in case i never get it back
so apparently im in charge of a vc tonight
quinn
i have to work later. right now, nothing’s happening
im going to yell at people today
exactly. games are a form of art
this was a dream, now?
and basically ruin it
flubs
is it rozen's skyrim album
your music taste sucks
noms natewantstobattle
gummy be nice
gummy stop hating things
that song is describing me piece by piece
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
i'm one or two shy in almost every direction but i don't think i actually have any bingos
something tells me deino is lying on his
that counts
whatever
good job
replay sun
gummy why dont you go read harvest december or something
that one
i havent battled in ages
k thats fine
i want to sleep, but i dont want to sleep
primaries
new jersey
gummy i thought i told you to leave your fishing pole at home
sleep now bye
meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
b/c vc
wanna join>
im also here but in a different call with friends
its never too early to be coding
for some people it is
this guy gets it
yeah blame drago
i actually changed it
i did it because i was in a rarity mood
um pimaster
you should know im a brony
anyways where was i?
and bring it into the illuminati triangle in the desert
random rare drop
personally, for me i would never even bother with the dock if there's a cable charger
what year/season?
oh yeah those are fun
im no private to you
right person, you thought wrong
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
good now i dont have to go into class because ill be spending the week in the hospital
while i enjoyed firered, i don’t care for kanto all that much. it has some pros, but meh
real fans root for teams that haven't won the world series since before they were born
squid no eating flubs’s lamb chop
gross
there you go
fiddlesticks
i literally dont know
i honestly don’t like muk
and only 1 line of ghost and dragon types; i never liked that
especially on short answer
essay? just write c
i was miserable doing it
well yeah
for me
that stuff
because those are funny
you can make one of those if you want
yeah but i feel like someone would call that racist really quickly
i love latin though
i probably shouldn't get too far into it but to give you an idea there was one hitler fan a few months back
i should change my name to something offensive
“drago’s boil water”
i got the diploma at the same time as the medal
what level honors did you get?
im tempted to go dig up the thing
they have kalens, nones, and ides, and numbers count back from those days
pr. is one day before, after that its x days before
they counted years by the two consuls they had that year, re-elected years were weird i guess
but a ton of people got cum laude
im in latin 3
taking latin 4 next year then ap latin
they were like "the sun moves over a day"
why did i even do this in the first place?
yeah...
she is my official helper now
just um dumb sometimes
omg your overlay sucks
i thought it was that some assholes got lazy and just sent the fucker to the future
unfortunately, i missed this friday
and overlay
probably no because that would require doing an e!all and discord will probably send a hitman after me if i do that one more time
i dont do it for the server. i do it so that only i can have onii-chan's love
temportal nightshade
how would drago be executioner
im a rogue with max dexterity and proficiency bonus in stealth. no one catches me
a good assassin relies on air existing around them
hence parameter in your lungs
but then i can just consume more oxygen
if not vision of them
the infinity stones have two parameters
oh memes are weird
asshole 2.0 is also a creep because every time he joins chat he sometimes says “how’s my favourite girl (there name) doing?”
yeah
and it's 4:30 so it's because i'm an idiot
nah just make it less spaghetti
ehh, not a fan of doimg this
does it not use events?
can it be done in java?
my bot is being developed in java.
not that i know of.
(long pause)
java
okay another issue with discord.js: the documentation is trash (at least on mobile)
you could use eris.
bella we are nerding
im procrastinating watching netflix
good job
okay the d.js stuff is now refusing to load on mobile

ill do this later or something
and we learned how to graph them on a graphing calc
brb gonna get some ribs
nice
makai if i know.
they were the only one that's mentioned it thus far.
i didn’t even know their was a dm in youtube
shh questioning it only makes it stronger
there
him being "dragonite's love life" implies that he didn't exist though
yeah you guys will have no idea where i got this name from
tempted to change it to "rc's love life" now
be more specific
mommy works too
okay finish chugga's video
subway!
i was going to make an overwatch reference and then realized i dont know any of those characters except dva and tracer
guess who i said
out of the whole list of heroes he was the oldest and well an interesting choice
i really wanted to say ivan the terrible though
o3o!
"speak softly and carry a big stick"
while some people wrote boring things like hockey player
i wrote down i was emperor, huge warlord, have absolute power, and my wife is rarity
im msging someone to ask for a price for a plush
we can talk about platinum
what’s the meaning of life?
rc gets what life is all about
why do we spend hours playing video games when there’s many more better things we could be doing with our time?
they make frantic gestures, they cant cough even though they are clearly trying, and/or they fall unconscious
send help
brb sleep or something i guess
hai friends ^w^
is anyone else not seeing comments on youtube videos because of "restricted mode" even though restricted mode is off
well yeah
id make a darwin project video but it doesnt work well with shadowplay
love how rc said don't go overboard
well you said something like thta
i am making bios for each pokemon lol
why?
im bored
it's currently the stupidest thing i am ever doing
i tried it at the beginning of one lp; too much work; i stopped doing bios at episode 4
and he has help from stephen (photoshop) and masae (art)
asshole 2 is blocked
garchomp and vaporeon as well
yeah i assume it was you with that one as well lol
well looks like im a pillow now yat
as a definitely oppressed gay, i demand these shoes for free
no but he pinged me telling me my name was mentioned
im bored and there are all of three other people in the room
save me
how'd research on d.js go?
remember when we were all a fun sized human thing, and now we're just boring? i remember
so are they advertising homophobia?
(sarcasm)
i've seen ads on neither cause a) i use adblock and b) i don't use twitch
it for my own video
yea lul
"hello, i like money" - youtube
reading that sounds like work
fine then.
i have teachers to be bothering about summer things to do
since my original plan was helping eyan get youtube back on track but it seems like thats delayed til at least years end
old stars
no thats star geezeers
dammit

for a video essay it would
because it's an essay put to relevant video
is that saurkraut?
horseradish mustard too
thats a hamburger bun
she went through a 16 ounce shaker of that powder parmesan cheese in less than two days
but like, does she just eat it with a spoon, wtf
cheese is good
*cheese* is good
this dehydrated milk and sodium blend is not
by refusing to skip
students
whats wrong about senior skip day?
they apparently don’t want kids to worried about finals and grad so they do grad first
but it’s nearly impossible to fail here
anything that is 50% or over is a pass
for us
and im quite sure that the failing grade was a 65
in my college, d, you pass but the credits don’t transfer
she has 5 units of computer science left so she can’t pass that
no because she won’t be done her computer science class flubs
ohhh i see
she might fail gym so 21...
whats your version of dont give a crap?
dude iss is the best
anyways time to go back to platinum work
you cant punish a student who doesnt give a shit about school
darn asshole can’t vc with me while i film
yeah, theyre looking at their phone. how would they know someone is talking to them if they arent listening?
or youre missing the button
or second job if you have one
fiver or something
its just that everyone in school is an asshole all the tiem
i havent been bullied since 6th grade, which also happened to be the last grade i stayed in a public school setting
i just didnt talk to people because, again, everyones a dick
in elementary that is
that's how little i cared about socializing
hey drago
come on
isnt shulk the zelda but a dude person
im gonna stop doing that one day
flubs do i have you on steam
wanna add me?
how convenient
one requires 100% headshots on enemies that teleport randomly in a game with bad hitboxes
help i forgot to switch onto my non-speedrunning version of the game
its so glitchy d:
and its so good to kill in it
too low
i wonder what dragonite's dietary councellor tells him during their meetings
we lost to the toilet of the major leagues
the marlins is the team that have no good players and are magically doing better than the m—never mind
whatever happened to that bad self-insert fanfic you were writing a while ago?
who goes the the cloud district often now?
psst, i know you who are. hail sithis
youre boring
i am always busy now
ponies like always
this time i said something along the lines that she would get fired less than a day
damn thats pretty...okay
im not nice
woah
gummy i like you a little more than the bubble gum stuck to my shoe but less than brussels sprouts
only ida likes me here 😭
the point of me being here is to annoy everyone
you only do public insanity?
only here master
when i am serious almost everyone gets scared of me
i dont feel like logging in on browser though
i made that avatar in like a minute and a half and im proud of it
they are talking about star wars
in xenoblade or pokémon or skyrim
dragonair and ????
flubs sing a song
the singer just fucking slows down mid word
well if all the singers do it then its a part of the song
sing gorgeous\
so the final score was 15-6?
i been in war with this person for way too long so must get a peace treaty
i just build the houses
how does that make an relative sense?
mine: 
work
more work
go home
being an idiot here
oh, that’s my day tomorrow
if football worked like that in america i might actually watch it
it would make things more interesting
posted a thing in blackbird
45 seconds in them: "alright please stop we'll remove you from the list"
i mashed 1
did you have music playing when you were driving?
and that game uses a butt ton of real songs
~~it’s because they aren’t good games~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
that’s why i said i **had**
~~if that was the case, i would be left with only 10 subscribers~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i have no idea what to do all summer
wait i made a list
"3d printer"
bring a flashlight
check back in like a month once i actually get some of these things carried over
hmmm
ya gotta believe, flubs
im just very demoted to memes and roleplaying characters
idk master is the guru of names
not if youre all thumbs
thank you for the practical demonstration flubs
i have to smash it against my desk until it comes apart by divine intervention
bleeeeeeeeh
i know it wont happen, but my ideal wish is for a pokemon rainbow with every region and all the pokemon
truly the ultimate pokemon adventure
wow i got into my stats class with 1 spot to spare
do stab and boom at the same time, booab, or stoom, whichever floats your goat
see he's ready
i don't see skarm fighting for glory, i see him fighting for no reason other than to say hey look at me mom
weapons of steel and no armor
and i like to pretend to be him
a lot of people used to be short
~~#needmoreyuri~~
i might watch it now
i'm biased, it has the word princess in the title
tastes like licorice
rc you suck
at this point, nothing is original anymore
rip i can't change my server nick to "dragonite - guru of life and laziness"
12 more days until the old gum turns 18
he misses being aggressive
and my profile pic
yeah otherwise gummy would be running around with a picture of upside-down rabbits also
going back to watching power rangers
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
dragonite you're a bunny
or 4
that seems like too much
for high school math classes i've been using composition books with 100 sheets (200 pages total) and for college math i've been using 200 sheet (400 pages)
same with my college general biology class
and im hungry
im watching the news about a killing husky
is that right outside the window?
yea stubbing your toe is the worst
yeah, watch your goddamn language
actually
im not named brad
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
kill him
thats not squid nvm
also did you level up recently?
while master is doing teh maths im also doing math lul
also did my precalc final exam today
when he has us do quizes or something, he grades them as soon as he gets them while also working on another stack of papers at the same time and i think he would hand them back out if the class finished fast enough to go over them before period end
nah already completed my required 2 years, but i'll still get up and exercise like i do so i dont die young lmao
at my school, you had to take 3 years of gym
im still on the fence of whether gym is evil hellspawn of satan or a fun time for all
im lucky enough unpaid gigs count as service
the majority don’t try at all
and like three hours later i came up with a great comeback on my way home and i was so happy
the <:kappapride:379352530863521792> pe teacher
yea.
want to do it to him?
today is international jelly donut day
i love me some jelly filled donuts
get over here
wwait
stream is going
for...reasons
wanna fight
bully
burn him
beep boop
fuck now you give me flashbacks to that sheep song
things i do to watch the new pony episode
it is now on hiatus
now i need to watch eqg shorts, finish tmnt, finish justice league action, catch up on teen titans go...im missing a show
and the color depth is amazing.
no no
i dont believe so
huh, no scratches. i should go play with the rabbit again today.

funny how i was less proud when i was younger but now more proud when i am older
went with the new york
nope
their numbers are about the same
woah is that pixelkmon
bottom one master
darn
taste like regular rocks
the blue jays are winning but it's against the orioles so it doesnt count
oh rip that was yesterday's game
idk how to read baseball scores
they are 3rd in al east
yeah the orioles beat us in both games gummy :^(
<:doit:334014889137930240>
i know
brb now food
i meant the commies
wait why is flubs in the enlightend
i'm teal you fools
well too bad
when im bored i leave or don’t say as much
actually eh
no flubs
the russian army mostly had peasants as troops, they only had 200,000 regulars
welp im stuck here now
five chairs
now you can
you can't tell the future? what are you? a level 17????
(just testing stuff)
flubs is a race
i clearly have minecraft open right now >:(
ban yasuo
thank
i’m killing rabbits in minecraft pe version
but i wanna go to 3 places only available in certain states
i heard they were good
fast food
who said we were driving?
i also am not a fan of cars
gummy i cant walk five feet let alone a thousand miles
wont this just slam my face into the ground
wont this just launch me upwards and then into a spin where i then slam my face into the ground
im sorry but my ugly fucking face is just about all i have going for me
i got her bugged in the one dungeon with the tiny platforms on the shaft downward
she was still following me in boolean but was stuck on the platform for like 80 load screens
i played chain of memories for gba.
it's awesome
hi persom
squid you're slacking on your job, you're supposed to give out baconators to people
i just got back onto discord
*catches the something* what's this?
pokes fish
it was in the baconator that you ate, majestic
wow, gummy just got destroyed
again
gummy stop getting deatroyed
microsoft and bethesda
caption of today
olay! wait wrong country
wait squid i could ve sworn your pictire was flippee
meaning of life? not worth it
my picture was flipped, but i changed it to something else a couple months ago. and now back to this because i didn't have the original saved
jokes on you i'm on summer break
im not : (
slow clap
it was the rival nickname thing in crystal/soulsilver
the only people who dislike each other here is drago and me
i don't think that's true
who said emile is here?
i don’t think anyone said he was here
so not sure what draco was rambling about
with the whole "the only people here"
anyways where was i?
and a gf thats helping with the depression but makes the youtube comeback take a bit longer
beep
i think sumo was kind of a last straw for him
and then questioning why he's doing any of that work
he blew up back then because of an algorithm change.
same.
stop making me feel old .-.
he used to do various video games
then he went exclusively minecraft and i stopped
why did they change that
pipe down gummy
hi bedridden im dad
also did i say 47? i meant 147, i missed a digit
i'm actually charles babbage's analytical engine
its not that he doesnt like pokemon
!leaderboard
yeah that
dont even attempt pink. it will destroy you
yeah!
most of us do
unfortunately yes
i did that on hg
i'm a purple i think
someone said johto
you can also solo the game with seth
good job id
i only did online stuff in gen 5
okay thats it brb
good job master
some of them are for pink nus, others are eyan memes
(◕ ε ◕)
dont get dragonite started on faces
socks are hard ok
blankets are easy
you don't put a blanket on, your put in over you
*throws a blanket over flubs head* shut up
see? doesnt even work for me.
it does if you ask nicely
hush it you
but i already said that about the 5 emotes
i love steak, it is great, and when made right, is even better
if someone has an answer to this @ me because i want to know also
"we need to talk,i want to despise other people"
blah blah blah /rant
woah now no need to cuss
since i essentially finished it today lol
i win. 100%.
i honestly dont know what that means but good job
im a marshmallow pillow
whats the difference between gum and marshmello?
marshmallows are softer
the correct answer was one is the predator the other is the prey
flubs
yay windows updated on me without my permission
except for the updates
honestly, the only game that i’m looking forward to out of what microsoft showed was fallout 76. but i’m just waiting for bethesda to give more information on it
after this, i won’t be looking forward to anything until nintendo
i feel like nintendo will either blow everyone out of the park or be a bigger disappointment than ea
okay bethesda legends isn't the same as tes6
crap i gtg do real life stuff for a bit, ping me if bethesda does anything actually interesting
that's a dragon priest
that tes6 is fake right
tes6tes6tes6tes6tes6
aqua
aqua
you guys arent funny youre just mean
i mean im happy and all but why
because porting skyrim to the pip boy was just too hard
i feel like theyre gonna pull something
like last year’s nintendo e3 presentation when pokemon for the switch was announced
might as well stay up all night because there's no way i'm getting any sleep tonight
bethesda isn't dumb, they know announcing something like 76 so close to 4 with no tes would stir some shit
i died when he said "iiz slen nus" and ice fell out of the freezer
after i beat them, it was like do you wanna loot or peacefully occupied?
also fuck
plus the *obscene* amount of money gtao made, i'm surprised we hadn't seen a clone yet
in other words, i'll buy it when it's cheap and hackers figure out how to hand out money
greetings, animalman.
also, i got the kh1 platinum trophy the other day
animal man is gummy’s son? <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
though he’s not the heir to my throne
i don’t see you declaring war on countries for no reason and looting cities
squid im going to have to euthanize you for that 9ne
ironically, this announcement has increased my desire for pancaks
<:lul:305559915714576385>
owo?
drago
thanks
and when they do they start doing dumber and dumber shit
the fuck you mean 3 am?
<<no i'm just a good liar~~
misc. stuff
the red?
12 pm
didnt reply to me in modlog either...
ooh where?
welcome
welcome to our domain
hello there
we’re a small group
so i have a bunch of tears that when i fire them stay in place until i release fire, and then shoot off as vortexes of death lasers and hell magma that explode
its a very fun game
master you officially have too much time on your hands
welcome to summer break
and yet i still dont get any of the stuff i should be doing done
gummy i swear to fuck if you burn down the pantheon
not my fault apparently the pope hates me so i’ll just take napoleon to rome and loot it
sooo in corphish’s server he has me listed as youtube friends along with other people. this one apparently has heard of everyone under this category but me
well i mean you dont have a youtube chanel
it says here only available in california, arizona, and texas
plane then
honestly it mightve been in utah. ive been to utahs capital and one other town north of that i cant remember the name of
beef?
ive had kool aid
the fuck is *that8
that’s exclusive
and really shitty
for the people that could survive in guantanamo bay
did something happen at e3 that i should care about today because twitter's in a frenzy and i can't tell over what
i don’t sleep
there's always the vods if you can't watch it
you can play wow by yourself too
but just dont play with them
i'm from the days when online gaming was in its infancy
can i explode your bones
or youll be alive, if you call that living
like i need a really good excuse for not doing my paper
but i need my analytics
kung fu panda is playing at the theater at my gym
at first i thought you were cheering for aquas questioning
ah. meant to type that into a different server. sorry.
i just love this movie
eating raw cookie dough is worth the salmonella
sleep now or something bye
guys
now time to plan out something really stupid that im going to do
wanna be roommates?
gummy, i will beat any toxic narcissism out of you so help me god
she sounds like a person i would like
gummy, i'm serious
narcissism is directly responsible for all human caused suffering
happy birthday, bella.
people in the live chat on youtube keep saying fortnite and despacito
i forgot i could do that 😛
its been free
on switch
so if the defense mode is on switch, i'll be pretty content
yeah, i too dislike people hating or dissing on a game before trying it
cause clearly epic got *something* right
i think fallout shelter is too, right?
woot time to go charge my switch then
albw zelda?
that'd do it yeah
you travel to sovengarde to kill alduin and eat cheese
not in that order
nintendo has won e3.
to the trailer pref
well it was all the announcments they just showed live.
kumatora and boney in lucas' final smash
i'm not crying
the stream chat is going nuts right now.
fyck yeah
smash is fun but i can only play kirby
straight up dont understand combos so i just charge myself up to 100% with kirby's hammer and then hit someone once and they die
but still i'm hyped!
and fortnite
that stage is one of the few things i remember about my childhood
nice
so, correct me if i'm wrong, but the inkling and ridley are the only actual new characters?
i'm not saying the old ones don't matter. i'm saying i've seen what they offered and now i'm more interested in what's new
i'm a daisy main for life
and i'm going to stick with mario kart. and maybe mario party when it comes out
so critical hit (lucina and marth) will be the exact same, which is great cause they're me favourites
only phony smash balls, 8 player smash on the smallest stage, super high spawn rate
or try to hit from far away
i was kinda hoping for netflix and youtube apps to be announced
i mean, i liked sutherland, i think he did a fantastic job
have a baconator newb 🍔
i will burn it down
im going to loot everything in site
no part
but cant he just not get the game
you'd think it would be that easy but apparently this little to-do has been raging for like a half hour now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
but like even if he *was* forced to get the game its free
im confused
fortnite is a sign of the devil is a new one, ill give it that
so, anyway
did nintendo actually say anything about pokémon? because twitter is strangely devoid of pokémon
also i'm pretty sure pokémon is the reason why they're waiting till december to release smash
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
any idea what this thing it goes over in the beginning is ?
honestly it's probably not work reading too much into it
math126 (pre-calculus i) midterm
i get that its an engineering course so it has to use the imperial system but i dont think the imperial system ever gave grades on a scale of 0-9
ember moon, mike daniels, olivia holt, and nairo fighting in smash bros rn
thats a bold statement
i don't think it was bad.
cake or ice cream?
nope
i didnt like nintendo this year. nothing interested me
of course ive only seen like 4
yes why
devolver hosted a streamer i watch with like 20k people so i liked them this year
one thing i hate: es6 overshadowing the rest of the conference
i already played a bit of that
i’m pretty sure there won’t be as much story and stuff in it
i never played a metroid game
yeah i mean no need to bash their fun
i know but being excited for a game they like and not being excited for a game they dont like doesnt really make them hypocrites
i only played skyrim
no why would i do that i dont play any games on it
i can understand why people might see it as more of a port than a brand new game
also i didnt play videogames in 2010 or whenever it came out
i still have my wii u as a paperweight
it just was pointless at the same time
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
sometimes, it feels like i have so many unpopular opinions, it gives me a headache 😛
what about double dash?
my first ds game was pokemon diamond but i prefer platinum
the gamecube was my childhood
i got a gamecube and xbox the same christmas
for not being faithful to the original
ct is the only major jrpg i've played through
or you could get a job <:kappa:374346980136058893>
my brother in law got me chrono trigger
some ask if i’m ok or if i’m in a bad mood
dude having a job is awesome. you can just...buy shit. its great. the not great thing is taxes and rent and food and medical bills and bs like that
because people complain about the credit card readers
do you know how many times i have to repeat how to use it? its fucking irritating
like theres no way its *not* gonna get stolen
86 years old
its a different one yeah
e3 was fuckin boring
intel also showed off a liquid nitrogen cooler i think
so, not only did nintendo have their splatoon and smash bros tournaments today, but apparently fortnite has something going on. ~~we can clearly tell what everyone would want~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
the guy who you don’t want to mention?
one let’s player i watch will never play a pokémon game because he thinks the series is stale and repetitive
and this was just from me reading a fan site; i never heard him say anything from himself
i think fan games were just part of my “rotating interests” 
i get really into something for a couple months but then lose interest and not care at all
bug/ghost.
good job 🎉
speaking of which 18 in one week
what do you expect me to do with a bowling ball
this guy gets it
tomorrow will be worse
you're going to accidentally fall into the grand canyon
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
corphish had 85% control
kingcorphish
well im kinda not in the mood for jokes
today was pretty shitty
he probably feels ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
my bot learns from the best
the bunny is drago and the crocodile is a brony friend
and flubs she isn’t a robot
actually new orleans
i saw a simpsons clip of all the famous foods in new orleans
i prefer ancient orleans
yeah but it only works if he stumbles over it a lot and just randomly pauses before really lackluster punchlines
make him a war general
they told me im obsessed with warfare
also, squid,
want to voice chat?
destroyed 8 ships and captured 2
go to military school
*gives bella a yo-yo* have fun
it wasnt that hard of an exam, but still, it's my first college exam ever and im happy bout it
54 miles to london
nice
apple sucks, pc is better
my bday is coming up and i hate it
i turn 20 never
thats a lot of math
so the thing should've been sin(t)/(1-cos(t))
muskets though
so, when does the splatoon 2 octo expansion actually come out? i already pre-ordered it, so i’m just waiting impatiently right now
we own the land, we own the planet
why does it have to be an animal?
idk show me a plant or a bacteria with a deed
how can we own all plants
theyre on our land
then what gives us the ability to claim ownership that the dinosaurs couldn/t
well it hasnt
so we own the land
yeah people have to agree the land is yours. which you prove with a deed
what does our agreement actually do?
```js
function flubslogic(){
    var a = a + 12 * (3^a)^2;
    return flubslogic();
}
```
ok, it looks like the octo expansion does have a midnight release. 😑
go there if you hate government so much
i think it’s out now; just checked twitter
woah the first assassin creed takes place during the third crusade
move it 5 feet to the right and it would be fine
~~but they need inspiration for you know what~~
what are you party people up to
pfft
wow cant believe em. kappa
starboard it is
isnt that just calculus
haha, yup
aight cool tried four different emails and finally got it. thanks for letting me know when theres no account linked to the email, ea. love ya
night
buy now download on the pc that can run it later
not to mention the lesson was extremely confusing with backwards grammar rules
dragonite are you in the steam beta?
it feels... console-ish
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
this is non beta steam library
can you buy things for me?
i just wont eat for a day or two
gotta say
when im using my steam controller
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i am the warrior of jolly ranchers and you shall bow you little twizzlers
i played it for a little bit this morning, but i had to go to work. and now, i have been catching up on youtube ever since i got home. now i can finally play more again
and that was a decoy house. for the times that someone might blow it up
not an answer
also i need someone to play world of warcraft with
you should get it, it's really fun but insanely addicting
who's reposti?
his name is "gallowboob"
hes the real general reposti
that name is ridiculous
i thought flubs was a group of people
well its also a species but thats unrelated
i love cold brew coffee
just like me
i have a new evil enemy
the portuguese...
since the rest of my troops were in russia i was forced to sign a peace treaty...i hate the portuguese
the portuguese man they killed 1:6 of my army
i just remembered: i have a saxophone in a closet and i haven’t played it since 5th grade
i see ninety six, not counting the last one
it’s been a while since that clip was shown
picturing master's sister flying out the window now
that does give me one idea
oh careless whisper is playing let me get through that first
i wish the characters in the train had more to say
ok, i’m going to try and complete the car wash level for the full cake thing
it’s like rosalina in super mario galaxy 2
thats 2*6
pistol. don’t try the others with short range
error, no end of statement or something
and don't throw me out of any windows
would you be willing to sell it to me
slap them
why cannot you can not?
no seriously reread what you said very slowly
spaghetti
what isn't happening?
majestic spaghetti is overthrowing the bourgeois
youre asking why i cant go slap the person playing music
bop it, twist it, revolt it
what kind of hit? a punch? a kick? a brazillian style roundhouse?
its my extended family's annual summer meetup. which means i die tonight.
i can give it for like five minutes
i'll arrange for that
flubs bad news
but yeah, after this i have no reason to ever see any of my family ever again and could not be happier
i have one cousin who plays pokémon
it's yelling
yeah and honestly shes the worst cousin but one of the best people. i have a pretty horrible extended family
why didn’t i crown myself king instead?
in game or irl?
*(you're paying for the ammo)
besides last time flubs came in um
things blew up
no he called everyone bitches
no shit
out of context pin
requirements for a pin
-must be stupid or otherwise ammusing
-must make no sense or have sense
a new royal anthem
is there though?
ok, now i’m bored 😑
so is unity and unreal
wait might be calling it off
yeah i call bullshark on that
flub flub
oh you got it up?
i did the name change for the sake of keeping the right day part number
it's cool eyan, no worries
that and if i were to join i would be maxed out already lol, max bard
~~don’t~~ blow it up <:kappa:374346980136058893>
also are you cleansing the world evil?
i said me lol, i'm in pre supreme calamatis
can i just interject to point how how nice it is when my code spits out error messages
but then sometimes it works fine and i have no idea why it's rendering a teapot as this:
this has been a psa. back to your regularly scheduled madness. thank you.
hey, i was going to eat that chicken thigh
a really cool mount too :d
i'll probably never touch an mmo
it’s poisoned with something
holy shit had a dream about eyan uploading again
just mug old ladies
eh, just leave him against the wall, he'll be fine
also dead
im bored
no you cant
nope thunder
there was no overlay just the top screen and bottom screen and a black background
real men do let's plays with their phones
never before in my adult life have i looked so forward to the holidays lol
i want the most bullshit environment ones like pokefloats, the spinning metroid one, and big blue
the menus in smash 4 were a mess imo
smash 4 menus weren't the best.
i doubt it will
i hate clg and tsm so much, i have no clue who i want to win this game
ghirahim
fun fact, i've never actually played skyward sword
oh i see.
*speeds out of control and runs over flubs and into a wall* i'm herreee and ready to parttyyyyy.... oh fudge i ran flubs over
i bid thee farewell from the crime scene
annnnnnd gummy changed his name again, who would've guessed

coming from a person who failed to put the apostrophe in "you're"
how many curses are seven lettrs
oh my god flubs

c e a s e
i had to im sorry
oh hey it's rainy
i'm just a blue organ so you don't see me much obviously
both me and rainy are in stephen georg’s server for patrons only
oh, i just rarely ever see you say something stupid put of bordem so i assumed you were rather relaxed
if anything i thought that because of the purple name
and more often then that, i'm bored
pretending to not want to die is a full time job
and it pays very poorly
if acting like i was an idiot all the time was a job, i'd be rich and not be working at walmart right about now
i'm just more active so i can attain red galoer and be haopy
eyan is still a higher rank than me
you don’t have to
this is true lol
of course you sellouts would think the common folk are insane
~~don't answer that~~
so my teeth hurt today so i had to rely on swallowing most of my food
tends to be how people eat yeah
no swallow without chewing much flubs
hehe
tell me
the roomba
and why not a goomba
i wanna play the piano guitar thing
my only skills are day drinking and sleeping in

or did i just miss it
yall remember so much
persona stuff, you probably wouldn't like it there lol
majestic thats how memory works
i remember flubs shoving his mic up his colon but im pretty sure that wasn't on purpose
i don't think that's how memory works flubs
natural selection has failed us
how has it faild?
it's only in place for lesser evolved species
only up to i'd argue 2001-2
anything after that is when common sense died in it's entirety
hiya lol ^w^
and yeah i am alive lol
btw told you camelot 2.0 will be successful master
hey will

yeah there was, at least what i considered to be, the original people
speaking of gummy he changed his name again
also as it happens they're not losing but it's only the third inning so there's plenty of time for things to go wrong
unless you like it that way
ε=ε=ε=ε=ε=┏(;ﾟдﾟ)┛

wait, gummy is into dark-skinned waifus?
rc, i think you need to get that eye checked. it’s unusually big
there's like ninety five conversations going on at once in here and i can't hear any of them
my mic is on the far side of my desk because there's literally no other space for it on my desk because it's a disaster
hey 9k, can you change e!rainy to "cease"
e!crash
it was previously "stop shouting"
ionic or covalent?

so apparently my power didnt go out, i kicked the surge protector power button that my computer is connected to
im the smartest person
or the random access memory to remember what is going on
and i felt like making fun of them
pokes will
playing 100% orange juice.
make fun of my videos ida
but here’s what i sound like
well ida did say she didn’t know what i sound like and now she does
nice people. brought me a beer.
does any country not have an independence day nowadays?
it uses location so it would for you
i have a song stuck in my head
and i can't get it out
it's...the abc song...
i watched a dude rob a gun store on liveleak yesterday
but my finger slip so it was jk
(－‸ლ)
it scares the everloving shit out of me
for honor is free on uplay for download if anyone wants

i have embraced the magic
it’s too quiet *blows something up*
monday. busy. work. hatred. blugh
i dont have a degree in anything though. might as well start coding i guess
she does not approve of me hurting others 😑
idk who but i did it
<:rarityflirt:447907828187922452>
both are kinda bitchy at times and apparently i have that trait as well
what>
ive never seen the show
i see ida as twilight but don't tell her that
oh i did that with some doctor show a few years ago
like an actual doctor show
i would say try it...but it doesn’t seem to fit you unless you are willing to go through a whole season
welp didn’t win anything from the scratch ome
at my place of work, you will see people spend so much money on those and usually not make that amount back
i'll be learning all about trig, polars, conics, matrix algebra, vector algebra in about a week's time
so thats cool
i mean statistics would have you round to the nearest even number, in which case he'd have been unofficially eighteen for a good six months
rounding is hard
don't be an undesirable person
am i undesirable?
i was hoping for a better troll response
now you’re getting it!
also about some rapper dude on twitter as well
hey gummy remember the time you found a way around the at-everyone ban?
that wasnt really him finding it as much as not following my directions, the much easier way to do it is through the other thing i showed you drago
yeah, but i was trying to avoid outright saying it in case anyone got any smart ideas
detroit is an objectively better game but the ending is a little heavy handed
putting on new pants and whatnot
hello there
i think he was the head of admin of the forums actually
guess i better take benny out again
but i didn’t break it yet
but it’s good
i had a good bday though besides not winning anything on my scratch ticket
i didn't do anything
idk if that’s an insult or not
twitter
just gotta figure out drago’s bday and troll him im twitter that day
since she hugs backs
its fine as long as you keep your socks on
im pretty sure there wasnt much sfw stuff in there
you could have done something like this
nope
actually i will start giving care bear references here
i like the one where gummy goes outside and gets a life
ah good luck bear
i like grumpy bear
pokemon go is fun
neither can i
or the sequel on the switch
i never took the ap exam in the one ap class i took; i just paid for the credits
mount and blade warband napoleonic wars
i sold my console for pc parts
very bad
hey squid 🤚
i recently got my old gummy spirits back
who scared him this time?
you terrify them
i only  terrify my closest friends but they usually know how to piss me off
maybe that one
for once?
hmmm
watch an episode or something
same buddy
hey! i didn't get to that part yet!
i'm a bunny rabbi
idk master
you suck
ida i'm taking away your television privileges for that
what's television?
you learn from your mistakes, master
also cozy > compact
it wasnt a mistake
on the servers where people constantly change their colored roles and nicknames, i dont bother
my desk is literally covered in loose change that i can't be arsed to take to the bank
or you can be like me and haven’t played anything on steam since i uninstalled it years ago <:kappa:374346980136058893>
sounds like an antivirus
i will be winning the attendance award this year
bad news, i "had" french fries
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
i didn’t get “drunk” but i definitely woke feeling super tired
is america the only country that has the drinking age at 21?
18 in alberta, manitoba, and quebec
i don’t think russia actually really cares about their age considering their vodka consumption
africa
i like italy
history's for nerds
is london the one in france or england
england
~~how about weebland?~~
okay what about japan flubs?
jolly old shit in the streets
antarctica
i wanted to go to antarctica
well now i dont
huh...why...
because i cant go there so its dumb
too green
the name is a lie so the people are all liars and i hate liars
hmmm
okay what about west virginia
why flubs?
ok, how many times have i died now?
gummy there are only a handful of good states
can’t believe you hate florida
practically canada
oh she’s been hitting on me the day she ask me out in grade 10
but that was her latest attempt
your state sucks drago
florida is good in the sense that "it's not new jersey"
you know im not going to let you compliment new jersey to that degree
oh so you went to the not populated places
or whatever the fuckin quote is
new jersey is great though
lets go to canada flubs
i post one gif like usually and new people decided to spam images in the general chat because of me
past tense
sleep now bye
okay superheronerd
or rather your showing-id addiction
it’s not an addiction
that's what they all say
just this ticket will win
any cooked pasta is good
haha master no. raw pasta is superior. raw, unshaped pasta
free money
all i had to do was show up to school
i just don’t like the large jump in levels
i got gud
wait
that’s how i feel
the rival is better
i prefer hugh over cheren pretty much being “i have to get stronger” almost every time you meet
wrong channel but good job
i have a showing id addiction
(－‸ლ)
i nommed a lot of things
because i never heard of that word before and i don’t know what it means
you stalking all your friends with it?
games tab in friends thing
click top left icon
lmao
i kind of want to try that but at the same time i don't because what if it doesn't work
and procrastinating homework
random stuff
*noms sock* tastes like chicken
cant be bothered
i hate friendship
so if the sun were to explode that would be a literal disaster
like honestly there are better ones than ours
the seasons are crazy there
something somethign im kicking my butt off discord so i can actually write this segment of a paper bye
use wikipedia
fine then
rage face
its just math slang
and thats on the complex plane?
so at least the sources are fun to read
pokes flubs with skyrim
i think im going to go back to my paper now
then its not a virus now
why not just play the one thats on windows 7
i mean its detail enough
what would the baby look like though
so like does the letter matter
i have backup from the source
shit
well misty tells me i have a gambling problem
no misty is the gym leader of cerulean city so to answer your question, yes
that doesnt make sense
i knew flubs was addicted to cocaine
and that still sounds better than my writing calia
i should go on it then
i want dramatic music
13 reasons is awful
it pisses off my classmate
maybe should have gotten yelled at but whatever
i had enough teenage drama irl, why do i need more of it on television
exactly
i just hate it, but listening in on other people's 'issues' and 'drama' can be really fun when you're not involved
batman the animated series and superman the animated series
the new batman adventures
static shock
and batman beyond
static shock and the zeta project
no kappa. what does it stand for
and no teen titans is not in the dcau

i havent seen a single dc thing ever
wait is the flash dc
im watching it right now
dude he has such a punchable face
running isnt a team sport
theres no second place in running. theres first and theres last.
it takes a lot to be a good runner and if youre winning you can be an ass
so i am going insane
eventreturned;
hes a meanie and he killed a lady
killing ladies is bad
who the hell would buy it
flubs
i will gift you
gift me what also you cant
and no gummy
nice try
help i cant stop eating ice cream
theres a problem there
walk to it each time is kinda hard
that's now how procrastination works
im done being productive for the day
just a general hatred for life, y'know, the usual
well bs that final
my bsing is pretty good
what class
you counter it with alcohol, the higher the proof the better
yeah, then you can set it on fire
its a collection of sabers from fallen jedi
although im not sure how many of those fuckers managed to have purple or red sabers
make your own
yeah that can't be fixed
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

and the braggart named ragnar was boastful no moreeeee, when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor
now where'd i put that rumstep
sometimes i think i need a third screen
coudl be worse, i could be writing this on my phone
(he's bronze)
ouch
but yeah my gpu is able to do higher quality on it and it looks just as good
i could keep it on a different desk but i’d want to keep a theme and i don’t think a desk from the 1800s would match anything else i made or bought
260 words and counting ;-;
public speaking is also overrated
i thought about writing my thing about that but decided it might not go over well with my teacher
stop
play it
no i saw one with things like witcher 3 and gta in it somewhere
>adc has top damage
you need to stop gambling *takes gummy’s money and runs*

maybe someone needs to ban you from playing the—oh wait that;s waht they _want_ you to do \:thinking\:
im taking benny for a bit
my dog

im done for today
what in the sweet name of flubs is elementary vector algebra
its only one of the coolest subjects in algebra
but it uses matrices to find the cross product
i was up till 4 am last night just dabbling in some vector algebra and polars
you think thats weird
eyan streamed yesterday and probably will next week on friday
yeah it's been a long time
i was barely able to pay attention to yesterdays stream my schedule has been not so flexible
right now he's pretty busy with his current job and doesn't have too much time for gaming, but we're doing a terraria playthrough on fridays
going for high end right away or just straight for something cheap that can play a decent bunch?
hello there
its ok, you still have time to ascend to pcmr
i play the spreadsheets
hey, i love the current meta
i will also never be a pc gamer
hehehe
fuck yeah
stop being old
stop
never use it
theyre fun?
streams are not fun
relatively lower on fun scale
booleanreduction counterargument: no
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
why am i the only one who gets hurt?
this guy gets it
i wasted about an hour of my life on league and gave up on it
dont worry, the client doesnt work either
it has crashed my rune pages at least 5 times now
good job
those were interesting days
and when you mentioned floats on pc ratings, we just use mod sets for that
oh i thought you were refering to that one guy that wrote fanfiction about eyan
yeah
damn now that reminds me of scatman
nice level up message
e!kill master
there we go
hey master remember an age long ago where we wanted to _discourage_ violent roleplay? :')
we have one slot
i do wonder how many of those were me leaving gms running over night, to be fair
oh yeah and minecraft is <:treason:396483914803445761>

i didnt do beans to the user join event, that's all on you
except i made the wrong event the first time
no youre not
i think it needs a few more role playing games on it before i actually spend the money on one but that doesn't mean it's a bad console
right now all the (exclusive) rpgs on the switch i can think of are xeno 2 and octopath though
told me he would pay me to help him with it
drago get a job
but i also hate people
you did your first one for free
dont you know anything else that could be useful?
sure he does
otherwise you would hate me
just look at his code
maybe a week
im going to take my leave from this conversation now
no she knows
because she was cute in your eyes maybe
it was a joke. i’m sure we all know that 😑
i said harder, not less hard

eat...liter...what
how much food can a food hold doesnt make sense
so, like ice cream, it makes plenty sense to measure by volume
thank
you arent making sense
like a 1 liter bottle can hold 1 liter of water
it's how much space something takes up
what if its hollow or not really dense
mostly
hi, i'm your mom, i'm everyone on here's mom
because im a stupid
that one was dragonite
and for gummy just go off of his picture. his name changes on the pretty much daily because...reasons

also fun fact, my mom just started supply teaching high school this year
we have a ™ button

it has been requested that we route this conversation over to <#311411150611021824>
here in general we just talk about depression
or me
and by that dragonite means we've had that pokémon gen wars talk like 20+ times already and people are sick of it
there can be two moms, jesus christ it's 2018
also wait if rainy is the mom then wouldnt there be two moms
it's like the whole zeus, eyan gave birth to all of you through his brain hole
zeus got it on with a lot of women didnt he?
i think dieno estimated either 150 or 300 women
classic barry
the newest few at least
well yeah

london is in england
the old man from pawn stars has died
why are we attacking drago gummy

not using c++?
i forget what it's called
if i do i'm gonna pre-record all my lines on tts

10 mi ute presentation on why schools should teach computer science more

a lets play does not.command a two hour block of my day
quiet bot
signed in on a school computer now, let's see how long i can do this before the teacher notices
idk but ive had interesting luck with that so far in this school
rude
well you know why he said it?
carrying the other people you work with in a group assignment is oddly satisfying
silly rc
could be worse
or have any book recommendations for me to read
either of those two
for cs? i know of books, but i don't know if i'd classify any of them under the heading of "good"
yeah he was like one of the only authors i read wililngly since harry potter ended
my mind just cant understand doing two things at once
so its a lot of things going on at once
ahem
legs are good for things even if you cant use them
sorry gummy is just rubbing off on me
flubs is your dog superman
it's about as complicated of a definition as the average program that dragonite writes
gummy help i'm turning into you
does it take effort to read this
what the fudge is that
everything
its called google sheets
and appears flubs
excel is just google sheet's creepy anti-internet cousin
where do i put down my resume?
you are supposed to wear heels flubs
no im not gummy
so wassup frens
hai majestic
boooooooooob
guya im gonna be covering all of this tonight
yeah i'm out
why must it be really active when i’m busy?
get all the suffering out at once, math and allergies at once? suffaaahh
*throws math out the window* i don’t need this right now
watchmojo
nicholas the second was a dumb ass
you mean the only possibly way in which dragonite could score more than about two dozen in a bowling game?
man there was nothing like wii baseball
thats where youre wrong
well yeah
there isn’t boxing and baseball
know what game would have made wii sports infinitely better?
twister
destroyed the french fleet
we want mario 64
my scripting language is hereby known as "orange"
powdered mini donuts are so good, let me tell you
i was starting to think you hadn't received my message
they're good
he could save others from cheap food, but not himself
oh boi, sneaky back at it again with another cosplay
oh ahit
oh, and stephen is going to meet mal in canada for something
congrats!
well i've got some years to go
now i can have time to watch batman with the asshat
she is awesome
this ought to be a fun read
yet you do it and make it look easy
oh boy
nice
much curlier, and benny has brown on his ears
i would hire an assassin
assassins are a dime a dozen, i'd just do it myself
im just hoping my group members got 100% too
i just found out we’re on the 15th anniversary of the room coming out
cant record replays tho
i remember that one quarter i got a 100+ in a class only to discover that the report card generator took the min of the actual grade and 100
my report cards don't do that i think, mine would register as a 101 or whatever
had it happen to me once
im the dumbest person i know flubs
because we're not dumb
why is barry fucking his sister
that show turned to shit, i stopped watching
im at the part where we know shes gonna get dead but she probably isnt gonna get dead because plot
same
solving in general is my cup of tea
oh, never heard of it, lol
kugal it's really good, the first two seasons are amazing
arrow season 5 recovered briefly
but only because
he did but then plot bs said no
worst hacking ever
because time paradox
and future
he was
it doesnt make the show better, it just makes it confusing
who were the contenders
oh yeah
if youre afraid of spoiling the arrow dont worry i will never watch it
supergirl is bottom of my list
or barry as a character, idk which. either way hes a dick
who’s sara?
im watching a dude tell hes sister hes dating that shes gonna die. he isnt a good person.
thea is #1 i'll stand by it
nah, kara and sara are both my two least favorites
aight cool so explain how season 3 ends
and guns
except og dr wells
legends never had a truly bad season
and nothing but
never even watched supergirl
couldn't get into it, don't know why
im like halfway thru s1
i'm not getting ice cream but just let me say that i usually just get vanilla
wait flubs did you say ben and jerry's in town?
have yet to go to the ben and jerrys place near me in a while tho
super common near me
i figured out why she didnt eat this one
its abysmal
（。_°☆＼(- – )
i said pasta
flubs was talking about a show
yeah because they suck
anything is better
almost one year anniversary of something every big
the day we decided to flip off some dude over the big water
july 12 is when i first met you and bunni
i guess you have been though. bad gummy.
id say your death would be quick and painless, but id be lying
fool.
one more day of class and then im _actually_ done for the summer
indeed.
i dont have a source on that though
plus if you scroll up they replied to someone who had pics
but like why do they need to do it that way
you join the skype chat around july 18-19 of 2016
i will need to recheck but i never had a reunion planned
oh, i don’t see jello that often
hiya
just finished high school
awesome
and those sandtraps always get in my way
if you feel like traveling halfway across the country or something
gonna go get a sandwich
actually my road trip might not be that bad because i get to see my pokémon-playing cousin . . .
i dont play it nearly as much as i used to but it's probably still my favorite franchise overall
pokes with stick
foooooooooooooood

same buddy
i'm magus, it's ok
i do need someone to fight him lol
i resent that statement
july 12th will be one year of me meeting flubs and bunni
it’s rotten because of stupid events that happened
chuck will be still memeing at his funeral
i miss your dank memes
ill delete it if its beyond the limit
do we though?
zeal is supposed to be the apex of the world or something
so darkness is limited to magic or something
you already have all you want from previous events as well
i'll give you 10% of my check
oh yeah thats true bella. we can just get him fired and still get paid.
but that's just a part of life
you wouldnt have to dread going to work there ever again
i lose and lose
hey man just because you cant get hired doesnt mean you cant make money
brb starting a pyramid scheme
no master not a pyramid scheme. a *multilevel marketing company*
i dont feel nervous or really good
you got this kugal, i believe in you for the most part
the exam looks like fun
he’s 8 pounds
the summer semester is over
how much time left on aws?
can't be bothered to switch to d.js?
correct
divert 1% of bird game to d.js
i just know the dates
like today is bad luck day for me
you died?
so it's badluck day number 4
actually it's personal so i can't talk about it
i prefer complaining about the asymmetry
guys
i insulted drago!!!
hee hee, gummy said "butt"
that butter replacement is better squid
now that i think about it i can probably extend the hello there interactions a bit more
if you can't run a 1996 video game you have some issues—oh you mean the new one
```_pokes ida with a stick_```
i wonder how many of those are in there
```i like all boobs! all boobs are good boobs```
_looks at bella_
i have quantum distortion cat blobs
when your the ruler of baconatorland
did i miss it
only because i play so much mario kart on switch i wanna see how good this guy is
but yeah, prey fucking sucked
how many people care?
i have a bunch of shit connected and im on like 40 servers and nobody has ever bothered me about any of it
more of a '100% all items / achievements' kind of guy
yeah me too
speedruns especially interest me
it just amazes me what people come up with
vista
i never actually played dark souls
its not the kind of game you can comfortably play with m&k
whoops
fire is ida’s thing
it was a machine gun
and?
yes he missed
and montauk is the fucking worst
the french wanted the brits to shoot first
they wanted france to shoot first
you mean
that seems more like letting your rival pick a pokemon first
the french were cowards after napoleon’s empire collapsed
napoleon is why all the european flags look the save
so we are basically brits
then the english did
it's not as complex as people make it out to be, it's just who do you want to date, and who do you want to fuck
either way napoleon would have had a little but of a laugh if the u.s. took canada
because russia
nah spain was what was the early reason
it is, and i'm winning
i am the senate
which would've been so much cooler
i touched a piece of the wall that was in berlin once
and hope it catches on
of course
my family is from france
did i tell you i almost had french citizenship?
im sharing memes with friends
sooo yeah
give me a sample one
oh i see
ok show me one that isn't
now it's a civil war
idk what i'm talking about
annnnd i'm freee
im freee im flubs
good
foooooooooooooooood
and by general public i mean people at home
i know that wasn't the point of this, but i think it's fair to point that out
i apologize for my rant there, i just thought i should express myself
i’m pretty sure they were playing the wii u version or something. did it ever say it was smash ultimate?
i realize all of that, i'm not gonna get into every little detail there
the one that plays music is over there
what do you have against chicken
they were at one point original
such is the way of htings
but if hes animal and man but man is animal is he animalanimal or manman
manman sounds like a good superhero
he can create other manmans out of his manmanhands
im not human
idk, try poking him or something
shut up i like my version more
but you cant be animal and man
animal enthusiast who is a man
and yes
drago make it active
drago you are in charge of it now
no worse
also youre not cooking youll make the steaks horribly
hes drago's evil twin that doesnt make puns so thats actually the good one
rc you liar
who said i was making steaks?
im not eating that
flubs imagine you are on valley forge and starving
all you had was that
play along
i eat like a soldier
yeah *replaces airbag with potato bomb*
shush
also i keep reading beef taillow
also my video editing job got delay
good job
to catch up on teen titans go
i just bought 4000 pieces of puzzle so cats aren't allowed in my room till that's all solved
thought you had it on the floor
no stream or server today, small chance for monday
flubs
wanna hang tonight?
and squid sounds like a stoner
no offence to those two as well
i have no clue
which is kinda similar to stoner voice
4000 pieces just means it'll last longer
do you not know what a stoner means?
....
painfully so
fair enough
my bacon for baconators...
gummy your last message was literally a picture of bacon
<:keepo:327304799919800321>
well i guess you wouldn't go vegan if you were in it for the taste
they might've changed a few things since than.
as with many products
i remember something else i used to eat was a vegan product, but they changed some ingredients and well it ain't anymore
i like music
mhmm
nyet
do not sleep at me
whats the old folks home
but i do want to know
mhmm
drago gummy called you crazy
wait so he straight up told a dude how to deal with their child
well damn
half of conversations are fun
you arent gummy
hide the pain harold
and its almost been a year since the best day of your life
3+ hours in now
good job
which isnt equal
well camelot 2,0
horrible server name
the fuck would i need moderators for
infernal knife?
people have a reputation of getting murdered here
but it really isnt that bad
carry a flintlock pistol with you
or a glock
if i make myself to apparent i will get mugged
its open 24/7
i know but i can minimize my chances
chautauqua
i got one honor for this
traditional news outlets think anything that’s animated is for children 😒
so what your saying is we need to seize the means of news production
no no kill the old people. old people hold jobs and say mean things so just remove them from the equation
and blamed it for making a kid commit suicide
mate people have been blaming things for suicide since the dawn of rock and roll
about halfway through last year
now i’m just waiting for the bbc/ddlc memes.
dear god
thats 6 million exp for that level
a gummy's afternoon
why did the game grumps recreate a meme format
i mean itll happen to all video games that get popular eventually, it's just a matter of when
is fortnite turning our children into satan loving cannibals? more at eight
any press is good press
i had just a minor defensive reaction to it
okay
but he hugged me
the 12
welp
you know what
animal man you should really get that autocorrect checked out
cause we're better than that
even when you don’t like someone you shouldn’t say it out loud
we know
but i needed to teach a friendship lesson today
<:ironic:307345212328509442>
do as i say not as i do
why are some of the sabers different
interesting
i just like leaving though
but you wouldn't last
publicly existed? i was there
before the server existed, camelot
boom
i guess he wil
of course
it's bigger and better
something something wookies
no they are abusing the bot
send me in
we are talking about a server
well i assume some of the ones i talked to are there
hence the bitches
still didnt answer my question
what bot
flutterbot
which one
nice
master
if it has better cooling, go for it
wait
did alienware glue those in or some shit?
upgrade
k im on a budget
ram is good for me as well
you will
the case i have rn i got for free from brad
mid i would say
fair enough
there is still a new motherboard and power supply
it sucks
what’s a good mid tower that isn’t that expensive?
just go on newegg and look at cheap ones
here i’ll dm you links
that wont cost you more than a mortgage
unless master wants them here
yeah
cad money is different
looks nice enough, isnt cheap enough to be made out of plastic but not expensive enough to be made out of platinum
im going to end up blowing something up
intel® core™ i7-4790, intel® h87 chipset, 8gb ram, 120 gb ssd and 2 tb hdd, 8x dvd+/-rw drive, dw 1550 802.11 b/g/n/ac wi-fi + bluetooth wireless combo, integrated realtek alc892 codec, and a gtx 1050,
ram clock?
ddr3 pc3-12800 non-ecc (1600 mhz)
for this league game to end first
not really
oh wait
thats 3 not 2
how much video ram on the 1050?
just make the earth flat to avoid time zone related issues
notice the giant 2 gb in the top left corner of the box
i just saw that
power?
im looking at motherboards
instead of atx
currently some msi ones
nah case upgrade
case upgrade which requires new power supply and a new motherboard
did something go?
two front usbs won’t work since there isn’t enough power ever since the hard drive upgrade
anyway im going to be in an automobile for three more hours. master know any good shanties?
i can’t remember any shanties from ac4
*throws one piece out the window* too many episodes
i cant remember the rest of the one piece beer song though
shots fired
should keep me entertained for fifteen minutes
i'll make a partitioned by --- version of the doc
the thing with e!commands is that nobody uses them after the first few.days
except for like the crash one (me)
so other than that, how's everyone doingm
hey master
how does that look?
if it says am3 or am3+ it wont work with intel
cpu model?
all i want is a new case, power supply, and motherboard
im not changing anything else
i needed the generaion
mid tower
gum gum the dum dum for psu get the cx 550w
canadian link pls?
you want side window?
if candyman doesn't show up on independence day i'm going to demand a refund
my sanity
what's this? i won't be getting it back either way
that seems a bit more than 5% of the time but hey, rng
drago is a she?
oh i know what happened
gummy i think those are isntructions for what to do with you
