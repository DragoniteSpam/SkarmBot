maybe i should watch less anime
ive been banned from a server from my username
wolve can i just not breath through my nose within a foot of you or something
you don't want to wait until we fight bosses?
waking up tomorrow is going to be a pain, it's always more difficult in the cold
that means you swung to attack.
do we need a heart for each upgrade?
i prefer using my mobo as a gpu and cpi
i have no idea what the heck is even going on
i though drago said fashion for a sec
right, it's apparently because of latency, because i tried a singleplayer world and had no issues
fine fine
so i'm going to blame overhaul for my lag
it was, ida.
yeah i love running dishonored, but dishonored 2 made me want to die. its all so random
it changed my keys
🤔 do you think the lag has something to do with the gore?
i'm not that stupid to do it in a rage
just a reminder that 3 diamonds are needed for the storage heart.
currently -23 here
gummy i will destroy you if i have to
<:PCMR:305892755014418435> 
\:thinking\:

what is it stuck
hmmm interesting
quup off
his brother recorded a dead man
what?
is makeup
its like how i have a lot of pictures of pregnant luigi
it has music playing in it
it's not that easy
don't want to burn out too quickly after all.
i need to take care of things irl tonight so i don't think we'll be able to have a session tonight.
wait wtf
hopefully once we get some more life crystals we'll be able to take down eow faster.
uhhhh
he isnt a child
hey gummy boop me, for, uh, science \*cracks knuckles\*
or slightly behind because effort
that should be accurate
and your name is rarity now
if you buy it for a year you get two months free
oh no i didnt mean the food
my pasta
get that checked out
yes ida
okay, i suppose "everything that isn't literally illegal and bears some semblance of safe for work"
none of us have any knowledge in morse code, so we wouldn't understand it
i don’t even know what that is
now i want pizza...
anyway, i have to go to bed no-- hours ago thanks to time zones so bye
fine but if i go to bed before then i expect you to be honest
make games
benny has won a total of $10,000 so far
flubs tell them about benny’s casino luck last night
that’s the word
i can't tell who raised the hand on mobile

christ, and it takes like an hour to launch, too
perfect ida
heh heh you see what i did there?
breaking dirt
??? it's already 1 pm
have you been mining for ore in the depths biome also
i might only have 1 class on tues/thurs also since i'm thinking of dropping the public speaking class since i took another english class that i thought gave me credit for public speaking
i have one pencil tho
as far as i can tell it's just an in-house sequel to meme run
so id rather have 4 extra years of trying to get a job than 4 years of working up debt
all of my interests are video games <:lul:305559915714576385>
eating it
i dont really care what quality its in
i could tell they were being flirty also
*the world isnt that black and white! from my perspective, im the hero and youre the villian trying to stop my valiant plan of setting the entire population on fire
so i dont like the beach
because it is soooo important for me to self promote myself
high school me was cool. i like high school me. bit of a dick but eh, everyones a bit of a dick.
good
talk about that
those are the best easymode wings you can get your hands on with thorium
yay my uk friend finally woke up
we need to defeat him so that i can get bronze alloy fragments from the marble enemies
waffles or pancakes
and we're still in easymode
we died so many times to it
caffeine is a drug
then they're a very messed up family
minus ore seeds.
if you know you definitely took everything, try to think about other things

sooooo
i poked my fan with a pen and it stopped not running
i meant blackmail becoming blackma- shit nevermind that doesnt work
wait you guys actually think that's actually that bad?
ate 1/3 of the one in that photo during dunch today
let's just say it had blackmail in it
i never show it though because i just mess around here
because she did the forcing/blackmail
i mean, i would just go and consider that an alt by technicality, but details
oh yeah just like ww1
that’s just really black and white to see it
previous mistakes were repeated
oh trench warfare is wasy to understand
the sad part is, the businessmen back home were profiting from all this
peter the great
i can't at this point master
i don't know.
i see her bestie giving her a second chance though from what i have seen
it was probably the fries that gave you away
spooky
haha! you cant block me if i destroy the discord servers!
also, did you try fighting skeletron already?
if i wasn't, we wouldn't have been able to beat the bosses.
although i just lost connection
e!says-add i don't know what to do, its working!
not like the npc is going to be useful to us now
good time of day.
i was expecting ice cream tho tbh
i also got a granite boombox.
-spirit
-calamity
i don't think we could even attempt doing death mode
ah yes, the bees.
krelian, please. ^_^;
it's fine, wolve.
like the soc.
i'm kicking overhaul out for the next server
it used up every single free bit of space on my drive

i can imagine the banner having stickfigures in it now
it's follow
canterlot equestria
i'll tell you about flubs pm
speaking of playing, we just beat plantera in our game
you have a biased sample
and bramble i guess but i bought that like 5 seconds before we won so it didn't count
it’s not
not that, you ninny.
bass
its a rating of how often something appeas within a given set
heartgold and soulsilver
just walk away slowly, animal man.
good luck on that
it's pokemon black and white and according to drago black and white was amazing
ayyyy
some dude with long ears walking around
rc wanna see the full pic?

bollocks
oh fuck
that isn't me
owo drago hitting his bad bot with a rod
are you talking to me in the last message flubs?
the paul brothers are loud. you want more of them?
and who cares if it’s fictional
they just subbed to me and followed me on twitter
i am tempted to add you now so you can meet them if you know which one it is
fear
idk none of them ever sign up for my forums
in her defense cabbage burger sounds really, really awful
and than just use one of the other picks till we have enough for another one <:lul:305559915714576385>
i assume this gilgamesh dude is your waifu ida
~~ill have fun hehe~~
well not only birthing
they just don't have electricity in the siberian areas where it's happening <:keepo:327304799919800321>
i already explained it to like idk
but nah, gummy, as much as you want to help everyone, remember that it isn't your problem, as bad as that sounds
money chest
antiaris is being made by the official tremor team.
the way overhaul changed picks annoys me like how it annoys ida
the hallowed megaphone
but tremor itself is being maintained by someone else.
jeez i didn't make much progress there and i'm already feeling tired
a rarity plushie and a tricorne/bicorne hate
that's peanuts at our point in the game.
midnight?
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
(the one problem with that is i'm trash at modeling robots)
ho-oh
idk never played it either lol
i.e. spreading jungle to fix our corrupt jungle issues.
i think that's calamity
its gotta be true
i thought panda meant me for a sec lol
my favorite kind of idiot is the guy who goes on webmd and is convinced he has x horrible disease. what the doctor says doesnt matter. he has it. minor foot pain after hurting your foot? brain tumor. ate too much and your stomach hurts? 5 ulcers.
henlo wolve
i haven’t played overwatch in a while
do not participate in the life ruining juice
i'll record a gif of it once i get it looking nice
only it was for like 10 minutes
now the npc is attacking me for no reason : (
classmate rolled his truck after drinking and driving
at least say she
rarity pkushie made in the uk
i lived my life trying to get good enough that i would be worthy of her
everyone said it
just not as much as actual smoking
im bored
when you least expect it
not the fictional one
honestly knowing me since i can’t fit a mlp song actually i might but i am leaning towards a military song
physics is evil
just stand there while everyone dances
no, it is literally the opposite
hello.
i reversed your message
you know rainy is right flubs
b/w was meh. the sequels are much better. x&y was bland. oras, i like but i definitely prefer emerald.
that's not pony stuff
in the newer generations they kinda made red a pushover
gummy its totally bc its you
platinum was the last game to have it
at least she thinks im lovely
we all did
that’s photoshop
and maybe add a feature to have us remove them without having to go into the logs
ahem ahem *cough* enlightened ahem *cough*
coffee drinker
that's the smell of nature, you fool
even the decent ones are just not realistic
i kind of gave up once i realized i'm the ranger and ranged weapons drop my fps to shit
im almost tempted to rebrand now but have no idea what it would be to
it just might overhaul though.
its in
that's a good idea.
they charge money for use of the mods content.
how'd you even get it?
ehh effort
well thats on you for not seeing the future to this exact moment at age 6
reee
so if i had to guess
save the portal for next time
good to hear
nothing happen to me
currently alone in a very empty quiet hallway
2 was meh
college
yes rc go ahead with the snarky
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
i’m still not there...
honestly i’m not as big of one but i’m excited for captain marvel
gummy what you gotta do is get close to the person, then once you learn about their weaknesses just take them apart point by point until youve deconstructed their whole life
more than you
your feet
yeah me trying to pogo myself onto my desk using one hand
e!will
how do you do that thing where you split the sheet in half in google docs so taht you can have two columns of text on a page?
seriously my cabinets have chips and other snacks, my drawers have cookies and other desserts, and my shelves have high quality spices
i watched the trailer
idk why my classmates made a big deal about it
i can't find my stress ball
it's not a kingcorphish repeat
so asshole was an asshole, huh?
i have like 0 friends irl and im 100% ok with it because irl people are weird
i’m at my nephew’s 3rd birthday party and there’s several kids. i feel like running into a wall

kappa

oh but dont let me stop you from streaming every minute of every day for the rest of time
whos to say i wasnt born in 1700 though
it's a loot magnet from luiafk.

a rydon
no you....
this clip is a very low standard for both faith and a very high standard for humanity
she was having a nervous smile
11k gold in the bank
why is there an actual currency based on garlic bread
how the hell did you get that
garlicoin, actually
i really question the use of math sometimes
but im not about to fucking wall mount a third
because i'd like math to teach me the practical aspects of it, and then have something else give me critical thinking skills
so all the other consoles and pc can play together
i have tons
y'all just hatin
is rarity an old lady confirmed?
they weren't stupid enough to not learn from their mistake tho
cs4 might've been the latest version i used
im 5 11 but have tiny hands and feet
my parents dont know what patreon is and that';s probably a good thing
i just wear shoes bigger than my foot
i know, with the money i have, if i had to start paying rent and other payments, i wouldn’t have any left
i can't stand that stuff
i was responding to stuck's last message to me
urgh, i should sleep too. but this is the first time ive gotten to write real code in a few days and i'm trying to fight the withdrawal
that’s not a lot
brb screen break
get to it
if things end up going to hell when you and cadance have that chat, then i'll just pin it on dragonite
greetings, cadance.
because i know for sure no one will get it right, even flubs
may 29
i might end up with a 50 something in bio today as well
if mr cadance ever asks me again why i like rarity, i got a list.
shockwave flash rarity?
i see someone tried to murder squid again
...what?
just the next 20 billion hours
like this
yay guys
more?
computer
i always read "defaced" as "defacated"
hey guys i have an idea
like
or maybe it was alyssa
mine would be a remix of nuclear fusion.
how about, god save everyone else because we're going to need it
the windows 10 hard drive wants to confirm alll the integrity stuff, exactly as expected
its not like exp decays
fuckit im gonna try it
oh no im not brave enough for politics

but like...its gonna get hot. and when its hot its loud
actually, going to her concert in a couple months 😄
e!ida
really weird
herhaps.
i'm still in pre-hardmode xp
if you wanna cover your tracks besides aren you should not be friends with your main account
but yeah im done finals and stuff
yeah, we do
i'm not going to be held responsible for the death of the bot
some previous test subjects have been able to. others not so much
it reminded me of you
damn it
"the funeral is at 6:00, please be on time"ypoo
too late
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
besides that dude from pokemon
doesnt help me figure out who tf owns the discord beta testing server tho

owo this is interesting
well ida we are nice siblings
great now i have self-confidence issues
maybe it was like a proto-proto-proto-proto-proto-proto phonograph and they just slapped on the video later
"genious"
did i miss something
the case shouldn't affect your flash drives like that
but when you type `main` in with a capital m you need to manually input {} later on for your code to run
i want a muffin
or would that one warrant the gpu approach?
i dont want those nsfw ones tho
you need a 3ds and money
that was her ice cream
you have a lot of liquid nitrogen
i'm honestly more excited for that time around since i'll be playing gunner xp
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i assume you are talking about your grandma, and if you really want her to shut up ask her about m-81
mmmmmm the ground
i don't want there to be too much lag
how about that weather?!

eew gross why do you have poewrpoint and onenote pinned
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
fibus lusec wecos vinosec
and that's just one item.
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i needed that after dinner snack
thats that to none
in a holy shit my mouth is burning but i'm also hungry kind of way
and while they use modern guns they actually wear colour uniforms
thats how you are supposed to upload now on twitch i gues
like i said
now it's a force schedule your video
everything?
how many views
we already know what you're gonna pick tho
this is shaping up to be a good story, i don’t feel powerful
good
this is the kingdom of zeal
so i don't have to do that ^^^
you already do, ninny
even with a job
probably could but this dress is expensive
also i came very close to mistyping "weilds ass" which would be a sight to see
you are not joining
i would like just enough to be higher level than gummy
you didnt change your number tag yet
why do i have the bad feeling he's going to abuse that emote
it's not this video is a test run master
i do
you really like to steal doors, huh rc
:spinning: x3
i wonder if "greater masa mune" will ever be a thing. <:thinkingking:325447327940870145>
it's fun
how dare somebody play my champ
~~one of us. one of us.~~
i'm afraid to join vc xp
when
basically a color override.
i'm sculpting models right now, squid.
i wonder what other rank ups could’ve been
you killed my father
did you see the pic rc?
<:thinkingsteps:396534879833292810>
!rank
get the chat to fight and blow things up
i see.
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
the world doesn't revolve around you, gummy.
it is
wait thank god squid is now pink
~~dont worry squid, i never will.~~
henlo shade
he’s going to die
remember magic wand
flubs
i arrive back
i love hnnngggg-ing
figured out how to make a brachistochrone in excel
that too lol
what is with all of the icons
oh hey, you're dunban now, rc?
another eagles touchdown
nothing, like that
drago is the winner
darn
my tradition is just not watching the game
damn misspelling...
so before i went to sleep today i figured out the formular to graph a brachistochrone and ive also added 2 new features to the bot
skarm is always either violent or lewd, i'll have you know
e!bot
i tried
what game is it?
if i was going to get an emote it should be more me this time
adventurous
~~what if you don't know what race you want to choose, wolve?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
no its a color
a bit of both?
dammit (follower name here)
i don't really have any followers tbh lol
they let you on phones last year in spare
he's too busy spending two thousand hours in terraria
plus a server which is connected to the dm
my catchphrase is better
ok i got a new email to redirect all my college spam to... took me long enough
pot meet kettle, gummy
did i just walk in on something here
that's not good news
i never guilt trip you
it's fun
reminds me of myself
or twenty
i might end up leaving
you gotta sometimes make the call that a community would be better off without someone weighing it down. that's not a decision you should have to make frequently nor take for granted but sometimes it's what it comes down to
oh wow almost like i have experience being an asshole
i eat babies
no no lets
okay well now she msg the dm and idk if i wanna say anything or keep quiet
goood gummy
but drama is fuuunnnnn
or pregnant luigi
i wanted to be blue :c
plantera is one of the bosses and you break a plantera bulb to summon it.
the adage is "half your age plus seven"
the bot is taunting me
im no friend of his
never most likely
how goes things?
let me guess: same person?
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
how are you?
um thanks rainy
because flubs is more fun
i'm not fun
not true;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
i probably have a cs, latin, and pre-calc test all tomorrow
could be worse rares
enforce strict equality throughout the entire source code.
officers!
and that too
oh, and there's also the devotion of time and attention to acquiring knowledge on an academic subject, especially by the means of books.
wow before premiere it had quality options
keyword: should
i had one once
i think ida doesn’t like me now 😛
anyone here have a good recipe for pizza sauce?
i will never understand why anyone like it. unless you are a poison type lover
ida what else do you thinki do that’s a waste of time?
great suspended turned out to just feel annoying for me
no one talks to him
banked garlic bread from ~~scratch~~ raw ingredients
notice the "man"
dazzling is next at school then
every kind of doughnut violently smashed into one megadonut > all alternatives
kaiser
doesnt mean he cant react with them
love being the hypocrite here
i thought it was fairly obvious :c
brb looking up how many joules are spent in an hour long bike ride at fifteen mph
new super mario bros ds was another option but i done the let’s play 4 times and it requires the bot screen
heh heh
i reset the game
programmer art sound effects
so i just made some more pure gb today
it’s been more than 15 seconds since he last said something
no one but me
archive them somewhere or something
you think we should hold off for updates?
i’m nit picking probably haha
whelp.
im allerguc
in that case the response wouldve been very carefully
close
your advice worked
you didn't ask for a good explanation
also kicking the creator of the bot on that server isn’t a good idea as well
use sylveon lol
no squid that’s inappropriate
said you were
however if i do choose a new pokemon it will be oricorio
drago loves me squid
and they want to outplay inflation in profits i think
no dont expect nothing. expect idiocy and explosions.
ahh starting week count on monday
and hey you have bad apple yay
i guess i missed the part where dragonite's name was changed to 'screw you master - guru of screw'
why do i have to be john...
until you quit this server?
i like the diving events too
drago
because youtube
some of them are obviously better than others
all the mods are gone
you dissapoint me and i leave now
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
huh?
and russia
yeah
can't believe they out them on normla muskets in the 1820-30s
i know rc thats why nothing bad should happen
im too busy trying to sing chant du départ
i mean if worse comes to worse (i have no idea if i used this right or if it's written properly) you could always use the *"legal"* roundabout method of installing windows. although, idk if you can do that on a laptop.
also happy valentines day and happy singles awareness day! :seoxyslove:
time to scramble
i just checked and i think it’s getting close to 20 more
everything alright?
him and mal (his wife) do show up in the discord server quite a bit; at least one of them, once a day
<:treason:396483914803445761>
not the greatest.
and thumbs up had its own glitch
“prick”
i didn’t. although i was feeling slightly more upbeat today
i thought it was all in good fun but it was actually meant for me to feel bad
fuck you too
i already promise not to have a huge freakout ever since the october 8th 2016 at 7pm incident
i have crystal and there is a reason why they made remakes
same
okay then
ill throw one ultra ball
why did nintendo do a poor job on vc emulation?
maybe flubs but i know how to handle most of the situation
asus
i do plan on catching legendaries in unorthodox balls when i get to usum
can i get ban so i don't have to jump back and forth to different servers?
ah man i love hidden items finding to found it its a fucking x-speical
i mean he's practically banned from this server anyways
i can wear that and shake my tail
what do you guys feel about randomizers
it just has this charm to me i don’t know
my dogs are sleeping and im so jealous because i want to catch up on some more sleep as well
-31 here
conflict?
i could have done 1804 or 1815
yes it was dumb bird
now it feels like the bot is being sarcastic
what kind is it?
it's not that, it's just that my internet is going to make things a pain because of constant buffering
there's another good response
welcome back, aqua.
when i wake up its a blank slate of "~~where am i to go me johnies~~ no idea what to do today"
nope
oh that makes sense
kk cya
dragonite, smack him with a frying pan if you please. =w=
that would be funny in real life though. "oh i cant walk because of those 4 swords longer than my arm strapped to my back. forgot about those.
that is ok
and i don't wanna do a sidebox
that... doesn't answer our question.
no kill me
how do you drink pie?
lmao theyve all been taken over by the hawaii missile warning thing
what’s life? isn’t it a game? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
doit
we need a quarantine
true true probably when i get idk 1000 views...likes that’s going to happen lol
amazing how many costumes he can layer up
possibly
seen the escape rope fail yet?
i said me, you ninny
you know who was also a good tsar?
welcome. have a baconator 🍔
oops caps
all caps are great
also a few milling subscribers and a thriving youtube channel but that's beside the point.
this is what i look like
namely, her.e
whenever people ask me whether they should do this or that in a video game i know nothing about, i tell them to "follow your heart" works every time <:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
wow, grade a english on my part
and now it's rubbing it in. <:lul:305559915714576385>
what was i being thanked for
ask my classmates
i’m not drinking anything
madness
and they don't know anything else
（。_°☆＼(- – )
well don't throw up in here
funny how a jerk friend tried to convince i really was a lady and that my brain was telling me i wasn’t
explanation please
\the adventure one is sfw
i do wish he could just chat here once in a while, but i guess he’s too busy
i don’t speak in cursive
wait shit i firgot to approve all these first
frickin captain colours sounds better than that
i see.
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
theres a few good ones tho
the battle is starting soon
so many scottish accented voices shouting "think you can take me?" in my head right now, this is normal
it sucks you in, i know that from experience
someone help
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
waffles
no but can we talk about the non food pancakes. theyre better
i can't
that sounds stupid
my throat now really hurts
actually better than what you called me yesterday
i spent most of my time on the internet on cartoon network and nickelodeon’s websites
<:hellothere:305560404715896832> dan
are you texting and driving, first of all
at least make an effort lol
live footage of eyan deleting friends
<:lul:305559915714576385>
not a name i recognize
not a fan of steak either
i dont even remember posting that
wow i am not ban in his twitch chat
i wouldn't willingly order it
i mean where did you find the news?
nice
you starting to suffer from sleep apnea?
like overall student's eoc scores raised by like 7%
it is beyond my comprehension how someone doesnt like salmon roll
live is a cross between like and love
that good?
e!dragonite-b
raw fish?
awua
i mean there's probably a way to program the bot to remove reaction if it was added by someone else
pay eyan $5 and that'll be a yes
i question how effective that solution is
you have to look really close and cross your eyes and poke yourself in the face with the arrow tip
enhanse
idk about htat one
never thought i would see this day
over yours and corphish's dead bodies
i've always gone for water starts on my first playthroughs.
i was only 1 then
man i quit the mod job
that went well
well go do it then, i'm too lazy to do it
sleep is for the weak.
you dying?

well i get it
oh...
(late)
also on the subject of ports secret of mana just got a steam remake, anyone know if it's any good? (it's getting pilloried by the reviews)
it's referring to samus' mother-like position with the baby metroid.
"hey!"
they could just be lazy as hell and just make it a 7th gen port
i'm calling a delay here, it still seems too early
i also like just drunk ideas in general
it's like that one tradition where an idea has to be approved while both drunken and sober to go into action
wait i havent added taht
<:pcmr:305892755014418435>
good mentality
it is
there are 9 words per sentence
hai everyone <:hellothere:305560404715896832>
and that’s not green
that wasn't a pun
or alternatively: looking at the abyss
they're glitchy
skarm, no.
and then all the frogs float into space <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i cant get food out of my fridge

dayum
oh darn i missed a stream
again, are we dealing with the bot or gummy at this point
good
possibly
but there are two people dedicating their entire lives to fish
they're waiting for andi to donate so they can ban gummy.
it's been fantastic
i won't be able to disconnect the two for my entire playthrough
"shouldn't you be making headlines by now?"
honestly i kinda believe andi would do something crazy like this
~~are we eating chicken?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
but are we eating the chicken?
im weird
iirc
okay was it the bot or the game that dragonite was referring to, in terms of the image.
even talking about treason is treason
time to ask everyone to follow me
flubs?
i should get it, but again...lazy
you can stop with your pickup lines now
i said dragon, not dragonite
x&y has always been hated
it's just getting better and better.
connection issues
congrats
i'd pay money to ban this entire server just because i enjoy anarchy
definitely
gen ii is still my favorite.
however oil has prevented gummy from hearing much
oh and fries get a free pass ofc
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>

hey will
skarm sound the drums of war.... japan is going down
a dog didn't explode the mailman though, a giant mutated lizard did
is it part poodle part moth <:kappa:374346980136058893>
maybe. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
rest well then
time to level up

you're changing your name back to gummy? that's good news to me <:kappa:374346980136058893>
my mom’s birthday is friday
i have no idea what that's supposed to mean
why have you been doing that up to now?
no skarm turn yourself in!
only reason im not aggressive in civ was ida telling it’s not a good idea
that took years to make
and they started asking me advice
(drago, put an icon on your alt, you lazy bum)
yay!
you caught me

i return with cake
good job master (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b

youre in love with a pony other than whatever that one is called
okay, i just saw a skyrim mod that turns the dragon you find in helgan (the name escapes me at the minute) into charizard.
....drago
i think
damn

skarm knows all
well im france and france surrender after the napoleonic era
turns out, if the subs don’t watch x amount of videos as they come out, they just straight up don’t get notified of the video
i enjoyed my time with it, but not as much as other entries in the series.
but they are at war with me
i try to have a 10-7 sleep schedule.

whoops
yeah that’s how you spell it
panda sneaking around
correct.
or we eat out
how so?
i talk about characters and people i find pretty looking
the best thing i can make is a first rate ship
is there a good mod to make the guards dialogue slightly more realistic in skyrim? because going from "pst, i know you you are, hail sithis" to "let me guess, somebody stole your sweet roll" to "what is it? dragons?" doesnt seem quite right
greetings, bella.
alright. i’ll pm you mine
remember screw the brits, screw the danes, and fuck prussia

sarah ghome food in mouth yay
i almost said detonator but thats silly the detonator is in the bomb
and i already saw it a couple times. i am subscribed to him <:kappa:374346980136058893>

im not looking for ping time

at least it kept recording
i thought you could just type throw error into a function?
my league client has failed catastrophically
okay, that's kinda great.
so it's a name pun.
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
wolve, you're a grnius.
:feelsannoyingman:
uh oh.
plus, you can’t take pokémon out of certain areas until post game. and the 2nd and 3rd games have side quests
~~but you could use psyduck~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
later, squid.
wowsa.
and it uses jpeg images
its a collage of 3 images one of them being negated and all of them being mirrored diagonally
but why do physics gnomes make sleep?
boring
terraria: a game a lot of people play that i have no interest in <:kappa:374346980136058893>
it's the perfect pink nu quote
i got a really good paxel and scepter.
now that that's over with, can i wipe my rank and start over?
because they feel like it
you mean loot cubes with a mob spawner?
was there 8 of them? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i died for the xth time. good thing i have plenty of max revives that can’t be destroyed or taken away from me
by the way, wolve.
hey, i was going to eat that squid
oh god, he's lost it
remember kids, always make the best use of your situation
and we're done
same, how do you think i got lvl 90 lul
random thought: ok, so for lunch, i had a chicken parmesan sandwich at one restaurant. normally, it has tomato sauce on it, but for some reason, they put some sort of meat sauce on it
but does a tough battle make a good character?
oh yeah another great thing about the db

the fork is a weapon. it deals 1 damage and cant be boosted.
"if it ain't broke, don't skittying fix it"
yay i got occlusion culling to work
it cant be eaten
work is never fun
correction: if had some entertaining features in the netcode
ehh, i'm no bitch unlike apparently the rest of the internet, i love the snow
i just got back from work
and no
that's what i thought
what story
good, it's working
oh dear
the ocean one?
i never play competitive games though, i've always been a solo player
im confused now
i’m back from work ya ninnies
like what?
shoving off to sleep, was nice knowing you, etc, dont burn the place down, etc, etc, etc
unless his discord username is different now.
too bad this is fireproofprooffire
if i have kept all the attempted footage then i might've considered making a blooper reel at the end of the video for the heck of it lol xd
step 1: open the computer
100% oj, 2d game.
and now im gonna feel like an asshole when it turns out he had a perfectly valid reason not to come in
you got it
reminds me a little of world of final fantasy with the chibi-like characters.
ughh, i have to do bleak falls barrow to do the civil war?
argonian?
fucking bullshit
i feel like my eyes have been opened
you ate some thing edible
thats how high up we are
tell the physics gnomes to stop fucking around
seems i must have my 50 million tabs of terraria wiki open again
avicii was just found dead
<a:peepocheer:422063843938926602>
*shrug* the instructions said not to
is it bad that i can only assume that's m.website programming?

butter luck next time
it deletes a quarter of its messages when  there are more than 8k messages
no, that is incorrect
this is healthy
is there a problem with 5 minute intros? because ive been working on one i think is pretty nice.
someone enlighten me on how that qualifies as a "meme"
it's because satire's not actually at all different from what it's mocking
and to answer draco's question, i didnt feel like having it pm me or routing it to a channel in the log server
sounds good
i know
well, this was ~~boring~~ great. back to work...
well i found my 5 weapons to go for in pre-hardmode.
okay, just wanted to make sure it's fair game even though it's in another world
good luck with that
ahh, i get that from eyan
hmmm
until next time, gentlemen.
hint: the middle three always evaluate to "true"
save the flubsing the place down for flubs
thank you kind sir
okay anyway im sleep now
lol, got a clam cane farming for sea stars
good job
when i started, i didn't know how to screen record
well i like luigi for reasons other than dabbing
no you just havent caught up with death yet
although i broke that trend.
but i don't feel like editing video
you fit right in here. =w=
won't have to do those things for another year
jsut started derivatives and theyre fun
do i get another trophy for level 60?
just the one.
we didnt do much abs in precalc
for example on the ti-30s if you type in -1^4 you get -1
the formula was n² + n - 1
but when n = 14 you get 77 which is composite ;/
it's confirmed, there is a 2nd spaghetti
then you should try engaging more with your viewers in the video, giving a question of the day (kinda like what eyan's done in the past)
hang on
why are we talking about trees now
assholes need lessons taught to them
that is new
so clearly he knew he screwed up
if you were told simply to disprove a formula's ability to only generate primes then why do you need to make a new formula with the same objective?
he made me face palm so hard
yea, fun fact i never named my chanel after him, i was trying to be original but still naming myself after something related to space
he was trying to say how much of a hypocrite i was being, when literally i was doing nothing hypocritical in any regards. granted i could've articulated my response much better, but still
or given my personal rating
hotball is undoubtedly the best in the world right now
though i think my days in the game are numbered, since i dont want to get a 144hz monitor for just one game and one game only, and i dont even think my laptop can run that type of monitor
looks like java doesn't care master lul
hotball1 is, to date, the only person who's ever beaten bloodbath on 60hz
and by that i mean ill do the throwing shit at it for you
how would you plug that in?
now we just mash ctrl+k once we dont have any error messages
speaking of things going horribly wrong, im glad i bought a new mouse today since the one i have now is starting to work worse as time goes on
alright, cya have fun

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
oh wait no thats just the weather balloon thats on fire. the sky isnt on fire

*kinda*?
that doesnt make you any more sane
i'm more used to people referring to it as 2π, in math
just finished physics class
yeah close enough on the zeroes
when was i supposed to learn this shit
can’t we just talk about video games or something entertaining?
as opposed to the double-precision one
it'll mostly be the mermen that are the issue
im back.
my dog would probably let you get away with that, too
anyway brb off to physics class for a lovely lovely test
maybe. that was 7th grade so i *might* not remember it
it's great
<:lul:305559915714576385>
it’s 6:15 and it’s still pretty humid out; i still don’t like humidity

oh no
ah hah
i’d do it if i felt well
and then went rogue.
oh great!
happy revenge of the 5th everyone <:kappa:374346980136058893> is that even a thing? my friend who loves star wars said that so it must be, it oughta be.

i just hope that the first time i meet any of you irl that my first words are "listen here, you little shit."
private static final char m = 'm';
well you don't perpetually speak musketreason, not here at least so that has to be at least partially wrong
my tavernkeep in terraria is named blacksmith
yes, but then the trash will return and still need to be taken out
so when does google make a nation and we end up in some dystopia where they own everyone
it seems we are at an impasse
i’m back from work ya ninnies
i love this
do you what?
for once you didn’t collapse something
i’m back from work ya ninnies
and only assholes do that
mmmh
if i qualify then i'll be able to take pre-calculus ii and introductory physics in college this fall <:feelsgoodman:327315048252833793>
well yeah

hahaha
so you do want to knowm
thats true, maybe we'll get a gtavi within ten years then

shhhh
i kinda wanna frame it
nah rainy they were being crazy amount of bitch
it's 1:30 in the morning and i'm documenting my code
no, square the temperature
what do you think?
did someone say math lesson? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
fuck
then you are safe

go faster than camera take picture
and i thought i worked out a lot lol
the flash
yeah, i think that’s important
see but next year we’re ditching and playing d&d
something about technicians
* what went wrong:
what here needs modifying?
could not determine java version from '10.0.1'.
sure csi shows misuse it but its not the word's fault
slow clap
it could also be "enunciate" but that's only a thing i have problems with
lol bob the builder
tell the friend to make games too
anyway if i can wrap my noggin around github ill let you poke through and make fun of what im working on
real java meaning notepad++ and cmd/
i cant remember how it works now though
im a doof
welp
3+4=5
so tomorrow can be like a testing day for me
it's not
i think 5-24-25 is also one
i like casios but the rest of the planet likes the texas instrument
oh gorsh
why?
yeah but 500 people will be watching...
youve been thinking to much, time to start doing
it was thanks to war that got me in this mess
im just not gonna show up
idk who to pick though
so far operation: one small thing is falling apart probably because it was a dumb idea
same
yeah we know
as the game has no ending
sometimes relationships just take time to heal, other times it may be for the best that they never do
you're almost done the game if i'm not mistakne.
like doubling numbers
theres those junimo huts you can get
and try to get the kegs, theyre worth even more
theyre worth nothing on their own but so much when put into a fucking barrel
but i guess i should be "stupid" about these things as my parents say
it's not like the class is experimental
ill give you a hint, they wont be in a barrel
oh grad party will be safe
yeah but if a bunch of passwords leak from a site or something and you use the same one for everything, it doesnt matter how secure it is
it was funny to watch though
why do you think i have a place to copy and paste them all in from?
why are you upvoting
it's only once a year that you get to have a go with those hats

either that or you put one of your "or"s in the wrong place
also master yoru coding style is abysmal
but like
gummy uninstall
sorry drag am watching arrow season 1
borderline drunk
2,000 feet minimum.
windows 3.1
know what would be nice?
>_>;
so tonight i finally get to relax with empire
way less pollution
nah that cant be it
it's "only" flirting with 3 here
i copied and pasted from the semi-working version on github
wait until battery technology improves ida
electric cars are the future
if i murder you tomorrow that'll be the future instead
we talked about the art of history
i can truly live in the 18th century now
yeah i know
and gummy's friend seems a little bit degrading, is there anything else that you'd rather have us call you?
also met a new friend at the party
@gummy's friend: chuck his phone in the lake
i want some more twisted ice tea
get one for everyone here too
that was exciting
obviously
$1.26 a liter
he said ‘thanks i really appreciate that’
perfect
oh thats benny's
gummy says ‘get out of my face i feel really insulted’
she calls me a lot of things as well <:raritywink:278584590300348416>
<:gwupugurithinking:390299785841606656>
i hope youre charging them rent
i forgot my wallet and came home
smart bois
is it all private?
go for it
yall can laugh but i legit had a job in a lab one summer that involved an instrument called a "penetration penetroometer"
is it a tool that penetrates and measures penetration?
i spent more time trying to decide what book to read
you need to plug them into the coaxial outlet with the xlr switch enabled
blugh people are annoying
so that way when you pass a potatosalad instance to a metabolish instance it knows it can extract that information
bella's going to yell at us again for talking about code isnt she
public class potatosalad implements nutrition```
there's at least two in my colossal cave adventure knockoff that i sent you a few days ago
it's treason
it’s legit
god i ate so much cheese today...yesterday
hi gummy ^w^
you cant snort a condom
im just tired and wanting to play empire total war
oh yeah gummy
but im bad at that

ouo!
<:lul:305559915714576385>
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>
well they still dont make sense
that sounds a lot easier
all im doing is pushing myself
i'll brb
though if i could i would
same
we know
melia+mythra>all
now i want a drink
what the skitty it's full of dog treats
i need help
~~or you could just be yourself~~
a game?
no a server
she’s super cute
ok next is the trumpet blaring from the sky
time to play singleplayer games and not save
skyrim no save run
yeah
holy shit
holy crap its almost six pm and nobodys done anything for dinner bye
that was fun
actually code that
?0.0225"?m  
e gadd?
barf green with chunks.
night
it is
i guess you aren’t hungry
what?
good luck with that
i like to take credit for that
none of them are done well, however
so i have confidence that i'll qualify for the course
<:lul:305559915714576385>

gummy remind benny that im rooting for him
in javascript and game maker anyway
thanks you broke both my hands
ouo!
in java decidedly not
the following year students were not permitted to change the wallpaper
well it isn't
normally zero
mfw i can take math126 and math127 both over the summer 😮
in practice: there's like a hundred fifty lines we'd have to do that to and neither of us has the patience for that
no probably going to copy paste chant du départ and change some words
whenever my (great?)grandparents were high schoolers
now you can use them for food preparation
currently counting 435 photos
that sounds like the villain from splatoon 3
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
that won't end well
you people arent very good at this
1930s?
they don't curse in this movie but they changed words up
i have a growing amount of dislike for these types of videos. if you're not into a game yourself that's fantastic, no need to ruin it for other people.
(－‸ლ)
but yeah sing that song
fuck i’ll fix it on pc
and awesome holidays
<#305548986155008000> plz
<:gwcfcthonk:357907199928041473>
no bad apple
and also it makes me a better singer
im perfectly happy on my own
so i think the year my mom hit 18 they upped it
also i needed the territory of egypt which was own by the ottoman empire at that time so instead of declaring war and taking it, i did it the ida way
i guess that makes sense
your youth or your life as payment
i should sleep
sneak 100
no squid
squid you can be the guru of the gutter
could be
lol true
rip lol
greetings, will.

youre probably the only one who has
one was fine, the other was boring
i remember one time we played guitar hero in math class
but now i'm a higher enough rank than her that we can no longer play competitive together
i will smite thee

i only explored like 30% of guar plains
10/10 would make that mistake again
        });```
that's probably because shadowplay doesn't record at like a terabit per second
i use 1080p60 for mine too but use shadowplay. stuffs a lot smaller
what does bitrate even change
ive only edited like fifteen or sixteen btw
oh like taco style of bowl?
your spleen hole is bleeding so much you must know something

i hate algebra <:rooderp:399827526744014848>
because it bothers you
nice
but i could
yes rainy?
get sarah to beat him then
were you just gonna uber everywhere? <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
why not
thanks
gas is expensive btw
also hot coffee on a winter morning is the only reason i'm not 100% atheist
thank you!

why not
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>

good times
how was it a good idea?
<:gwnanamilaceshrug:403295147892277249>
well a lot of stuff happened a while back which caused me to have to retake a bunch of classes
listen to war music
...yeah started drinking at grad party and now all i can think about it trying everything that’s alcoholic
i don’t wanna be napoléon anymore tbh i only wanna be him when i play my war games
feels like i never talk to you guys anymore
man, i had some crazy pizza dreams last night, tripped the heck out
gummy stop making me stay up
now i kick my pants off discord
i know how to by passed the system
back to war
how do you not eat bacon
from my point of view what about the wookies?
i mean let's be real, xc1's menus are awesome considering the stupid amount of things that they do
oh i found it
no you dont lose your skyrim license, just your bard college position
if you find out let me know too i was wondering that
i have no idea how they got that
oh there once was a hero named ragnr the red
i just took the final, my grade isn't 89% it's actually 94% so soon i'll be the only one with a grade in the 90s lol
so i was actually going to do something productive but napoleon total war is calling me
i pretty much just guess since 3/4 were correct
history is better
but napoleon total war
also a shrine
“do you know the definition of insanity?” vaas
ask ida on that one
strengthen the empire, weaken the thalmor
dammit, i wanted that
i just hate stupidity, in both myself and others
how about chant du départ
modern rap is like saying classical music
i hate everyone myself but i have a reason
then why side with him if you're gonna betray him anyways?
they make such satisfying noises when they die
and it gives you a source of dispensable npcs
that's hakon you fool
they cause me to be stressed the fuck out
and just took the forsworn with it
welp a 15 minute talk about math with my dad turned into an hour and a half debate about god
bad news, they want to kill me now
it's just my phobias make the game hell for me
oh hey gummy, hows the windchime?
good
i say nay
who chooses that side
i just don’t care about action movies. except maybe deadpool
hey that’s ben’s money
a tnt a day keeps the doctor away

i knew something was up
```that item does not exist. it may have been removed by the author.```

indian/russian whatever the fuck it was

youtube has done it again...
it's okay youre not supposed to be able to remember elven names anyway
friends decides to troll in server
head of the institute
used that 4 cheese-blend
don't sully that name by bringing it up here
what’s pride and predjudice?
the plane game was nice
and hey, i needed bones for my glove, might as well do it in the dungeon
nice
since everyone has a different role and in the same category
brb looking for cheese
how about napoleon total war?
i beat you in that
with a sawzall and a blowtorch
this is pointless
you suffer from a condition called not nerdy enough
it is always the time for java jokes
i dont remember that but that thought got a chuckle out of me
nothing happens
you called it
the russian empire sucked after tsar alexander i died
yeah far
nothing?
that's a surprising thing to hear from you
good job skarm
also was asleep 2.5 hours before you sent that
because
ever
\`\`\`do this\`\`\`

spongebob is better now

i think rc needs to hang out with gummy more
i couldnt stand ash back in like season 1, where have you been
and once i find my mic i'll get on for what will probably only last until i either a) go meetup with friends to binge a bunch of shows or b) we decide to play the vidya games
32 seasons i believe
now i want cheese
what foobar thing?
shush panda it's more fun to blame me
who was the asshat who called it foobar?
it's more or less a religion thats one of those stereotypical ones i guess
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
> dragonite
no i don’t
it's deja vu all over again
inebriated
/m,e hugs
fkubs
just saw deadpool 2
i call the english language the language of anguish
im seeing ads for barbecue and getting extremely hungry
if it's written out you can decipher, at this point with speaking i don't think you could understand if they used spelling or grammar correcty
flubs can you give me 10 examples of ideas that aren't a theory
if you can make a sentence where the subject is not a noun, i will go drive off a cliff and forward the insurance check to you
that makes no sense
flubs
sooooo
i should probably talk here more
what separates an idea from a thing?
why does it feel like he never streams anymore
lol, day off, if only
have fun with that
~~yourself?~~
its monday
ida!
flubs you gotta watch this amazing show that i am currently watching
well then back to yelling at people for pinging other people
~~i think skyrim is going to be on your phones now~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
power rangers
god damn it how am i still in the lead?
camelot 2.0 is falling apart because i hesitate on decisions
cause have you ever heard of missile thrusters?
what?
very carefully. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
can you ask her to let me finish my finals first
like linear algebra, number theory, topology, etc
then i can get into differential equations
does dragonite not like bluej
if i put the same effort into my other classes like i did math i'd be amazing at everything in school, lol
differential equations fascinate me, i wanna learn about those eventually
my university offers a multitude of stuff though
my ap history course for next year just assigned their summer project
not the best, but also not terrible
im just excited to read napoleon in america
it was invented when a supercomputer was injected with 12 tons of meth, 3 tons of weed, and a pool-worth of lsd
yup looks like it
im pretty excited just to dive into calculus
okay, now that i think about it, lets go is gen 1
because gum doesn’t ban
what have they done?
so i just decided to make a text adventure rpg and implement sound
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
but you guys never talk when im here
well shoot, ok
if we’re taxing people now...
nice
i throw things that we don’t need out of the ~~hole in the wall~~ window
nah i don't have a gba anymore

no idea.
c—a—n—a—d—a
because i have no idea how to make an algorithm that will do this
eyan is starting the sequel to jersery shore
forgot about that one
been a little while since auto pin kicked in
did you even hear a word i said
oh wait do you mean one that i actually use?
meh i hate how all my plans have changed
i think this is the 3/4 time
have fun with the penguins, flubs
when i wake up in the morning, i instinctively look on discord and youtube.
i was going to say flubs' current missiles are probably more explodey but i guess not
i did once
exploding footballs break?
brb food
how bout, no
is the sea always salty because the land never waves back?
no pink

time for new friends yes
but didn't you already graduate
cool...if only the military was like what it was once wa
it was literally the same stuff you had already learned
racist
boy were they wrong
i must say, it is rather amusing to be looking for an enemy that turned invisible and then finally when they turn visible again they're having a seizure on the floor due to the paralysis thing
work
and you arent even told what is incorrect,just that it is "incorrect"
oh yeah, it's officially gay month

i honestly don’t like muk
for me
because those are funny
i probably shouldn't get too far into it but to give you an idea there was one hitler fan a few months back
i thought it was that some assholes got lazy and just sent the fucker to the future

hey drago
darn asshole can’t vc with me while i film
or youre missing the button
im gonna stop doing that one day
how convenient
help i forgot to switch onto my non-speedrunning version of the game

we lost to the toilet of the major leagues
and its so good to kill in it
psst, i know you who are. hail sithis
this time i said something along the lines that she would get fired less than a day
and im quite sure that the failing grade was a 65
i wonder what dragonite's dietary councellor tells him during their meetings
woah
damn thats pretty...okay

i have to smash it against my desk until it comes apart by divine intervention
rip i can't change my server nick to "dragonite - guru of life and laziness"

the blue jays are winning but it's against the orioles so it doesnt count
idk how to read baseball scores
no no
bottom one master
i know
well too bad
i meant the commies
brb now food

the russian army mostly had peasants as troops, they only had 200,000 regulars
actually eh
<:doit:334014889137930240>
you can't tell the future? what are you? a level 17????
i’m killing rabbits in minecraft pe version
fast food
(just testing stuff)
wont this just slam my face into the ground
who said we were driving?
she was still following me in boolean but was stuck on the platform for like 80 load screens
wont this just launch me upwards and then into a spin where i then slam my face into the ground
thank
it was in the baconator that you ate, majestic
squid you're slacking on your job, you're supposed to give out baconators to people
i just got back onto discord
again
my picture was flipped, but i changed it to something else a couple months ago. and now back to this because i didn't have the original saved
and then questioning why he's doing any of that work
jokes on you i'm on summer break
anyways where was i?
i think sumo was kind of a last straw for him
he blew up back then because of an algorithm change.
with the whole "the only people here"
beep
and a gf thats helping with the depression but makes the youtube comeback take a bit longer
!leaderboard
dont even attempt pink. it will destroy you
okay thats it brb
stop making me feel old .-.
unfortunately yes
most of us do
good job master
gummy stop getting deatroyed
*throws a blanket over flubs head* shut up
socks are hard ok
but i already said that about the 5 emotes
dont get dragonite started on faces
(◕ ε ◕)
blah blah blah /rant
"we need to talk,i want to despise other people"
woah now no need to cuss
since i essentially finished it today lol
honestly, the only game that i’m looking forward to out of what microsoft showed was fallout 76. but i’m just waiting for bethesda to give more information on it
aqua
whats the difference between gum and marshmello?
i feel like theyre gonna pull something
like last year’s nintendo e3 presentation when pokemon for the switch was announced
bethesda isn't dumb, they know announcing something like 76 so close to 4 with no tes would stir some shit
also, i got the kh1 platinum trophy the other day
because porting skyrim to the pip boy was just too hard
in other words, i'll buy it when it's cheap and hackers figure out how to hand out money
i don’t see you declaring war on countries for no reason and looting cities
the fuck you mean 3 am?
animal man is gummy’s son? <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
didnt reply to me in modlog either...
misc. stuff
drago
hello there
so i have a bunch of tears that when i fire them stay in place until i release fire, and then shoot off as vortexes of death lasers and hell magma that explode
we’re a small group
not my fault apparently the pope hates me so i’ll just take napoleon to rome and loot it
its a very fun game
master you officially have too much time on your hands
and really shitty
well i mean you dont have a youtube chanel
beef?
you can play wow by yourself too
for the people that could survive in guantanamo bay
i'm from the days when online gaming was in its infancy
rc you suck
ah. meant to type that into a different server. sorry.
guys
but i need my analytics
or youll be alive, if you call that living
i just love this movie
gummy, i will beat any toxic narcissism out of you so help me god
want to do it to him?
sleep now or something bye
on switch
happy birthday, bella.
now time to plan out something really stupid that im going to do
the stream chat is going nuts right now.
you travel to sovengarde to kill alduin and eat cheese
i'm not crying
not in that order
i'm a daisy main for life
smash is fun but i can only play kirby
but still i'm hyped!
and i'm going to stick with mario kart. and maybe mario party when it comes out
you'd think it would be that easy but apparently this little to-do has been raging for like a half hour now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
or try to hit from far away
also i'm pretty sure pokémon is the reason why they're waiting till december to release smash
did nintendo actually say anything about pokémon? because twitter is strangely devoid of pokémon
im confused
also did i say 47? i meant 147, i missed a digit
no part
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
honestly it's probably not work reading too much into it
math126 (pre-calculus i) midterm
i get that its an engineering course so it has to use the imperial system but i dont think the imperial system ever gave grades on a scale of 0-9
of course ive only seen like 4
i don't think it was bad.
one thing i hate: es6 overshadowing the rest of the conference
cake or ice cream?
its been free
it just was pointless at the same time
i can understand why people might see it as more of a port than a brand new game
also i didnt play videogames in 2010 or whenever it came out
i still have my wii u as a paperweight
yeah i mean no need to bash their fun
i know but being excited for a game they like and not being excited for a game they dont like doesnt really make them hypocrites
what about double dash?
for not being faithful to the original
ct is the only major jrpg i've played through
my brother in law got me chrono trigger
nope
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
86 years old
e3 was fuckin boring
so, not only did nintendo have their splatoon and smash bros tournaments today, but apparently fortnite has something going on. ~~we can clearly tell what everyone would want~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
good job 🎉
and this was just from me reading a fan site; i never heard him say anything from himself
speaking of which 18 in one week

hes the real general reposti
you should get it, it's really fun but insanely addicting
well its also a species but thats unrelated
the portuguese man they killed 1:6 of my army

pretending to not want to die is a full time job
tends to be how people eat yeah
hehe

i'm just more active so i can attain red galoer and be haopy

i've never even heard your voice which is pdd

or did i just miss it
it's only in place for lesser evolved species
yay rc too

<:rarityflirt:447907828187922452>
welp didn’t win anything from the scratch ome
it uses location so it would for you
at my place of work, you will see people spend so much money on those and usually not make that amount back
hey gummy remember the time you found a way around the at-everyone ban?
don't be an undesirable person
am i undesirable?
from what though?
rounding is hard
guess i better take benny out again
i think he was the head of admin of the forums actually
i had a good bday though besides not winning anything on my scratch ticket
hello there
i didn't do anything
just gotta figure out drago’s bday and troll him im twitter that day
twitter
its fine as long as you keep your socks on
but it’s good

i never took the ap exam in the one ap class i took; i just paid for the credits
very bad
i sold my console for pc parts
hmmm
you terrify them
i'm a bunny rabbi

watch an episode or something
or you can be like me and haven’t played anything on steam since i uninstalled it years ago <:kappa:374346980136058893>
you could have done something like this
18 in alberta, manitoba, and quebec
england
history's for nerds
i didn’t get “drunk” but i definitely woke feeling super tired
because i cant go there so its dumb
is london the one in france or england
oh she’s been hitting on me the day she ask me out in grade 10
i wanted to go to antarctica
ok, how many times have i died now?
florida is good in the sense that "it's not new jersey"
you know im not going to let you compliment new jersey to that degree
your state sucks drago
oh so you went to the not populated places
why flubs?
lets go to canada flubs
or whatever the fuckin quote is
i just don’t like the large jump in levels
that's what they all say
wait
all i had to do was show up to school
(－‸ლ)
any cooked pasta is good
so if the sun were to explode that would be a literal disaster
random stuff
i hate friendship
its just math slang
why not just play the one thats on windows 7
like honestly there are better ones than ours
and thats on the complex plane?
what would the baby look like though
i knew flubs was addicted to cocaine
the seasons are crazy there
well misty tells me i have a gambling problem
i had enough teenage drama irl, why do i need more of it on television
then its not a virus now
maybe should have gotten yelled at but whatever
static shock and the zeta project
okay what about west virginia
im watching it right now
and no teen titans is not in the dcau
theres no second place in running. theres first and theres last.
it takes a lot to be a good runner and if youre winning you can be an ass
gift me what also you cant
wait is the flash dc
help i cant stop eating ice cream
just a general hatred for life, y'know, the usual
i will gift you
theres a problem there
you counter it with alcohol, the higher the proof the better
yeah that can't be fixed
its a collection of sabers from fallen jedi
thats your new anthem?

oh you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead, now i think its high time that you lie down and bleed

insane?
also i only live like 45 minutes away from the us
wait whats happening now?
no i hate it
why doesnt it give a preview
this ones ok
im on the floor, gummy is now pissy, red is failing, and there are too many fuckin canadians
it's not like it's cold all year long xd
i was surprisingly popular in high school
i'm inside flubs' head
also imma focus on getting up so no talk for flubs
no wolve
want me to re-route it to algetty?
it has been requested that we route this conversation over to <#311411150611021824>
and by that dragonite means we've had that pokémon gen wars talk like 20+ times already and people are sick of it
there can be two moms, jesus christ it's 2018
zeus got it on with a lot of women didnt he?
i can ignore the sounds and listen to the words

thats why my picture is luigi dabbing
last time i used a credit card on steam and other places
i bought it to give the creator money
he deserved it
the old man from pawn stars has died
signed in on a school computer now, let's see how long i can do this before the teacher notices
rollercoaster tycoon 2
is there a final exam for speech?
idk but ive had interesting luck with that so far in this school
yeah he was like one of the only authors i read wililngly since harry potter ended
hmmm
legs are good for things even if you cant use them
it's about as complicated of a definition as the average program that dragonite writes
why must it be really active when i’m busy?
flubs is your dog superman
sorry gummy is just rubbing off on me
*throws math out the window* i don’t need this right now
nicholas the second was a dumb ass
powdered mini donuts are so good, let me tell you
they're good
oh boi, sneaky back at it again with another cosplay
oh, and stephen is going to meet mal in canada for something
well i've got some years to go
she is awesome
much curlier, and benny has brown on his ears
hai majestic
im just hoping my group members got 100% too
assassins are a dime a dozen, i'd just do it myself
cant record replays tho
i just found out we’re on the 15th anniversary of the room coming out
oh boy
man there was nothing like wii baseball
we want mario 64
im the dumbest person i know flubs
im at the part where we know shes gonna get dead but she probably isnt gonna get dead because plot
same
because time paradox
who were the contenders
or barry as a character, idk which. either way hes a dick
and future
my report cards don't do that i think, mine would register as a 101 or whatever
aight cool so explain how season 3 ends
who’s sara?
im like halfway thru s1
nah, kara and sara are both my two least favorites
and nothing but
have yet to go to the ben and jerrys place near me in a while tho
i said pasta
couldn't get into it, don't know why
yeah because they suck
flubs was talking about a show
i figured out why she didnt eat this one
almost one year anniversary of something every big
the day we decided to flip off some dude over the big water
but only because
i guess you have been though. bad gummy.
july 12 is when i first met you and bunni
but like why do they need to do it that way
you join the skype chat around july 18-19 of 2016
and those sandtraps always get in my way
hiya
just finished high school
i dont play it nearly as much as i used to but it's probably still my favorite franchise overall
actually my road trip might not be that bad because i get to see my pokémon-playing cousin . . .
thats where youre wrong
i resent that statement
july 12th will be one year of me meeting flubs and bunni
you already have all you want from previous events as well
oh yeah thats true bella. we can just get him fired and still get paid.
i'll give you 10% of my check
do we though?
if you feel like traveling halfway across the country or something
but that's just a part of life
you wouldnt have to dread going to work there ever again
solving in general is my cup of tea
brb starting a pyramid scheme
he’s 8 pounds
i lose and lose
actually it's personal so i can't talk about it
awesome
the exam looks like fun
hee hee, gummy said "butt"
divert 1% of bird game to d.js
now that i think about it i can probably extend the hello there interactions a bit more
that butter replacement is better squid
i wonder how many of those are in there
```i like all boobs! all boobs are good boobs```
it’s rotten because of stupid events that happened
```_pokes ida with a stick_```
vista
it just amazes me what people come up with
speedruns especially interest me
the french wanted the brits to shoot first
that seems more like letting your rival pick a pokemon first
whoops
the french were cowards after napoleon’s empire collapsed
it is, and i'm winning
yes he missed
so we are basically brits
hey man just because you cant get hired doesnt mean you cant make money
then the english did
im sharing memes with friends
of course
i apologize for my rant there, i just thought i should express myself
foooooooooooooooood
now it's a civil war
but if hes animal and man but man is animal is he animalanimal or manman
i am the senate
drago you are in charge of it now
manman sounds like a good superhero
good
shut up i like my version more
idk, try poking him or something
oh i see
_looks at bella_
who said i was making steaks?
such is the way of htings
no worse
and yes
also my video editing job got delay
wanna hang tonight?
yeah *replaces airbag with potato bomb*
im not eating that
i eat like a soldier
4000 pieces just means it'll last longer
good job
....
thought you had it on the floor
they might've changed a few things since than.
nyet
do you not know what a stoner means?
i remember something else i used to eat was a vegan product, but they changed some ingredients and well it ain't anymore
whats the old folks home
<:keepo:327304799919800321>
half of conversations are fun
i like music
do not sleep at me
and its almost been a year since the best day of your life
drago gummy called you crazy
well camelot 2,0
3+ hours in now
my bacon for baconators...
but it really isnt that bad
or a glock
no no kill the old people. old people hold jobs and say mean things so just remove them from the equation
chautauqua
traditional news outlets think anything that’s animated is for children 😒
and blamed it for making a kid commit suicide
is fortnite turning our children into satan loving cannibals? more at eight
i mean itll happen to all video games that get popular eventually, it's just a matter of when
i had just a minor defensive reaction to it
but he hugged me
<:ironic:307345212328509442>
you know what
even when you don’t like someone you shouldn’t say it out loud
welp
but you wouldn't last
of course
send me in
boom
well i assume some of the ones i talked to are there
still didnt answer my question
did alienware glue those in or some shit?
nice
wait
master
the case i have rn i got for free from brad
there is still a new motherboard and power supply
upgrade
that wont cost you more than a mortgage
ram is good for me as well
ddr3 pc3-12800 non-ecc (1600 mhz)
im going to end up blowing something up
animal man you should really get that autocorrect checked out
not really
i just saw that
thats 3 not 2
did something go?
two front usbs won’t work since there isn’t enough power ever since the hard drive upgrade
the thing with e!commands is that nobody uses them after the first few.days
except for like the crash one (me)
case upgrade which requires new power supply and a new motherboard
anyway im going to be in an automobile for three more hours. master know any good shanties?
if it says am3 or am3+ it wont work with intel
all i want is a new case, power supply, and motherboard
my sanity
why do you guys carry laptops with you for class?
you want side window?
cpu model?
except for the time i recorded b roll for something while waiting for the professor
dont burn the server down while im gone
and what i got seemed like a devil spawn
my major is video production
what formular?
now, back to fallout
good to know
mmkay
i even check the max rotation and it was set to 360
i wonder if they actually expect anyone to watch it
youre in degrees or rads?
mom wasn’t supposed to go with dad and sister to the city but i guess they did
is it valuable stuff?
but i had no clue it was called super tower
spring and fall have allergies though
then eat
spring and fall have allergies though
wait, what?
and you were right
no just 55 million and what i would buy
well this is the other super tower on this site
thanks, i mean i think i can reach it since video premieres count as streaming
holy fuck
seriously
hey guys want to know the dumbest thing i ever did?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
now gummy
la familia went to italy a few years ago
does he actually have the following to warrant fighting back?
of course you have to be sarcastic...
and now i believe someone’s dog is barking at them
. . . there is no possible interpretation of this where it doesn't sound awful
fireworks are ez even though i've never tried them
that gummy is crazy?
didn’t see that much yesterday
ヽ(°▽ °)ノ
as opposed to the usual 99%?
i meant the former best friends list
blitz as on of those amazing deep voices
drago sounds like a robot
then again for some odd reason i went from hating rc to actually liking him
why would i switch spots with you? and what are we switching spots with?
no gummy
how come i still do?
what is life's greatest illusion
the old sg one that didnt make me stay in compact mode?
but sister is probably going to want to play fallout and that requires the same screen and i'm too lazy to commandeer another television
it was enterntaining
whats the most savage way you can destroy their entire faith in their faith?
or how long was the day before god made the sun
yay single buddies
oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil, and majoram
of teeny tiny pizza
oh please i've done and said worse, now i wanna hear it
now that youre full start bombrding them with questions about inconsistencies in the bible
oh i called one of the mods in a server "favourite little mod"
she wouldn’t hurt me
im done fooling around, if master wants the bot's game to be something useful i'll let it be something useful
also marksmen aren't bot laners anymore
there's no max level anymore
you aren't even on the list
(◡‿◡✿)
got th modding yet?
can't believe wob found a loop hole through rule 8
lmfao when lee sin doesn't get a single kill or assist until 20 minutes into the game
skyrim 620+
i am the most crazy
<:treason:396483914803445761>
im actually psychopath level according to both online and irl people who know me well
luckyskarm
i wanna get the duck blown up by the ship
that's actually the name of a youtube channel.
“some people live a simple life, while others have a fire that threatens to engulf the world”
*throws the sentence out the window* i suggest you start over
i mean im doing it im third person
ooo another pokemon argument
i want the roleplay
“i do not know when the fire in gummy first burn, perhaps he always had a destiny...”
enemies (drago) and peoplei despised (drago)
teaching the bot to sing is the best thing i ever did
and guess what you aren’t in it!
the pokemon tournament
even though they weren't even in that server to begin with
i got a sword
i meant acorn gun
why is the rum always gone
xenobald
imma break something
i want rum right now as well
whatever you say fantom
right gummy
perhaps he always had a destiny, but sometimes destiny can use a little help..or even an argument"
panda and squid sound similar...
but i need something more powerful
the irony of that.
thats what i have so fay
what i should be doing: taking the dog for a walk
how have you not gone insane yet?
gummy the south pole is not the equator
i am angry
｡･ﾟ･◝( ◕ ヮ ◕)◜･ﾟ･｡
:ya da:
there
goddamn emote isn’t working
for some reason, “ta” kept getting autocorrected to “ya”
would have taken me days at home
reroll that dream
i dreamt i got promoted to mod on pony server for one week but i had to change my name from supergummying, rarity gif expert to supergummying, wailord master
you rang
im supposed to be a wailord master
wait
im going to get a sylveon gif maybe
is that <:treason:396483914803445761> i see
subway
i was sleeping
im refering to the server theme nto the usual topic
im not sure if that's how it works
and looking at the randomness of your nickname history
there goes the perfect game
six perfect for tampa bay
you need more
fineee i;ll ask ida
he’s my new best friend
bunny would probably just chew on the cards
who else do i fight?
....
thats why i asked you about the writing to a file in java
okay rainy
big brother feature
whee
what smirk?
where is luckyskarm?
well i could always drag ida in the roleplay
you always agree with me
it’s usually ida that drags me around
it’s fun <:keepo:327304799919800321>
why do you think i leave this place all the time?
how are we boring?
and go on from there
you gotta say ridiculous things everyday to catch people’s attention
but i want to know how fallout ends
intel® core™ i9 7980xe (18-core, 24.75mb cache, up to 4.4ghz with intel® turbo boost max 3.0)
traps are so so gay
well
editing an advertising video for him
case should come tomorrow or wednesday
thats a horrible idea
i don’t wanna video edit
my stuff came
cause its unrealistic for some like dragonite or animal man where those might be used in a different context
okay the bot can mention people but i've trained it to not in most circumstances
im not complaining
he is using fimora
don't look at me it's not my fault we're out of phoenix down
but um
dead yes
and there was one more?
we're all friends with a guy who has 270k but that doesn't make us popular now does it
ever since he collab and made friends with people
drago's forum friends got the boot
1327 for me
that’s pretty much it
i think i know a place
do we call him dragobro?
i'd rather end up as mortal enemies
oh hes offline
i tried that too
so it is
burn your phone
the serailzable shit?

i just got baned
oh dear
so is renpy
30 mins later
it's okay, life's a joke
hmmm
i embrace the magic
nobody does
never heard of him
you are no fun
sounds like a weird guy
he’s a great guy
so, i never fixed that bicycle tire because dad has the hand pump that i need to refill the inner tube. so i had to walk 2.5 mi home in the 95 degree heat in a black shirt because i'm smart and have lots of fore sight.
also still not going to be active here for god knows how long so thats fun or something
someone explain to my sister what a raspberry pi is
i'll fix it some other day. for now, code.
why's that?
i'm only in one server that has a nsfw channel
same
/r/history
complicated bullshit
what server?
idk it’s a reddit discord, reddit is weird
and gummy, have you considered gitting good?
she's a princess who wants to be left alone or doted upon and loved intensely, no in-between
you can guess which one this is
*takes cat and runs* i want a cat
i have my own bad counter this time around
i need to get in my pc again
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
have you injested enough of your namesake
that’s what i am gonna do today
update: patch broke when i put the tire back on the wheel. fingers too sore to try a third time. skipping bike ride today.
perfectly balanced
k both hard drives are good
reading patch notes is for losers
a guy posted his setup in a server and i saw for the first time an extended super tower
the chimchar was my starter in one playthrough of platinum. i think it was during my trip to disney world in 2010
while others say i don’t
theres a lot of anime that i need to watch
that’s just a toaster
now to move the processor over
e!google server tower
i never read the rules
well maybe you should have considered that before doing something that you knew was going to result in me seeing them on fire
they're good for your health
pretty
like this
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
youtube recommends dogs getting tased videos
yay for typing 3d modeling shortcuts into the discord chat window again
oh finnaly
what about those bean boozled ones?
basically meaning he/others don't care whether or not people see what he's reading based on cover art.
the only thing that pops into my head is why
the grape one
the ending part is what bothers me most ~_~
how are you this night
gummy you _are_ a robot
i said i thought it was wednesday in another server
dont be silly, i only do those when my brother is at school
glad to hear it
dont nom
be grateful.
so thats today's til
flubs is like dead
guys let's just face it, eyan streams when he has time
thats not your pc
windows products
maybe some cables
i mean technically you said it last tuesday, so....
other than that summer is brilliant
the royal navy is better than winter
what am i going off on
isn't gimp available on linux
gummy did you say "a terabyte" or "eight terabyte"
hang on
for the record i don't know what half of these do
that's something i never though i'd say until last year
you know what? that's like the third time in as many days that i've posted osmething to the wrong server
whats your point?
what is the gift of death?
because why not
i fell off the ether mine a good four or five times
this is fun
what is the music of life?
third time being banished
in this windy old weather
im an expert
stormy old weather
that’s embarrassing drago and you should feel bad
well
rainy here
i'm pretty sure that's the default
it grows exponentialy
thats why i am saying it out loud here
that's a rear wheel drive car on a dyno (a tool used to measure power output in a car)
wow apparently the league community turned into a bunch of damn snowflakes, i can't say anything in chat anymore without getting banned
pretty much.
asking for help or asking people to stop dying is apparently a bannable offense
every ten levels
its summer, who tf is giving you homework?
see thing
i am more insane than everyone here
a person just posted a pic of his pc and damn that liquid cooling looks amazing
well except skarm
i have the non rgb version of this mouse
i guess dragonite
and they did great though was hard through discord
but made with science
scrub
well you better send pics
get rainy to talk to you
thats how everything breaks
sadly
and why am i in charge of the vc? thats drago's job
i was thinking closer to 2%
except when eyan streams
does gummy carry a majority of voice calls here?
it was just interesting to look back
you just have something to always talk about
and they turn out like you
that should speak for itself
flubs is flubs but he can do my shit posting job
its easy
give me a dollar
lucky you
that isn’t pony base
dardoch is a bish
break time
i got attacked by a rabbit
like 1% of my deaths were caused by falling off the world though
and?
i just pm him 3 hours ago asking if he was dead or in jail
reboot first
im actually really surprised
whoa sneaky back on c9's stage team
then a bunch of them appeared
thinkingface
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
i mean uh
i assume you were in jail
you are in france
so im kinda like you now
don’t go to venice though
theres no way i havent mentioned that
bari
417 days or 14 months or 1.14 years or about the average time it takes for someone to climb out of bronze
well tbh it explains why benny comes to my house everyday
                if (spl.length>=2)
var spl=message.split(" ");
we figured it out
anyway i looked at the code and it should be okay, since it checks `message.tolowercase().includes(refstring which is already lower case)`
you are good
hai friends ^w^
we don't talk about that
i feel like this is the 5th time the fishing pole story has come up now
no bad
so you would have to import them on your end
~~we’re all just crazy~~
hey master i'm bored and it's too early to make food, tell me something to do with the bot
fuck yeah
and even though you sniped me in saying that i'm gonna type it anyway
i only cook bad food
good job benny (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
i vote option a.
i was trixie last week
i hate mobile keyboards
gummy, you really need to read a book on how to make good insults
i said often you troll
you also like rarity <:kappa:374346980136058893>
well, you’re no help
i tell her that on a daily basis
it hasn't kernel panicked yet anyway
r.i.p. grozard “swormswood” and eletux “elle-ectro”
do `e!setref demon` or whatever you pref
i am
noooo i just lost two pokémon in a nuzlocke
this is so sad alexa play wonderwall
then they travel around looking for that spell she needs
im having heat stroke again
that translate to 
whats up squid hows life
drago be a sheep next
alright, same
howdy fellow frands
dumb and dumber 2
when was this?
nope i was gone
hilarious
really?
turns out no....
but tbh it kinda makes sense
that sounds amazing, bella.
the one you gotta watch out for is gummy, aka rarity, or whatever he's calling himself right now
i was pretty young
apprantly so.
they supported the snes for quite a long time actually
i come back for one moment and i'm greeted like this? shame on you.
no this is more like a basic tourney with friends
it usually ends in a surrender or a treaty i think
i’ll take his apology as a surrender
i wake up to the ex apologizing to me
~~git gud~~
im the dovahclean
welcome to the world of airplanes
whenever my dad runs out of storage space on his phone his solution is to say "put it on a flash drive" and then never do jack shit about it
how much do hotels cost
i thought it was a rabbit
that obviously hasnt stopped spongebob
or lewdness
9000 was the peak
gonna get led out by security at magfest
in some places
but i hate anime
because it will cost $2000
and it only really gives you the bonus ad for the brief time frame when you're in combat.
video games
over your dead body
~~maybe i just felt like sharing them~~
im with c9 even though they did stupid things at the start of the spilt
never book a flight for next day
oh that reminds me
this time i will win
if so try warframe next
you make it sound like skyrim
yes, like the thing you're losing to a two-inch rodent
well shit
nice nice
the whole relationship issue is saved
i could make a fabulous girl
im still single, and this is the first time in my life where i'm legit kinda sad about it so there's that
play total war
i won the wat
i proposed to her yesterday but realize you were suppose to do that way later
but i found someone even though she is the same one that tried to force me to be trans
i proposed to her yesterday
wanna trade?
im betraying my own book
i've never traveled by plane and i hope to never really need to, or travel in general
it's not hard
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
also star wars is ending in 2019
it says the last movie will be 2019
wanna see what will happen to the darth vader mini dude

and took power for himself
because it sucks
he betrayed the ugly dude
i need to get back on a normal person sleep schedule for when school restarts, anyway
i was inform by my mom
fuck
@ rainy
then i will borrow it
that movie was made in the 70s the rabbit has probably been dead for decades
i prefer jupiter bound
that’s a guy who needs a haircut
it is not overkill
you told me benny eats everything
alright
bella
you are my wingman
flubs does not have wings
you can slap gummy with it
well at least we know its an int
flubs only has left hands
didnt you two break up?
thinkingface
and threaten to unleash 50 people on the ex
i challenged him to a duel
people are gonna be idiots online
i can answer that one for him
i fight dirty
there are many ways to check a problem
i know
whats your username
i did this same exact way i did another similar problem but im getting results that dont make sense
it is
is it 40 feet horizontally or parallel to the slope?
my calc was in bloody radian mode
good thing drago isn’t a friend
697.0 then
nah not demeaning enough
guess who almost typed their brokerage account id and password into discord again
that sounds like a once-ever-five-year event
cats decided to make me play contortionist in bed for 2 hours
it took me twice as long as building the shape to add the letters
come back
gotta love having a monopoly on mideival bitcoin
i tried to scare them
yeah thats what i thought when it ran on hotel wifi
why is gummy a fridge?
welcome

you hook the rods onto the enemy or boss and it deals damage every period of time as determined by the weapon.
i've gotten top of my team for the past 6 games, all of which were losses
as in pre 1.0.
like i said
i think they just dont care about the feature actually existing on a free version so they dont bother bug fixing for it
did you pet the cat
so im traumatized since i took my friend to the movies and i let her text my gf for some girl talk
you rang
i sleep at 2
alright
nvm you aren’t old enough to drink
probably wont be finished with my work and workout in like 3 hours but thanks haha
spoiler alert
0/10 connection skills discord
they will
messages not sending
gummy this just cramming
last night was on the complex plane and demovire's theorems and today is about vectors and ellipses
~~in english?~~
did i hear history
well thats fine, you might bump into someone better
exactly
btw side tangent i saw someone wrongly say "i believe in you" and said "i believe at you" and i refuse to say the correct way
they could actually turn out to be someone you might not like so it’s a safer option
relationships are always hard if youre not 100% ready to be in a relationship, or not sure how to approach it
i don't like work
well
what. is free on youtube. they're both on netflix
stop being picky
what the fuck
alright heres an easy one
until you realize you were being an idiot
ooh we talkin bout exams

i don’t even watch baseball at all <:keepo:327304799919800321>
hey gummy what's your mouse up to
there was a 2017 gummy?
im shoving off for the night don't etc. the place down bye
its not doing enough for me
what
ohhh ideepoo we still need to play civ one day
also, my opinion on video editing is that, why learn video editing when you can put the time into learning something like photoshop
maybe
ahh yes, frame-by-frame editing
my favourite mod wanted us to be a trio
do you think ida would be happy to know that i started getting into the fate(?) series? 🤔
imma dinosaur
this was the girl i told you about that force her old bf to be transgender and me
it's like drago 1500 and gummy 8
i know that i am aware of everything that i am aware to know about it
imma slap ya
so you will never marry sarah?
go to eyan's wedding
drago my heart is not for you
a long term relationship is emotionally and mentally taxing as hell
shes pretty much an objectively bad person but thats ok
you aren't taking my throne
im at the nicest ive ever been in my life
<:gwdogawoophotoblob:402874215759609867>
acceptance
i was suppose to love him
someone eli5 what the point of league is
remember
um you can't do anything though
that is um that is me
idk what you are talking about
i can't picture serious gummy for some reason
bella dont encourage him
hmmm well i am tired master
good idea
also i am breaking wedding traditions
i dont remember their names describe them
which will be ida
when you get back
never met him
what do you mean
ill tell you a quick one now
i like your great grandpa already
or something

oh dear
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

flubs youll be dead before we extract gas let alone have permanent settlements on another plane
```
for once you dont take the stupid side
phones didnt exist back then
they did but they were affixed to the walls
traitor
something you did to me
thats like half of a train's interior for one section of the thing
let it happen
gummy, plug yourself in. you’re ruining the orange juice
man i love super mario world
okay let the birds eat it
flubs arent you in italy time why are you awake
here is my theme
needsmorejpg
hello rc, you’ll really like phantomrc
fiiiiiiiiiine
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
you moved on from super cases when you found out they were real
i still have yet to be pinned
<:thinkingsteps:396534879833292810> 
i feel like gummy rates games based on whether or not it has muskets in it...
there are other planets
all the one piece games suck
opposite of whitesleep
they even put that in sun and moon
yes rc.
yeah i was thinking of that one too lol
and then it kicked me out
“hi people, i’m superfridge”
i am gonna clean it
i really want this pirate game
that's the stupidest thing i've heard since... nevermind
3 in a half years ago
i found chocolate chunks in my keyboard
i found dust
thanks
and food crumbs in it
im nervous about this podcast
skyrim is overrated
shit now i want pizza
want some chocolate chunks?
ask negative gen 6 questions
so water won’t wotk
i’m back from work ya ninnies
"water wont work because its *somewhat* water *resistant*"
drago
why would i be a home
gummy it's too early in the morning for this nonsense
and bad news
see my stomach is not my weakness
good news i get to meet her irl sooner than expected
or go
i got a new mission
and either way arguing is a sign of a healthy relationship, not an unhealthy one
he also has a pretty extensive wikipedia page
that should be an option
lets see how long this lasts before mee6 flips it back
soon enough that collection's gonna have an integer overflow or something
greetings, squid.
drago
im shoving off bye
what in god's name is going on in here
flubs i don't like you
but you just said they shouldnt
im trying to prove a video wrong
most peoples first phone is an iphone
theyve done pretty fuckin well
by smashing a keyboard
lower cost making + higher cost selling  = more profit
that sounds fun
they deserve it though
then once this exam is done it's onto calculus and statistics
flubs
hence why they are a good fuckin company
but its been a while since i've had a full load of courses to deal with so
like the first 3 weeks of school i never procrastinate i always get the work in like asap and then after that i slowly start to let it slip
ill start catching up to you in about a month
brb then
i don't think so
lately i've noticed i dont really procrastinate assignments but i'll procrastinate everything else like my daily stretches for example
come on gummy
i have more duct tape than you have batteries
i'm calling the canadian equivalent of the fbi to put a giant magnet on your hard drive
zeke von genbu, chaotic bringer of chaos
(╯°д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \\)
it hasn't broke yet
or literally just mythra
i never knew that was a thing
who said it didn't?
but at the same time no
isn't that just like
they are better if you buy them from their website
holy shit you did
if my relationship works out i will need to learn the british pound sterling
if wages scaled like they did in the 50s
what?
yea prety much
function factorial(x){
```
   return (x>1)? x* factorial(x-1):1;
same until warframe
the human race deserves to die anyways
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
}
league is good
god damn i am addicted now
the exam was way easier than i thought it was going to be, i'd rate the practice exam a 10/10 difficulty, i give the final a 5/10 it was really tame
why not
~~tell me about it~~
plus im like pretty damn good at what the quizzes cover so it wouldnt be very good practice to just redo problems im already good at
alright now that you have that out of the way go play warframe
alduin plush
dont think so
i could have install windows 2000
those last two lines are contradictory
do you have a mic stand?
yea squiddy ya silly goose you
blitz what is my wedding present?
i can't watch this anymore
but my brain explodes every time i try
flubs is a smart.
youre the math nerd
so i take it magfest is a pretty big convention in terms of crowd size
shake me
lies and slander
imma tackle drago at magfest
im not going to pax
splatcord
maybe it is
man i may love muskets
welp, i've corrected some incorrect intuition now so i'll retake the practice test in a bit to see how i do with the correct way to approach problems i first got incorrect
planes were sturdy

thanks
im video games
oh god the intro
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
restarted my computer because it was being a butt
interesting
civ 6 and 5 are amazing
he doesnt play often though so i get it. im pretty sure he just walked into the encampment and lost
man i love war
or solitare
but when i teach you
it's like the blind leading the blind
instead of taking the bus
25 minute work on highway
it’s civ 6
in another country
laptop?
whiskey?
yes laptop
if you never hear from me again you can conclude i was axe murdered
well drago
the anasa's sold for 10 each
i suck at getting ayatans
no getting axe murdered today
no idea
it’s not too old
i swear this building purposely messes with signals
i have no idea what that is 🎉
sorry gummy
also thing
hasnt he been close to evil from the beginning?
any luck on finding more?
they go hand in hand usually
thought so
god damn it he's been infected also
thankfully rhino helps a lot
that class.. was stressful
no i meant something akin to this type of it
i'm still wondering why warframe suddenly became so popular among certain people
that's like
im gonna try weekly next
no but that was the last thing we were talking about and i couldn't be bothered to remember what makes graphs that looks like that
daily is a bit crazy
the relatively saine weekly version
nice
what cant count as a drug at that point
i would say spreadsheets if that didn't count as a drug for some of us. *opens up 3 more in google drive*
which is probably honestly worse for the floor at the bottom than your feet
see thats a requirement to get into ultra heaven
i had given up on it, but my brother started watching it so i would sometimes turn around and see it
that sounds like a really efficient way to not get anything done
and the newer episodes are actually more serious
can the non-affiliates still do highlights?
like, the entirety of the ultra space arc is really really good
its pretty much a video thing
i am very upset
hey hey hey i duplicated nothing
oh gosh darn it meesex
tfw warframe doesnt specify how long your locked from accessing your account
my one complaint about it is that it doesnt specify the amount of time until i can again
too many password attempts
its just an oversight but yknow
feelsbad
i didnt want you anyways
welcome <:hellothere:305560404715896832>
:pogg
there is a sub chat <:pogchamp:305560024443518986> lol
and didnt know it had to be an essay until today
that's a line they can access
you had to do that before?
yeah that's how i found out
i wanted to add another class
i actually used all the fancy shit on sheets recently
greetings, will.
my top two ones are about what i do every half hour and what songs i'm listening to
probably because he has to google "most boring way to articulate (x)" for every sentence
anivia vs zoe...
though that one girl is cute
yeah i hated the book so im seeing if this is better
i read part of the book and i have to say
go for it
no downsides.
i'm still deciding if my eyeballs want to read it though
ping
your favorite team is the chicago cubs!
i have this.
i mean like
what's the link there for?
link.
omg drago looks lame
oh cool
draco you're not allowed to use the internet any more
i think
its best is an idiot
whats the other jo then
~~well thats cause youre a mod~~
my gf plays zombie shooting games and stuff but says animal crossing is creepy
e sharper pointy stick
play pokemon red and blue
i’m back from work ya ninnies
us math nerds are a rare and special breed
i ~~stalked~~ had a look at all of my classmates' profiles and i'm the only one who uses github for things besides class
in 3
college is stupid
i stopped going in december
6 maybe?
i have one
nah go ahead
algebra is fun
if you have an interest in squid i'd suggest marine biology
that sucks
and that was just to test a thing for eyan
master if you're feeling like self-harm i can put you in contact with some people
hmmm
no, i have a job and i only use my money. but, they like bitching at me when i spend money on stuff they think is a waste of time
ah, gotcha
it works for me but lemme check some stuff first to make sure it doesn't explode if someone else uses it
that's like the same thing right
thats where the secret money comes in
i like how javascript doesnt give a fuck and just plain texts it
you can just make files end in whatever you want now?
i'll take that as a yea
whats that the code for?
if the new program was written properly it doesn't care what the file extension is, and just reads the header data in it to figure out how to parse it
oh look it's after one in the morning and all ive done in the last hour is google "whats the point of 4chan"
they won 1 and 3
eww that sounds horrible
im actually gonna say 100 thieves
"do you really want these kinds of people on the _normal_ part of the internet?"
they were pretty much "don't post anything that breaks international law (((((but if you post it on /b/ we're probably not going to moderate it)))))"
did google give you the answer you wanted to see
which quest?
third or fourth or nineteenth time i'm going to try to sleep today, wish me luck i guess
i’ve been lazy and am probably on the last part of the new strange
i think i gotta restart my laptop or just log out
yeah
you mean like stuck in one place until knocked down?
but that really is me
super weird
got a neo r1 lol
punching a hole in the window to escape is justified in situations like these
but update: they saw me blatantly ignoring me, huffed a little, and stopped talking
i sent the thing to dragonite
with that i'm going to go do food things bye
a little
100 thieves or tl?
i like how everyone doesn't even comment on gummy's name anymore
so for some reason i decided to look through my teacher's github thing to see what he'd been working on
we've just been so used to it to the point where it's just normal.
enough of that
so one of my cs teachers created a github organization for class
it would be flubs
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
i thought about it
god damn it
and no drago
my sister was pousghpigb b[itto'ns on' myu k/eyboaro'd'; he'[lp
you said so
which one was the one where... ah shit i dont remember any
i told myself i was going to work on bird game starting at 8
oh look it's after 11
i already wave a white flag
i was going to make a recursive screenshot of ms paint except paint is being stupid
he does that in every episode
this is the original video
\:thinking\:
question answer
i checked his reddit profile a few hours ago, he got snapped also
shed probably just scream
that's because your waifu is shit
so it is
(am i doing this right)
perfectly balanced. as all things should be
drago
whyyy
so will icbms
ahhhhh
yes to sm
ah fuck tomorrows monday
shit
my mom is ready
yay the light's on that means the battery didn't explode
the supergummying youtube channel will return
stream?
unless she's actually a competent person
you literally told me to get you banned
i need a name
notsupergummying
yes, and axes are good at killing pokemon
don't forget no wind
i like when ted talk(s)
finally someone with some brain cells in this channel
lesson 1
which is sogno di volare
my theme when i battle drago
i'll beat you in civ and total war
but intro music to that
why?
flubs front and center
most of it was simply theorizing how long his dragon's penis was
wait
friends?
man i’m still wide awake
<:rooisee:430400878302855177>
slee[
isn't tomorrow labor day...?
i asked
tsm got knocked out by c9
man i need better weapons
rhino skin should make that easy tho?
it honestly doesn’t last long sometimes
a pro at zd
oh they're league teams
it ended up hitting my leg hard
oh god i glitched the plains
i do!
huh. now im just gone in general
now im stuck
game borders are fun
no you don't
since supergummying is a curse name on youtube
you just can't youtube
lemme get back to you on that
ida 514 gummy 0
i also have
drago 1563 gummy 0
sorry.
she took you down to like 2 pokemon
discords been fucky for me lately. itll say i have a new message but not tell me the server or channel
just listen to friday
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
wow flubs you should find a way to make that trick work with money in real life
the plot's thickness isolates
its not raining, no
is it supposed to be raining?
so water isn't supposed to evaporate or is it just rain that's unremoved?
as time goes on i'm starting to get more and more nervous for calc, lol
yeah gummy about that
oh yeah ive been to _all_ the parties
no it's a convenient life hack that god forgot to remove from the release build
what can it be???
that took longer than it should have because photoshop was being a butt
most of what i remember of early calc is basically revolving around the unit circle
thank you
i don’t remember anything from calculus senior year of high school
cal-bc was where things were different from what i remember being told
ha photoshop
i know what to do now
youtube actually recommended me something good
interesting
but you will most likely break up before then
why is gummy benny?
oh sorry to hear that
and yeah what ida said
>implying family gets even
no she only has 514 points to your zero
they aren't
im just a wreck now
i know
lies
i mean what?
thats why im ignoring him ida
that emote makes no sense a honker is a large fish
ida actually has finger
are you sure?
fine
oh well i am planning on getting you one thing when i get a job
eh, it might sound like that
no, i'm icelandic
that your icelandic accent is like a drunk scottish accent
tbh mostly it's because i'm not good at vocalizing so everything sounds weird when i say it
only
either way wossman also said it
i don't drink coffee
i never swear
i kicked the addiction
yeah, let's go with that
<:mhxsleepy:362261093998919680>
it's 2 am
don't do drugs
that is dr wossname
i think i kind of just want a change of scenery after living in the same area for 17.75 years at this point
rc and i are twins
i remember people used to like him but now they might not
sandwiches are awesome
wow im actually understanding proofs, kugal did a thing!
is she cute?
greetings, ida.
i need you to come up with an obscure way to calculate the number "twelve"
help
wasp nests are scary
dont think it works that way
though most people do thankfully
true that
what does it mean to not feel tired
i have to feel like i want to read it myself
i'm streaming gummy, you should throw bits at me instead
it does, just gotta capitalize
i'm like 45% sure it is
does @eyan not ping anymore?
they pay better
how do you pronounce it?
you make a few good trades and you can probably avoid the grind
i need a new gummy
<:gwworkshopakashrug:398886014711496714> maybe you're a shower singer who wants to spread his wings a bit
its not the most noble strat but its one that works
at least it works
gonna need some axi's for that to work first
dragonite give me your creative writing class
gummy wanna go to creative writing for me?
i think i fell asleep before midnight
i kinda wanna add a third blanket to my bed
sick
...
gldd
god damn it
in other cool news
sounds like you understand your job, you just dont understand stupid people
ooooh nice
teacher: who knows javascript?
oh wait todays the fifth
no college for me on thursdays 👀
dragonite: [is only one who raises hand]
in lastvillage
dragonite: im not sure if that's the word i'd use
i was going to express my condolences and then remembered that there are some dumbasses who take ap english
teacher wouldn't even notice
way different from a town with 800 people
sounds pretty normal
so we by extension are neverlucky
how dare they
brad and i are in ap physics
university isnt high school
about?
gummy you arent in high school now
the community calls relics cabbages
i also, hope you realise i had a bunch of circumstances that allowed for me to leave regardless
i get up at 5:30 now 😄
well i wouldn't leave either way since this class is hard
i got 100% on my first stat test so that makes me happy happy happy
huh.
<:roosip:399827510776299520>
probably for masters other ~~random~~ star wars emotes
physics is fun tho
so probably 2.5 math classes
i love this university now
my classes start at 10 am everyday, sometimes 12 pm, but i must get up at 7 am to complete my assignments for the day by a reasonable hour
actually probably a better idea but fuck no
press f for kugal
also keep in mind i also got dem house chores to take care of
i liked how, in my statistics class, we could bring a notecard with as many formulas/examples as we could put on it for the final. mine was full, front and back 😛
fuck no
also he allows students to collect data together on laboratory assignments
my pre-calc-2 professor allowed us to have a 1 sided piece of paper for any formulas we could fit, and as much scratch paper as we wanted
make your own fork of jslint that doesn't judge you.
im saving up for sudden school fees
greetings, bella.
nice
and drago no
hai so delicate
often times i skip breakfast lol
like 20 minutes over due
can i visit>
~~i thought that was life~~
im gonna get phat
thats the answer im going with
for x/x
before 0
well the pi/epsilons leave you with with a huge positive and a huge negative which surely wont mean the same thing except for multiples of 180
mathway probably doesnt use a high enough x for its 10^-x
im gonna look at my next calc lesson
just gotta get another rare rock as an offering first
nice
reminds me i need to do my lab manual.
why does 100%ing a game have to take so long
it's about 45 cm away from my head when i fall asleep
speaking of that guy
sounds like a swell time
okay
big rip
*breaks whoever thought that waking up at 6:30 was a good idea*
but i have stuff to do anyway. feelsbad
break time
through the year?
watch me
pham
have fun dodging bow
you have no friction
as soon as something went into motion it wouldn't stop
im in physics class right now
next lesson is on limits at infinity
what
i can see what all of the other students in my highschool are taking as college courses through the dual credit program
from what i've heard and observed
and when you divide anything by zero you get infinity
because we can't comprehend it.
maybe that was the universe also
i'm not talking about the observable universe. all i'd say is that if the rest of the universe is not observable, why would we come to the conclusion that it's infinite?
excuse you public static main doesn't compile
when the fallout is distributed evenly, the explosion happened everywhere, never showing signs of ending, thus making us think it's infinite
keep learning
i unsubscribed from pbs space time like two years ago because all of their videos were pretty much the same thing
so we can't definitively say it's infinite
the big bang
unconvinced of what, im confused lol
i think he prefers the word omnipresent
and then you have logarithmic intervals as the video professes
i never saw that video but i kept seeing it in my recomendations
i like to think of it more as the boom happened everywhere instead of one spot
arguably yes and no
why do you have so much water?
why the hell was i testing live streams yesterday?
let me go to sleep now
arguably
huh. just finished reading eldest
and apparently the monado had a hidden monado and that hidden monado had a secret dickson that had a hidden monado. and now my head hurts
agreed, anyways, i got a game to play.  stop by my stream sometime, peace.
im slowly moving my desk away from people
yeaaaah...  too bad that uh, didn't work out, lol
why not
do subatomic particles and the void experience boredom?
but i’m sure this semester i will at some point. yay.
i'm over halfway through the day
work in terms of what, kugal?
i forgot my keyboard was broken _cri_ can someone at dragonite for me?
so i just had an email convo from my prof and he kinda gave me the impression that as soon as im done with math181 i just move onto math182 next semester
draco im going to make _your_ brain hurt
oh okay
mkay..maky..
thats confusin to me
spazzer the great
so yeah
delicate is playing
holy moly
and how strong they emphasis that course
just as soon as you do a semester of math181 is bam math182
some courses last six months
<:walkthroughwizard:372149588783529994>
thanks but no thanks, already enrolled in a university.
i could recommend some books for pre-uni study
aka you need to pass the prereq
i saw a robbery
online courses yeesh
jeesh
im going to walmart today
the guy just had something and went through the backdoor
you're a criminal now delicate
hey magus i gotchu sum questions
oh dat
are you all from the us?
i haven't gotten the kill order from eyan for it yet
the role
well eh
we have very eloquent discussions here as you can see
then cardinaloscl is mainly for storing information on a per-server basis so i can have custom welcome message display for the bot.
but first index runs all weekend for credits
oh i never knew that existed
i use flutter bot
welcome home
thanks i needed that
i think?
i joined yesterday
because thats how terribly these tests are made
oh yeah my dsi had a l button that was perma-on
rip superskarmory.net
oh is nick on this server too?
hes fuckin seven during the oldy times?
i feel like there's a bot command for this brb
i wonder what gummy wanted while i was making foods
you tell them how fucking wrong that is
thats crazy
oh i see
lmao
but america has more boat
nice
i live in equestria
yeah and its also much worse. puerto rico sucks now
sometimes i am a crime
bc you didnt reply the first 5 times?
well you will if you try to leave america
programming class
ok maybe its a *little* bigoted
florida wars = seminole wars
was it bc of she who will not be named that nick left? was the question i pinged you for
that's racist
imma become a professional poker player
gummy look up the australian emu war on wikipedia it's my absolute favorite
the end
sets of 15 points for the win
that sounds like affirmation
i hope so
or lie down
oh btw here to share a rumor
but the release date for the next update was moved to the 14th
i just finished reading the 7 chapters i was supposed to read by wednesday this week xp
haaaaaaaaaaalp
welp it's been 4 hours sicne i've started on statistics
seems like besides eyan
dragonite is a flying spaghetti monster
yeah that won't work
but i think that can actually cause brain damage
i think i have a photo of it somewhere let me look
gummy you realize all i have to do is give him treats and he swears his allegiance to me f o r e v e r
what the fuck
he said something about dying
my headphones are being fucky nobody say anything interesting
once done with these league games gotta farm reactant
nice
i have no idea what youre talking about
submitted my second calculus assignment. i hope the professor likes it
nice
nice. i sold my nyx prime neuros finally
this leson goes over first, second, and third derivatives...cool
i've taken 42 pages of notes in the first chapter of calculus, wow lol
im tempted to join but more tempted to see if it will work
i don’t get how, last time i exported a 35 minute video, it took a little under 2 hours to export. today, it’s only going to take 50 minutes instead.
wtf why do i have 82 plat now
~~keep subway in the subway~~
are you eating a subway in a subway?
hey subway is good
bread is nice and stale?
kill 42 with finishers without going down
have fun with that
only the splodiest memes for us
who needs to open them
air is stupid
he’s our math boi
not rn
i have a total of 54 credits.
all good
college
she almost went through a breakup so that won’t help
well one semester and three months since for some reason you can't graduate in february
hello
hello new person
i think with how much stupidity is going on at the very moment, that probably won't matter
no never
but i brought wolf
oof mauling citizens is fun though.
(guys i think the new guy is a perfect replacement for me)
hmmmm
don't worry as long as we beat the enemy
friend
(i am officially retiring)
gummy is replaced
not within the kingdom at any rate
what happened
also make sure you give blitzypoo ding dongs
you lied
no you cant
_dangles treat in front of spazzer's nose_
flubs took care of that
jazz hands
i can now
silly gummy
i crossbreeded the explotatoes with corn and made none exploding ones
i would insult dragonite
<:doit:334014889137930240>
he did
solve p=np
"kulga"
the p isn't just replaced with a number
spazzer, i will say the most fun person to talk to about math out of everyone here is flubs
no clue
258 in an 8 bit system
see ya gum
isnt that the one thing with triangles
hence the it doesnt equal one
xini
depends
as x approaches 0 of 3+x, the value of 3+x will be 3
pat friend?
i dotn followe
"258 in an 8bit system"?
yeah no
they have to
but technically in order to find the numbers we'd need to rack up a supercomputer for hours
it multiplies them to that exponent?
there is a solution
basically x^-n = 1/(x^n)
yeah i know about the check thing but not the other crazy stuff
or the existence sign?
probably
that wacky character is a radicand
so positives make it bigger and negatives make it smaller
why not use +
compactness
it can but it will revive if people are still alive
whats 0^0
yea pretty much
ok so like what level is this math that im learning here
i always had a hunch
i used to be smart you know
says you
i have a question
yeah well it's neither
well
it gives an area
me too
when would you ever use long division
at midnight
cs majors almost as bad as physics majors
i dont wanna be the reason you fuck up your sleep schedule
yee?
an argument in 5th grade
so yep
which could approach one
like geophysics for a magnetostatics course
or a senior actuarial analyst
physics teachers in general are fun
in physics
computers usually cant handle a lot of errors
it varies so much from place to place i dont even know
and you *pay* for it to be harder
they own the hospitals?
then how do they pay for all the expensive shit in them
welcome to canada
government owned
like longer vacations
nope
better credit
sure. if youre a ceo you get millions, low taxes, and you can do whatever you want
thats so weird
you can rent a house easier
so more corporations get involved
free healthcare
no here
jesus christ
they make a lot of money
but your credit rate is in the 800s
you want mine?
do you have a spare or is that your only one
every year
back to volt i go
if you plan on using melee weapons at any capacity
now to roll it
aw that was short
youre asking me to change chairs, find the thing, come back, switch chairs again, and then talk hushed like so i dont wake sarah up
yeah
yeah i have a couple i’ve been lazy about
"i am definitely my boyfriend" -gummy just ow
tony stark
is clem even here?

what gave it away?
~~i knew ida was never really a human~~

wait what
who are you and why are you patting me
awww cat
what
fuck you mom
my homework can suck an egg becuase i now understand this stuff
i'm your mother, of course i'm of age
seemsgood
i'm hungry
you are forever shunned from this point on. *shuns the shunned*
i can make a longer and scarier word
help flubs
checkmate
me_irl
i'm bored
this is spreadsheet abuse unlike what dragonite has ever seen
ida is mine
no clue
that's not scary
glad to see you missed me
anyone feel like grinding for lith in a few minutes
good lord
right now i have a gf to deal with
one sec
all the surv missions have equal drop rates
this is dark sector?
i was briefly very confused by that statement
i know that
i need octavia part from it too
do you still need any mesos?
im getting close to having enough for all frames
works for me
am doing a calculus lesson
thats a no go
being social is the worst
i'm in a karaoke
in what context?
<:lul:305559915714576385>
great now i have some racer's life insurance
two dragonites
i need to think of a better symbol for g in my crypt
btw spaz this is a playlist of music eyan generally likes
or seeing the things on the laptop?
right click on botface
so you went into some rando's house and they told you it was pizza and you believed them without doing any prior research of your own
that's not so bad
i didn't want pizza
leo mcgarry
and freedom fries
papa john's is bad
so i win is what youre saying
thats just when everything gets boring
among other things the heisenberg uncertainty thing sorta stops working because you know the momentum (zero) and you know the position (unmoving)
absolute zero breaks physics
once you hit absolute zero you can never regain energy
because quantum physics gets weirder the closer we get to -273'16
yeah that many pa on individual *atoms*
once the uncertainty principle fails
yeah exactly
probably need more than that for solid hydrogen
the entirety of quantum physics starts get loopy
i like breaking physics
so thats 2.4e-15 newtons per atom
assuming atoms are square which is wrong but its mostly the order anyway
somewhere
apple products are gross
somewhere
digitizer.
gravity on neptune is only 11.15 m/ss
rocky road ice cream?
why are there two ses
vanilla chocolate and strawberry
when did i say i wanted a light black hole?
of helium
i was talking about solid helium for thep ast half hour
and turn it down to 2%
so its a function and not a method, got it
well, anything for science...
everything changes mass
and accidentally made penicillin instead
they were trying to find a cure for something else
tnt was when this one guy forget to wash his clothes
master you've been hacked by draco
volta
discord has been giving a lot of poops lately instead of page previews
it's great
is that your final answer
just never get a job and live in their basement
when moving
are they also a piñata?
youre cleaning it up
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  a a aaa   a a aaa          a

anyone feel like doing more b4 grinding
hello there
someone lost the sign
is that a yes or a no?
imma look at my next calculus lesson
excuse me?
let's go with fractal, why not
next calculus rules goes over product and quotient rules in differentiation
holy moly it's a short lesson too
5 pages long, the average lesson is about 10 pages or sometimes even crazier like 15 pages
also known as: colds suck
it tastes like stale nothing
just dont do other things
neato
you're a plant?
and what country has plants that talk
youve never had anything
til kugal is outside the universe
theres nothing wrong with setting someone on explosion
i did that once
i hate freshman and all they are made of
can confirm
i dont mind english
what
if you get understood who gives a fuck
or _being_ a freshman
and im still horrible
oh no, now he's ripping off animal\_man\_.
away faithful servant
what
im surprised you found a way to open a box that had no door on it
if there was no uni i'd prolly reach kilwala in one day
did it have victory road music?
work takes away my motivation to do anything
i technically sent someone somethign nsfw once
~~i can change that~~
yeah yeah
if i was friends with only emotionally chaotic people
that's all im gonna say on that matter
most of my dms is me either shitposting, having a mental breakdown, or nsfw things
and last night he was having a tough time
so i guess you can throw windows out of windows if you envision the object your throwing out as a window
gummy dont be lewd
ida you’re stable enough
so i'm worried
im just worried that my family will disown me when they find out im dating a transgender
so think what would happen to me
i'm just complaining about you using an adjective as a noun, tbh
or mugged than shot
so it’s tough for her when her family calls her a guy
eh i'll take it
welp
mugged then shot
will they shoot you through the screen?
kinda
so how is my replacement?
that was the last thing i needed for boltor
that's rich coming from the guy that keeps throwing junk out the window
you only blew up the food? that's unusually civilized of you
no it's just a big lava lamp
didnt i just put you in time-out for wasting food?
hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
i had a good response to that but i forgot it
no just the comic pages
im serious
drago i’ll battle you once i finish streaming ultra sun and moon
we'll see what happens faster: my beard reaches the floor or you finish sm
what game can we play together
slam the door
like mount and blade
because i think this quiz is either wrong or im just stupid
my dads place had that and it always died loudly and violently
actually that's an expression that goes around tech columns from time to time i want to actually look up how much computing power nasa _actually_ had in the 1960s
(◡‿◡✿)
mind stone: yes
but can thanos convince dragonite's sister to take a cs class, is the real question
volleyball
but i want a giant cupcake
oh youre playing dodgeball or something
that's fun too
my physics teacher roasted me today
also i think i have 20 neo limbo relics
oooh
there was also pizza and i drank a bit too much lukewarm tea
why is that surprising
oh i guess i did
if this was fight club
i have fallen asleep with them on numerous times before tho
now it'll be pretty
how so
do people not do that
i wanna fight andi now
to everyone on the east coast right now, please stay safe and be careful 🤗
oh shit
the best part about that was when i got home
getting assigned an essay on the same day its due
that damage is probably in the millions: i got some 300k crits
welp
to be processed
it's my home time that's poorly spent, either napping, watching youtube, or thinking to myself "i should stream stuff"
if you can pick me up then fuck it i'm down, but i doubt it
im already used to spazzed making no sense but i dont get what rainy is talkin gabout either
i've been able to pick up everyone i've evert met
enterntaining in general or if youre there rainy?
ahh blokes and their dick measuring contests, always annoying, but always entertaining
you considered streaming?
they do that well enough on their own thank you very much
yo cool
good job
boy oh boy
then i got anotha essay to writ
i dont know if i should be in awe of the internets stupidity or appalled
he died from essay overdose
you get an essay and you get an essay and you get and essay and you-
have you tried warframe?
i just hope i installed my graphics card stuff correctly
i dont hear you at all
i'm still here tho
oh wait
it is already useful
absolute values linearize absolutely
why smelt a katana
on the bright side, this 20 pound chunk of scrap metal is great for working on like muscle stability

you're hearing me
the latter of the two
the fifteenth commandment clearly says that `thou shall not put chocolate and tomato on the same pizza`
google is never wrong
that is absurd
shit not again
raise the air sirens the pants are on the loose
don't?
no cookie would ever combine chocolate with tomato
that doesnt make it a cookie
where did they run off to this time
thirteen doesnt exist
apologise to google
my job here is done
your job is to beat yourself?
what is that?
what is your job
but i like it flubs
hold on im turning dead robot zombie hearts into jedi focus points to let myself have better mana regen
its nice
and he like discover gravity
like an eagle piloting a blimp
same
no idea ive never played it
where is jeff and the winter raid on that scale?
worst
uninstall it or turn off the phone if you have to
i was playing a hexadecimal arcade game and got a bit behind on cs notes about date time storage even though he was talking about dd,mm,yy and hh,mm,ss and i explained unix to him after the class was over
i can't understand
master's grandma confirmed to be gummy's professor
missed half the notes
she would be mistress8998
i write notes on my laptop for film class
to be honest you're not of magnitude to be a headache
eh could score around a b
citrus just got a lot more fun

look at these nerds getting sleep
nice
i have to be up at 6:30
easy
how does that even work spazzer lol
hai gummy
flubs
oh ok
i heard flubs
he sleeps from like 10ish until 6ish and then idk what he does when im gone but its probably just more sleeping
what happened?
is a service doggo?
how does begging turn into yelling?
that's rude
oh i thought it would have been more like bumping into him hard
you don't give like 100 chances
but why would you do that?
speaking of which
no cat noises
or rawr
nooo
yeet i ruined everything
plot twist i didnt go to bed i stayed up and read comic anthologies for two hours
just got back home
almost two?
i got all nostalgic when playing pokemon mystery dungeon when i remembered his old vids on those games. it's nice to see his community still active
it's been a long time
at least apples costs are up front instead of $100 for os and sometimes it fucks up and also $100/year for basic stuff that comes preinstalled to be activated
i just email the lady my info and she does all her facy stuff and my parents do other fancy stuff boom bank account
also my parents are helping me open a bank account which is cool
something like that
but no one ever asked for my solution
then you just roll that up in a layer of antimatter and bam you created a black hole
as many potatoes as is humanly possible
definitely
thats the best name
nah its just drago 2.0
e!skarm original joke
there are infinitely more solutions where p != np
salt
e!kill dragonlite
fuck yeah
also his friend is a fast man with a funny mask
"oh you're too good at our game. you don't deserve to be summoned." - with love, from software
he is the largest
good job dark souls
oh man i have figured out statcrunch
hes great. he also has an evil twin who makes you eat fire
also speaking of getting good at dark souls i hope i can do that soon
do you mean patches
but that's not a crime
""don't quote on me on that" master 2018" - squidofbaconater 2018
abomination of nature
everything
i agree with the dragon guy
"don't quote on me on that" master 2018" - squidofbaconater 2018 -spazzer the great
agreed
it's larger than a gallon
now go get a gallom of ice cream\
nerds
it's funny the 16th time
typically we discuss the bunches of reading we do. really depends on the authors. like we go on about their thoughts on matters important to the time.
cs data structures: waste my time
cs digital media programming: do stupid things with chickens
i don’t like them either
i haaaaated reading lord of the flies
sessino not found
disturbing the peace
that is most definitely a question for her
lord of the flies
oooh
oh dear bella
isnt harry potter just the bible but on even crazier drugs?
since we had to pick the book
i read them all way back in elementary. good times
true story apparently
a different read but a good one nonetheless
they’re more of an elementary/ middle school thing, blitz
kugal i have a question
well, more like 2
i didnt have to read any book in sophomore, i had to read a book in first year
or were you thinking yu-gi-oh and you though of the pieces?
my first thought was the millenium pyramid or whatever it’s called
i dont think the level of math classes im in were determined on my smartness really
the poincare conjecture was probably my favorite unsolved problem to learn about
bite sells for a nice chunk of plat and forma is self explanatory
if we're being really technical
depending on what you mean on hole, sure
probably gonna die soon
plus those anti toxins to boost the rather low odds
the table is that way. *points towards a hole in the ground*
i like this green fellow
friday has ida
here too
wait what
that too
its a 3 letter word, do you expect it to never come up in conversation?
its free
squid you are an invention from phineas and ferb
i would pillage rome
hes a bac*onator* not inator
squid from hence forth you shall be the squidofbaconinator
and i like ceasar
allow me this as a late birthday present
i was just gonna move it up a bit but that works too
also known as the eastern roman empire master
does that count?
idk how to spell it
it broke like, 4 times?
therse also a spike for me around 1300 bc to 1100 bc where trojan war happened
by then we had evolved past muskets which were fading out over that century in favor of actual good weapons
that and industrial age was end of colonial and final nail in the mideival coffin
i discover donations on twitch
oh shit yeah
tbh i had some interest in romans, a little greek and egyptians
turn my name back to green! pls
honestly who needs to remember these things when you can just draw a little picture when you actually have to
you should give him all your money
wouldnt that make it harder to digest
you tell me dragonite how easy is it to eat one?
then again i might not, i'd have to add up my credits and see if i can fit it in
the introductory cs course is 3 credits
kugal why are you in an english class
well she went to look for a female eevee with a nature she liked
i imagine that's relatable
i enjoy english
who knew saying nothing and just getting yelled at could be so draining
im not giving her the time of day
well she called me
in practice theyre more like 103, 104 and maybe 106
and?
i agree, good point
sarah yelled at me
do you mean outside my apartment or in general
she called me many bad words. also called me an "ungrateful bastard"
ok so maybe it was one
not sure what i should be grateful for
but then i realize i probably was being mean
what do i do
it's strong
that's a noni
it was like $129
headache inducing, maybe
exponential derivatives are that easy?
last 10 mins of ap physics was throwing around paper airplanes
well go get a cat
go play with your cat or something
and pet
is that still a thing
also i like this part of the chart
have you ever tried to teach a cat tricks?
i thought all moms did this - no not really
idapoo would also work but ideepoo sounds better
i wish i could say the same
whats the advantage of online classes
better than infinitely bad is still infinitely bad
ive brought this on myself havent i
plus i cant drive cos im a moron, lol
i like that
driving is easy
which enhances it for me
i hate it when that happens
other names it goes by sometimes sound like "formal logic" if that means anything to you
the list just barely didnt fit on the screen, 255 is discrete math somehow and 256 is linear algebra
nope they dont offer math130 😦
wow my stat test today is 5 questions
wait
ouch
appreciate it buddy
100%on stat test woop woop
nintendo direct just happened
also good job
wait
not anymore. now theyre dead
whomst aboot
good
hooray for books and food
you just answered your own question
i dont want to eat a rock covered in mud
a what did a what and played what and where was i
there are too many darn fortnite videos
that's a good amount
he has uploaded over 2000 isaac videos total
nice
drago you have to hear it to know it
my goodness
you know i said in the literal sense
squid dont encourage him
oh cool whens that coming out
i gotchu squid
also
anyway, for warframe, i've heard rumors about that going on the switch, so i'm not too surprised with it going on the thing plus it's on every current gen console thus far
there’s no 2nd “s”
you'd have to design games for instances regarding the multiple modes the switch has, though
~~xenoblade x~~
i know mario maker hasn’t
> .txt.txt
plaaaaaaay something else
master dare i ask _how_ it crashes
so you have to play twenty dollars a year to play a game. why would you do that
but i still think they need their own loveroms/emuparadise type of system instead of what they got for the nes games
im actually rewiring slon to be 2% cleaner
they kinda have ongoing costs
gta v is pretty expensive. now that one is pretty crazy
so why not put your games on the money printer
he didn’t like our money talk
nice
nice
and also steam prints money
if its on steam someone is gonna buy it. example: i bought 8 copies of robot rollerderpy disco dodgeball
whatever pisses you off the most
me rn
my ram has solace
the only thing about that service that i'm still unlikely to try out is nintendo's voice chat. i know they're oldschool with a lot of their decisions, but a mobile app for online voice chat makes little sense even for their standards
has she seen a vet yet
axi s3 and v7, specifically
just looked at it. it’s crazy how far and wide it hits the east coast
how do you think that is?
i should just learn to code in my sleep
fucking finally an s3
you’re in the path of it?
and the answer checker liked to do things like mark `x=5 m/s` wrong because it was looking for something like `x = 5 m/s`
decisions, decisions
fuck it
so i have an english essay tomorrow
more or less <:gwovoraphixd:390538507799494658>
i have a thing due monday which probably means im going to get started after dinner on sunday
im already getting started on my essay
except for yesterday when the janitorial staff kicked me out
(okay so a half hout later im _actually_ going to make an effort to kick myself off the computer bye)
t=+1 hour and still cant sleep, as per usual
i just spend my day off doing all of my homework
where is dragonite and what did you do with him
you dedicate one day to homework?
i need problems to invent stuff to solve for a class
hmmm
priorities are s3 and v7
can you react with both to this message
technology has gone too far
give me problems
heko
this is nothing.
he wants us to collect data together and i just wanna do it solo halp
*slaps roof of cipher* apgt dpewp trebawqq bfdoq horcwhp

<:pogchamp:305560024443518986>
add me if you want
am or pm
out of astronomy, time to finish this english essay
i live on the edge
i am talking to a guy that used to be in the military
hes helping me with my resume
so how did you decide i would get that one?
im up for grinding now btw
or is that just a random one in my possession?
new pokemon looks amazing
me hungry
eh, i'll do it tomorrow
greece
i should demand a refund on the grounds that the computer science department isn't excruciating enough
remember how i joked about doing my homework a half hour ago? i still havent started
it has been many moons since i have had a steak
estimated time to takeover: 6-10 years
look at the picture
thats the time that matters
flubs do you rule the world?
fair enough
i got a good insult
learning games
im pretty sure its legally impossible for a disabled person to hold a position of power. have you *seen* all the stairs the buildings in dc have?
nope
so much frigging effort
he wouldnt take the thing with him
today i learned that dippin dots has its own cereal.. :
flubs
alright just venka gauntlet and scindo blade left
it was cookies n cream flavoured
whatcha up to
who's good with computers here btw?
with nothing to play it on because when i suggested i get the ps2 that was $10 more than it instead and i told her i only had one game she said to get another game
aqua relic grinding?
because windows 7 is great and windows 8 and windows 10 aren't.
and again it won't stay in the middle of the screen when i drag it there, and reopen it
i hated them.
nope
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
i really need a better rhino set up 🤔
watch as it's amiibo festival deluxe
no effect
why is that even a question
i need a sister that fits under my category
oh the horror
drago wanna trade sisters?
if i ever make fun of your code style again just remind me that you have a twelve-year-old sister
my gf making mudbray noises
more like that microsoft charges $100 per year for their software
your dog making cat noises
this is what a mudbray sounds like
also t=+3.25 hours and still cant sleep
my hearing is pretty bad
and put your ear next to his stomach
all the other days are just night, for there is no sun
spazzer you haven't lived until you've beaten games that are older than you are
i had no reference so i thought they were good
flubs
like how there’s a venom movie without spider-man
emo spiderman.
maybe if you're still playing in like 1 - 2 hours from now i can certainly play
barely <:roothink:399827523581771796>
and also the first kirby game but that doesnt count since it's only like three levels
demon lord stop being old
i swear to god axi s3 only starts appearing at night
sure so you just *happened* to shoot me through the smoke and a wall
according to gummy im an octopus
speaking of skyrim
youre turning into gummy
"cane" -> [kayn]
the sad part about me gambling is that this is actually more fun than the game itself...
panda stop
alright
it's from that one berenstein bears book
here lies panda
which is very tiny but almost looks vaguely familiar
bonus fact: i would've done it anyways
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<:gwnonaismug:373159826525519872>
you shant be forgiven
kugal wanna trade sisters
hmm, bella's not muted that is quite the rare sight
i too like panada's
come back tomorrow *slams gate*
gummy needs to learn how to promote himself <:gwossumikuyawn:395628757932834818>
i mean water can be synthesized as a product of cellular respiration and stuff
this one? <:gwahreevampysmug:369468206735425546>
twitter is the best social network there is, but that's like saying that
i guess i'll just have to live with this minor annoyance
did someone say chickens
flubs i love how worked up youre getting over this
i actually updated right after the update since it failed to install an update
good job windows
flubs
pnada is cheater
update the update
demon lord why must you encourage gummy thus
hey master fun fact: you're at least 85% of the fact i don't believe in the pc master race
bye pnada
you should joint he party
flubs let's be honest
if i wasn't so lazy i'd dig out the discord join/drop sound effects and then play them infinitely into my mic just to confuse you
ida is still up 👁
exactly
i remember drawing a snowy owl for a project back in third grade all you see is a giant bird with tiny stick like legs and feet lol xd
is four the only number with the same number of letters?
master are you compensating for something
master stop being stupid, demon lord stop trying to argue with stupid
bella and aminal
there's a green and blue
wait two
pink nu squid and draco, masa mune wolve and rc, red animal man and bella
cosmic chancla
gummy is cheating
i update it monthly
do you keep up with this or is it constantly updating?
over summer break i filled out about 78 sheets for a group and they were oh jesus what the flip is that
you have too much time on your hands
black holes suck, fun fact, but we can't see them, so guess what that means??? paradox space!!!!!
master9000.isabutthead=true;
its not a toggle
twitch twitch
you do have time
yeah
no i mean like all the other people who are red you cant see it
yeah
hello hello hello lol ^w^
in other news dogs in cars are fun
i played as waluigi i think
i have officially bandwagon from tsm to c9
you can only trade primes
and it was one fight that cody fucked up
be at worlds
i don't even hate zven/mithy
to what degree of certainty do you say that
bothering mom about useless shit
or an array of booleans
i believe so
and c9 getting the infinity gauntlet
now i'm getting flashbacks to chessmaster 9000.
i mean
which is their week 1
you _knew_ that already\
remember, they have to go through play ins
today “drop the whole fucking team”
yesterday “we are gonna 3-0 c9 and crush everyone at worlds”
nice
anasa 10
socjust block everyone on twitter gummy, easy
i just import it to gimp
the one holiday i hate
or stay off twitter
got 3/5 becuase of the screwed up questions
hey kugal
can you display that to three significant digits?
yeah but master if you work the night shift that implies you can sleep during the _day_
thats about what i expected
another point for online homework
sure
good job discord mobile
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
0.00002%
two hours until class starts and i dont have anying to do and my phone's on 30%
hey kugal
ask him if i can turn it in as my poetry assignment for my writing class
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
see pins
i was charging it and totally forgot about it
hmph
i didnt do any of that yesterday anyway
i just got a spare flow if anyone needs it
the one that tells me to stop
trynig to get boltor prime now
the tsm subreddit discord server is huge
yo anyone want hate i got a spare
what skarm
last year, the most passive aggressive class(es) were geometry, earth science, algebra 2, and thats about it, they were all equally passive aggressive
huh. maybe it was the teachers at my school. we had really bad science and math teachers
also salty
im with you gummy
the correct answer is "not enough"
and chemistry sounded like it sucked for many, so i'll take earth science
food poisoning is just buckets of fun at kfc
they weren't very easy essays either
chemistry deals with math after all, but the teacher was notorious for not being very good
maybe
taco time
what the fuck kugal
thats where we get tacos
i agree
can i have any leftover tacos?
tacos and the tears of yellow dragons
ok ok good
did someone say tacos
though i think it’s to do with this block of buildings
mission so far successful
cavalry charges
a massacre
what are the reqs?
ahh i see kugal has discovered the internet
film class showed me a movie on that
complete a survival mission with level 30 or higher enemies without killing anyone
i just don't know if the mod itself is good
last i checked soma was considered good
i'm waiting until a friend gets up to tell me
my head feels funny
i'm in the mission
looks funny too
or just shave the entire face
i prefer that
i will give you some of my leftover popeyes chicken
you want me to be nice to my case?
thats like asking why a baby needs food to live since it needs less than an adukt
speaking of cacti, has that one guy said anything recently?
i havent been paying attention
drago using a good mic
much easier
this does not bode well
nope
darn
stop being so smart you weirdo
i dont want to _that_ much though
flights

what do you have in your inventory that you're so unwilling to part with?
my physics teacher said he likes how he picks on me and i just roll with it
and whats your ipv4 being ab.cd.ef.10 would sound silly
if you bend it far enough _everything_ can be an integral sign
this is changing the subject a bit but my teacher wanted to do audio stuff in js today
well who knows maybe i deserve it
master what are you even doing in there
poor you <:kappa:374346980136058893>
well, there's no such thing as a stupid question
nobody does
thats why we elect to ignore it
there are no stupid questions, but there are stupid people asking such questions
though some are admittedly purposely made stupid, for jokes
because people use the definition of stupid so loosely, getting a fact wrong makes some people go from sir isaac newton to nemrod in some people's eyes
oh cool so the new 2000 series cards are a waste of time
ah, gotcha
remake voicemeeter banana in js. <:keepo:327304799919800321>

my advice is stop being a bitch baby and if they want to be a bitch baby let them
hint: its ketar
now her internet is out and she has barely any data left
because i was boosted and briefly thought guardian was aftershocik
they also have metal
it's torture
i oddly enjoy looking at stuff i can’t buy and have no use for
so you can find what you want, write it down, and then buy it from somewhere specialized
rona is better
home depot is great
both places were good but we go to lowes more now
it's bad
sure

"and here we have a super gummying in his natural habitat"
and drago can be a guest on the show
i should clean out the pins one of these days
no be mean its funny when someone else does it
or you could always just inhale it
try putting it in the freezer
maybe you could try loading it into a water pistol
maybe a fire hose would be better
previews are nice sometimes
like e!kill but cheese
as a computer engineer my solution to problems is usually rebooting, blaming the programmers, or throwing more resources at it
there's kiosks to trade prime parts for them
e!wolfram 13 gmt
gotcha
he comes every two weeks
if i run a sortie rn i don't have to log on when i have to do homework later today
i just acted like i knew what i was doing

~~good point.~~
i had someone in my server thinking the nazis were good...how does this happen in a non public server
it's like forcing a biologist to write a paper on physics
let people major how they wanna major
i don’t know if you get a degree with minors or not so, actually don’t know
i googled it and wish you luck draco bc i wouldn’t know how it’d go together either

my bio lab today has something to do with measuring volume...

my mom went back to school at 36
if you wanna teach you gotta definitely get masters

kavat cudes up rn if you need them

first day of fall and it should be 90+
too bad i still have no idea how to get bacon in this game

sorry to hear that flubs
youtube was barely a year old
im gonna zone out to space music the rest of the day
but then again driving on li looks horrible
indeed
~~wasn’t the internet always stupid?~~
unfortunately the people who do drunk driving and road rage also happen to be the people who are least likely to give up their keys
let me introduce you to this nifty little thing called "human nature"
vsauce michael here
thatd be pretty cool
or something like that, lol
same
through x^.5 form or?
im guessing itd just be the factorial of the factorial of the original number
6th i think actually
yea i think i may just use double factorial
i just gave you a much better name for it
man one assignment for literature takes a few solid hours, its impressive
kugal is a happy boi
english teacher?
author master
don’t know yet
yeah but being an author is risky and dependent on success
i’ve come to realize i’d rather be happy and doing what i like than be unhappy and dreading work everyday
good idea
which is nice
oh yeah peaceful places
i should teach kids war
who?
play them my songs in return
i tried to listen to that but i couldn't finish
how the fuck will more music help me hear less music
mostly chroma doing tons of dmg

sedna has an interesting side character
after 7 more missions than shouldve happened
i have a key left if you two want to use it
thonk
very appropriate
it's actually not
i remember watching nsmb walkthroughs when i was like 7
i started watching during pokémon diamond
that's really sad
there was never a time in my life where having a nintendo system was "cool"
that being said i am going to buy a 3ds when i get a job

yeet selling out is awesome
oh wait my sub expired
life goals
there are phones that cost over $2000?
what the crap it's autumn now?
god all four seasons are just godawful arent they
i say to the canadians in the room
wow this is.. a lot
also drago you forgot the *allergies* in the 3 that arent winter
<:lul:305559915714576385>
you don't
its just slush
someone kill me now
not looking forward to walking to the bus stop in -20 weather tho
winter time is skyrim time
also new york snow is fuckin garbage
winter time is magfest time but im pretty sure thats just because winter coincides with when the convention center is cheapest
no squid would be playing it on a smart window
that takes skill
squid is normal hes prolly asleep
if they ever do you restart

but it's only 3 am
someone told me to go to sleep
zenurik is super strong energy regeneration
allows you to take an aura like corrosive projection
and now that you can hunt teralysts you also have arcane buffs to start collecting
as per usual
what's the challenge?
sounds fun
it’s cool that they gave a riven
gonna try to sleep now
like +30% strength
you say that like it's a good idea but then you realize steam games take a month to patch/download there
whats the difference between a butt ton and a normal ton
guys
i think you mean a shit ton
\:thinking\:
assuming the butt is predominantly meat with a small layer of fat
its so much easier
oh you mean ripping off of r/writingprompts class
i realize drago has beaten me in every social media
minus the "social" part
goood
flubs convince him
this is going to be like the old days of youtube when your only impressions were you and your mom isn't it
on every site
they can *do* that?
gonna go watchwestwing();}
i thought windows used ntfs
"well we've already shipped fifty million of the things, too late i guess"
that's what "formatting" means right
maybe i can misspell all of the names a different way every time and see if anyone notices
just bp/mods/ayatans
how long is break time?
*breaks dra*- oh wait, he did it himself
you don't know about that meme, majestic?
break time
all you have to do is dip a piece of paper in the septic tank and then take a picture of it with a really low-quality camera
or if you're behind the times, impact font.
would corrosive font be writing with acid?
now i want to google "corrosive font" and see what comes up
latin likes to play loose
i dont think this one has a right answer
rates of change and other not-exciting stuff
make what a thing
i don't blame them <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>

"acually (a) it's been like that since the dawn of the internet, and (b) have you tried 4chan?"
everything's a library card if you bribe the librarian with enough
good thing i have a few more pairs of pants and all those trousers that the flat earth folks sent me
it's all mems
stardust protection
woah
well it's actually more like a record label
i'm going to file that under "could be worse"
basically
they're an emerging marketplace right now
gummy just finish moon already i want to wipe the floor with you
that was master's bad idea not mine
its like calling mtv a song producer
actually
no she is pissed at you
yes yes yes yes
16,318,782 as of whenever the public count was last updated
16,318,782
oh hey alan walker is in top 100
wack
when i first watched they had 200k subs

i still don’t get why they are a thing
rc have you even _seen_ this guy's content
bella they dont even have guns they arent the smartest folk
you take one to solstheim or however you spell it
i love the 18th century
the one easiest to remember thats non dlc is the one with one of the guilds
oh yeah in dark brotherhood questline you murder the emperor while hes on his ship
yeah but how was i supposed to know that
but like how dont they have guns in skyrim
gouda?
thank you
wow they have analytics from the 20s?
league is a lot more popular internationally
sweden is a myth
of course interest in memes increase over the years
great, now i'm tempted to watch crash course videos for the rest of the night
`how not to set your pizza on fire: crash course engineering #15`
dragonite: 1; dragonite: 0
no notifications except for the guy who i'm trying very hard to avoid
ahoy
one of these is nto like the others
looks liked he helped in some way
would you rather stick each individual sheet of paper in its own envelope and stick all of the envelopes in one big envelope
damn i want to do that now
thats probably how the fcc feels about public comments tho too
virginia tech? yeah they sent me recruiting information well into my twenties also
master know anyone who hates receiving letters?
fortunately i signed up for their email nonsense under an account that i lost the password to so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
is it worth unveiling them?
also my nose runs
and saw some stuff
indeed.  welcome to our little slice of discord.
my class is at noon
thats almost an improvement!
my first class gives quizzes exactly at the start.. it sucks
glad to see everyone doing well
oh i forgot that i blocked mee6
take the easy option in this case
i love this
get the dynamite
they both are bad
anyone remember those nascar shopping carts at home depot
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
those carts would make 5 year old me so excited
another essay due in english already <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
that sounds cruel and unusual
oh yeah and we had a mini argumentative piece in gov that most people wrote over a page for. i wrote half a page talking out of my ass and got 6/6 on it
this whole mornings real odd
i didnt have that much work, or as much work as i usually have, and my house wasnt freezingly cold like it usually is, and we actually have food to snack on
same for me
wow i made it
no thanks i just ate two slices of terrible pizza
so my three hour class let out after 45 minutes, i went to eat terrible pizza, and now my next class doesnt start until two hours from now
sounds good
bella want some terrible pizza? the school cafeteria has more of it than they know what to do with
it's cold therefore it's christmas
vote'); drop table candidates --;
i remember we got papers or something about it in high school but i never read them
maybe if you throw it fast enough you can knock out the power cord or something
then again
>implying there's anything else to talk about
hey theres plenty other things to talk about
exactly
computers cant be science theyre made of rocks and we already know about rocks
very badly
is the new 3ds worth?
for a certain time
but then it starts becoming unpredictable
the game of life is the ones where the squares reproduce and kill each other
ida battle drago pls and destroy him!
probably
for example, when asked whether dragonite should fork the doom 3 code, he is probably not going to use it but he probably also doesnt care so he's probably going to do it anyway
i wanted to model langton's ant a while ago but was too lazy
with or without the viking swords
me good at wasting ti.e guys
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
i did a really good typo earlier
even older
wanna learn history?
and there are no paper cartridges
easy to injure them though, so it has some uses
nothing im interested in
but you physically copies are nice for display
video games
humans are nice
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
post with a dog in it -> search by controversial
fun times for all
is this like part of your morning routine or something
holding onto some rhino stuff to. should be good
thats a first of those
gummy im bored wanna battle
*sends dragonite to russia* time to get up
maybe that'll save me from pre-cal homework that i'm not even getting graded on
well i got home at 3
thanks
with online code shopping
its an extra slot for certain frame mods
huh, don’t see it
greetings all those who are kind
thanks
scrub
since invasions are the only way to get those
i haven’t unlocked most of sedna so oh well
i can inv you
and then i remembered there was a communications patch taht i havent updated on yet
i still gotta do it to
all good
take out camera because its kinda funny
yeah
actually i think they all are except access and onenote, and who uses access and onenote
oh and guess who cant sleep again
hello person
brb pretending to be productive today
it's windows
got it
that, i’m excited for
> question 56
i did this problem last night
microsoft office
but if any math nerd can give me their input on that problem #56 *cough* master *cough* spazzer *cough* when you can that'd be great
it’s not surprising, but official
or you could say a= -2/x
i’m afraid blitz has... calculus addiction
but is it differentiable?
me thinks problem is flawed
so the first piece and second piece should have the same derivative value at x = 0
i did this one in like 2 seconds
a friend and i were discussing nintendo's new paid online
makes sense
nah, you should know
i would understand if it was to keep their own servers running though
havent they always had an ass-stick when it comes to online content?
also i'm pretty sure a majority of people make over $41k
it's not about whether you can afford it, it's about what you're getting in return
and quite honestly
my brain is 50% ponies 50% war
gum might get to study overseas
i wasn't complaining, i was just giving my thoughts based on what i've heard
well if the context of the conversation is "hey dont plow our house down"
does it suck? yeah of course it does
you should go to somewhere like antarctica
you arent allowed to touch the penguins
or maybe penguins can study gummyology
or get close to them
it's the study of motion basically
too late doing calc first
is rate my professor a working thing in canadialand
becoming school teacher is harder than it looks
majestic it isnt butter its a butter subsitute
the classes are way tougher than film
gummy what do you _do_ with a film degree anyway
film editor or producer for tv shows before moving on to movies or animation
film majors are a necessity for most crews so they’re useful
though it’s good that teacher’s programs aren’t easy.. literally teaching the next generation lmao
gummy wanna take my writing class for me
community moreso when you wanna transfer... those reqs are no joke
hmm, don’t know. i’m sure the boomers will complain about them too so we’ll find out
i already am complaining about college
just saying personally, but the 4 years are a literal 4 commitment so it’s the same thing
i don’t know how i passed stats
that’s awesome
those are _all_ true and false
ring theory is that if something is round and goes on a finger its probably a ring
final*
fuckin sat there doing nothing for two whole hours
i took chem as a senior
i started taking ap chem as a sophomore but then dropped it because i was barely even going to class
i think the highest for freshman here is bio
actually did good
i mean people in grade 12
im in such a good mood
and most people after 12
no...i think ida was the one hat said she would create a game a something for it
well that’s easy
oh gummy _is_ the detention teacher
i'm as generic as they come
i’ll remind her
you could teach the procrastination class on the days that i dont show up
i should probably tag him hun
ok enough of being a huge nurd, time to do dog chores brb again
it's so cool and easy too
as long as you're careful, rock and roll
also i apparently have no role in that sheet
except that you have to do it like sixteen times to get a result
i was going to say
is that a good thing or a bad thing
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
it’s normal probably
you have no valid point
i'm watching re:zeri
because i do the dumb
a high male voice in choir
ida are you implying that you sleep well _normally?_
ida here the news?
well, have fun
talking to eyan, will be on eventually
or maybe someday you could be a history prof
transfer?
should have learnt french instead
was that because you didnt speak english or because you answered "musket" for every question
i got chewed out in first grade
oh i hate teachers
i have poems to read. hopefully
@someone else, set it up to ping me whenever someone says gay
ccongrats
got pinged twice
i still think nintendo should have their own site/system like loveroms and emuparadise with netflix style payments or something to play older games
leave'er johnny leaver ohh leaver johnny leavr. for the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
i wanna be a teacher so i hate myself
and it's time for us to leave her
a special fuck you to the guy who looked right at me while i was downed vs the gustrag three in a nitain mission and didn't revive me
oh look it's ten pm and ive done nothing useful today
<:rooayaya:486235340131139603> i hope you enjoy everything that's not subaru <:rooayaya:486235340131139603>
~~always bring plasmor~~
felix is hot tbh
legitimate question: what's wrong with using a ternary operator?
goof off in the computer lab by making a program to dispense random calvin and hobbes quotes when called.
you could give it all to me
it's 2 am here
you have no clue what i want do you?
so is paint
ahh, freshmen
the yellow part not the 0.7k part
the ones with the really fuckin annoying names
gummy you know you can just use an elgato for that right
what type of drug are you one
ive seen it
no im flubs
whats an fhat
then i don’t have any suggestions
then let me go play minecraft in peace damn it
how is that stupid?
a new game called war of rights
melee riven from my sorties

...  i think i just spent a half hour looking at a fish
someone needed a lex prime reciever
i rolled for it like 20 times
see i told ya capitalism is good
the more the researches cost
cause i still need that
almost all research is done, shadow clan
thanks
yeah. didn’t know that actually
also this is happening
none of that matters why the fuck would you put that in your resume to literally everything
ida let me introduce you to these things called "the biggest pages on facebook"
jupiter
me and my big mouth
3450 i think
>implying facebook meme pages don't steal from reddit too
but reddit steals from 4chan and twitter and twitter steals from reddit. and we all know to stay far far away from 4chan so where is the purest meme source?
let the chaos begin in three, two, one . . .
not in a hurry but yes
rip i returned to stream gone
rise up stormcloaks
sitting is comfortable and rising is hard
if it was easy everyone would do it
[crickets]
im retiring as of 5 hours ago

i just find the last part hilarious
wifi located
super metroid's?
unity's z fighting solution is reeeeeaaaaaally baaaaaaaaaaad
i like it when my code is a metaphor for my entire life
you can do that in real life too
"and here we have dragonite getting his eleventh hour of sleep"
here we see the dragonite taking a half hour to get out of bed as he continues to fiddle around with his metal spaghetti dinner from last year
also is it bad that nintendo sent me an email about a pokémon distribution and the pokémon in the picture was completely unrecognizable
the large one
what is it
so like
thats the boy
good job
snorlax
oh, so he's too busy getting x to divide by zero to get y
the forecast calls for an undefiend chance of dragonite showing up to stream tonight
okay so that didnt go well
yeah, i should've known that joke would fall flat
actually it's from the enlightened# channel
the who?
we just have the tallest house on the block

1. [magnavox]
4. snes
2. [2600]
5. n64
9. switch
6. gcn
now i gotta figure out what those first two are
thats more like an arcade game than a console
and why call it 2600 and not atari?
7. wii

there was a gaming crash?
it was basically the result of a severe lack of quality control back then

how in the hell do i start learning programming
then you cry in the corner and question your life choices
you go on the google and look up snakes. they teach you codes
not doing any classes on it

my friggin college calculus course is easier than my high school honors course
"here's a template lab that someone turned in in 2007, just copy and paste some words and add a table of your results and write me two sentences for why your results don't match mine and you get a 95"
the great thing about physics is that you don't need words for it to make sense
got to love it when teachers expect you to do homework they never announced
the directions are equal to "ok go and do it have fun!"
yeah that's pretty much what's in all of the lab files i still have lmao
like spaghetti or people
my favorite part is when you catch the black hole at just the right angle and you can see an image of yourself without needing a mirror
also what the fuck how do teachers have enough time to grade all this stuff and still make tests and shit
alright cool
oh and i got another essay in english due

nerds

i don't know any demon lord
my name is better
this is an insult to gummy

i could get things done or i could play skyrim
i hate this so much
well i am happy for some reason
while idk my relationship status with my gf i can safely confirm ida is the older sister i always wanted
~~well ida is ugly~~
older sisters are hot in anime

jk jk
you can have my little sister
okay no wonder my peanut butter is wet
but i also looked up to him so that was nice
october in canada
i realize something
>: (
and the ones for linux are . . . entertaining
i still have to redo the entire physics essay too <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
for now
it's always supposed to be raining somewhere
other than that they expect me to find out really specific details that only websites like yahoo answers or quora seem to know
i could not find a single answer
ask them to double check that they didn't give you ap astronomy homework
then at the end they had me describe two proposed methods of interstellar travel, and talk about the concept of warp drive which was probably honestly the easiest part becuase a lot of websites actually agreed ont he information
i could not agree more
coffee sucks <:kappa:374346980136058893>

however sucking is produced by a generated difference in pressure by removing matter from an area, causing pressure on other sides to push matter toward the vacuum
and dragonite forgetting i have a 12 year old sister

women make two part pendulums look like orderly systems

not as important as good ol' reyn time

idk to me that seems similar to posting "just got into my 24th hit and run this week #vroom" on facebook and then being upset when you get arrested
it is friday october fifth gummy
because it would get them in deep shit
how does breaking a table relate though
you're hopeless.
if you accidentally broke a table because you didn't know that would happen if you swing an axe on it, that's something you had control of

from the white house: a useless and/or redundant alert
vsauce! dan here
i can't grow anything above my chin
oh look my xbox controller was just under my desk thats convenient
yeah but that requires me going to mcdonalds
my hair is purple
thanks, it’s thematic and wonderful
and don’t say go to the dentist
fucking hell
i gotta floss
solution: get rid of all the teeth
you can put your hamburgers and stuff in the blender
your body clearly hates it
at least i think that's the case, i don't know. i'm not a dentist or an orthodontist
somehow defeats the purpose
i don't know, google's just showing me results of wisdom tooth extraction
i do the bare minimum to have them till i dont need them
purple is weird on you
wild west classic
what is your weapon?
no dragonite is dragonite and gummy is gummy
yeah people tend to leave when dragonite shows up
uninstalling skyrim is illegal
god i have too few dans

drago did
he was legendary figure supposedly living around the 6th century
oh the picture didnt show up
which, i guess, makes sense

after this excavatino
donezo
zzzzzzzz
i feel like playing video games what should i play

my favorite
my lit class assigned so much reading <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
wow the sergeant is actually a joke
such a joke that you forgot he existed
i need nova sys from raptors
yeah, teach us stuff we're going to need. not "the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell"
yeah
you put all your info on a google doc and share it with the corporate email. the entire email
also a lot of the point of school is broadening your horizons and also teaching you to not be an asshole. it fails on both fronts, but you cant really fault them for trying
you need that
well knowing them yes, paying for them, no
can you use a microwave?
all the while english is one of the most useless degrees that it's possible to get
it turns out my last brain cell didn't die.
remember all those ayatan treasures you sold
i dissolved a bunch and that barely did anything
probably in a coma and on life support
i don’t even know what you’re talking about
"this pill will cure your cold but it may cause bruising bleeding vomiting diarrhea and death"
it helps over time, trust me
tsm will win worlds...oh wait
i couldn’t get into it today
howdy fellow friends
bored right off the bat?
yeet

it's also a few days after my finals for calc and stat
oop just got called down for dinner
mirage and a pyrana are broken
bored right off the bat. i think i’ve just played too much lately, it happens
the best way to fix burnout is to force yourself to keep playing until you hate the game forever
i found something on an old hard drive
mark my words 100t will make it out of groups over fnatic
all it required was hating my favorite thing for 2 years
because smash
hope you have lots of fun
finished the calc assignment and submitted, whats up guys
i believe
its ok we still love you
nice
and then he died 
**the end**

youre a robot right tyou should be good at this
and i still dont know what im doing
blame ash
i have a really bad idea hang on
everyone?
there's the broken wikipedia thing
help im back to stardew
skyrim says hi
e!github
esp group c
because soaz
hmmm
one day. but there’s more important stuff that always comes up
i wonder if i can ping a channel with `<@#num>`
like what
college monstrosities.
like uesp for when the power goes out
not always lucky to have pdfs
my dog just pushed her food bowl around the floor and when i put food in it she looked at me like "why did you give me this"
mine just scratches at you till you do what he wants
eggnog is so good
eggnog is so good
i smacked that fucker at full speed
just cleaned the basement for 2 hours
just a nice, calm, uncontrolled burn

i woke up late
85% feels mild, i shouldve gone for the 90% cocoa
dude khan academy quizzes are amazing
you heard right
yeah because this room is packed and i take up a lot of room
samson is who flubs is referring to.
hello hello i think i’ve got a migraine
which is unusual. don’t get those often
yeah, tried to hold out on not taking anything but it won lol
*kicks dragonite into the stratosphere* goaaaaallll
yummy
great, now i’m hungry
why are you kicking gummy into the stratosphere
have any idea?
he doesn’t
where are the words and/or characters missing in the document?
though honestly, haven’t come across that problem
i'd suggest just throwing it on google drive
openoffice might not support the formatting used for the `dx/dt` and such.  i forget where exactly it is in word, but i can see that as something that isn't easy to translate over to openoffice/libreoffice.
okay, this is going to sound weird but hear me out.
this is an omen
if you dont take him offline he will find another of his kind and reproduce
so would that mean like all of his 2869 lines of spaghetti get randomly recombined with someone else's 2869 lines of spaghetti or something
we're fucked
for example, if you teach a computer to read twitter, it'll become a xenophobic misogynist
\:thinking\:
not yet
whats the most outer space sounding song in skyrim
yeah that sounds like a biology teacher
is it about skyrim
you need a permit until 18 or passed drived
i threw a stapler at the receptionist last week
tbh she deserved it so im not at fault
i dotn even know any of the terminology in chess
its the friend you play with
i know none of em
i have like
3/16 of a chess system in unity
teachers dont check hw
i have pics if you need
btw master i told you i got docked points for using the ternary operator right
e!wolfram ternary operator
aaaaaa
i basically soloed hek while the other person was dicking around at the beginning of the map
thanks windows
where can you download that
i sacared someone into thinking i was givin them malewar by going on there
no its safe
i saw someone post it on twitter a week or so ago but i have no idea what to search for it
one more hour till thanksgiving
thanksgiving is probably my least favorite holiday
damn
now you just need that at double speed so the player doesnt fall asleep
consider it a rebellion against the smartphone era
yeah let's not
balls i need to go to class
when your computer freezes and theres nothing in the event log about it
the stuff in it is kind of important but the words inside it are like
ironic as they want to reduce language as much as possible in there
if that does not scream "dick with me to see what happens" i dont know what does
i wonder if adding copypasta to tech support tickets and then ignoring the replies on their site is also part of windows policy
whats with your pc?
did you get the windows update?
also not putting ig first in d lul
it probably has something to do with an unknown component near the back-lower-right of the computer tower spitting sparks at me the other day
and both splits ig was able to put up a fight vs rng
idk if this should be here or memes but lo;
today im even more happier
they now legally have to unban you
great ida
gummy when did google shut you down
that pinged me
dangit phone
i will
i just have those correct button things on my phone
but now it will be gone
when i sub botted?
hey i know what i should do
and see if that subbot website still worls
it would probably be a 5 second video on something
i really wanna go in the other room but dog
there is a difference between your harvest moon and jurassic park
i didnt play harvest moon
but he wants to gamble flubs
yeah but hes sleeping in my lap
harvest december
but im at a weird angle
itd be all jolty and hed wake up
but i dunno where she is
even chuggaaconroy gets busy
and you fucking *pay* to be busy
that usually holds me over for the rest of the month
only 1-2 hours of drinking pure alcohol constantly? lightweight.
that’s what i usually do ida
by the way did you know how the police look at you if you use any form of identification other than a driver's license?
you mean there are people who _dont_ show their passport when asked for id
yay windows
sorry to hear that
and if you continue youll be inclined to waste even _more_ of your time
so you say youtube videos are fun while streaming is a waste of time while ida says youtube videos are a waste of time but streaming is fun
rip ida
if you want to be a full time streamer prepare to literally never have more than one or two days off
master do you even know the words to ragnar the red
but if youre a full time streamer you get to complain about losing the population of a town because you didnt go live over the weekend but only think of it as a minor setback
also you can't argue with your viewers
that depends on the streamer
actually a lot of siege streamers dont put up with people being douches in chat and i find it really funny
kix once banned someone for copy pasting a question over and over until someone answered. it was great
since if you just ban every person who insults you you're going to have no viewers left
i stream because im bored
he doesnt ban them for insulting him, he bans them for being annoying
twitch chat has one skill and it's relentlessly insulting people
yeah i agree
when did 4chan buy twitch
4chan's skill is plague doctor stories
i just need 15 more followers and that 3 average views
i don’t even know why i would want it tbh
also a lot of siege streamers employ mob justice which i just love. if maciejay wants to ban someone for something petty he'll open it to chat. i dont think theyve ever survived mob justice
well thats incorrect
people are sleeping on ig tbh
was i guess
funny dog
baba yetu is cool
you told me to listen to baba yetu
so i did
good
and saw muskets in it
good
(╯°д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \\)
i wanna record stuff but i'm still not convinced that my computer won't just turn off on me for no reason
i tried recording a bit of stuff, but it wouldn’t import into premiere; it said “this file is missing audio or video *something*”
good job squid
it was on history and napoleon
hmmm
right in the middle with the quests.
in xenoblade theyre all like "oh i like pie, go get me fifty pies"
~~more reason to not like xc~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>
honestly, watching an lp of it, i do like some of the story and character stuff. but, i’m still not going to play it myself
well, not having much of a warning with spike attacks are a bit of an issue
i did a loan thing
damn even gummy has more money than i do
but gf had an unexpected bill
no because i dont expect this back
do you want to tell him or
i mean he does get usage of a twitch emote in return for subbing
it's my gf flubs
ok sure
so gummy why couldnt she afford whatever the fuck
if she doesn't pay me back you can tell me i told you so
i guess we will see what happens in the future
question: what is a broiler bill
darn
acrobat reader can die in a fire
i have to read thoreau and all he's doing is contradicting himself
i guess he wasnt very thoreau when it came to getting his point across
youre right im not sorry im flubs
goddannit, you
god i hate myself. theres no turning it off
good
keep being you
im sorry
its correct.. but at what cost
c9 c9 c9
just code triple battles and then copy paste it but subtract 1
or maybe pokémon battle royale
especially the bad ones. there arent good battle royales.
i don't remember what it is but i know i played it before 14 days of shitstorm
and bella let me know once you watch
the fuck man
it's only like 95% broken
even if my pickems don't reflect that.
ignore that big bad statement
because currently im going with drinking over eating because i care about my body on the outside only
on the outside
yeah but less than eating so i go  with that one
and not to the extent that i cant out exercise it
had a customer that was a pain to deal with; pretty sure he was high. i could tell from his eyes and that he gave off strong fumes that smelled like spray paint that made a couple of us not feel well. and he came through 3-4 times.
drago
you are a moth cricket
join so i can make fun of you

then we are safe
viagra, aka primed continuity
there’s a guy next to me watching prequel meme videos
nice
i’m so glad there’s no quiz on thoreau.. so i didn’t totally waste my time reading 50+ pages. that would’ve sucked
good afternoon
that’s not a genre
are you kidding me?!
not even close.
"walfas" is the name of that art style.
so isn’t amaratsu a dog or a fox?
amaterasu is the goddess of the sun, taking the form of a wolf.
i probably killed the spelling. my apologies
i had a strange feeling you were gonna be easy to get along with
so i need to understand that others do the exact same thing.
i’m going to give you my honest opinions on whatever the subject is. that’s just me. so i hope that doesn’t interfere in future convos that we may have in the future
do keep in mind there's a difference between stating honest opinions, and stating them in a blunt fashion.
i’m honest
sound reasonable to me.
so now that we got that squared away. are you into makoto shinkai movies?
youtube is my primary source of entertainment.
only if you want no ads and offline viewing on the mobile app, but there are gif cards that are only sold at best buy and gamestop if you don’t wanna use a credit card
gift*
you mean they pricing?
no, as in how frequently do the ads show up.
it’s form the creators of crunchyroll
didn't know that.
do you see it?
yup.
i used love that show. even the opening song
do you remember duel masters?
on cn
i remember i caught half of one episode and never saw it again.
i watched pokemon and that's it
i never played a kh game; i don’t know, it just doesn’t look interesting to me
i hate those letters too <:kappa:374346980136058893>
especially his that’s what she said jokes
oi vey
i can miss obvious jokes sometiemes.
if i see someone rob an apple store does that make me an iwittness?
he's just such a kind, genuine guy
i could tell
i feel like emile is going for the wr of most streetpasses
well he does have a lot of 3dses.
master i dont suppose you would know how to algorithmically figure out if a board setup is a checkmate in less than like n^6 time
i could be googleing this but wheres the fun in tjat
fraid not
i really wanna do it
im here
kinda
brad and i are coordinating carol of the bells cover
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
one*
ah ok
stuff ice in those clothes
ooh yay
youtube has given me yet more tools to help quantify how my channel is failing
oh so it also turns out that these new tools are somewhere between nonfunctional and hopelessly broken
yeah, that sounds like youtube tools
lps?
hes got like 2 million subs
plus or minus the global human population
hey is it possible to have a playlists on yt and have different playlists inside that playlist?
nope
ive never applied online but ive only ever applied to one job and that ended pretty poorly because i got the job
it will be organization for yt
good organization
congrats flubs
brb kicking self off phone
did you make a resume flubs?
it was 4 years ago idfk
sometimes i think my gf is the only one that makes me happy
god is
im bored
geeks
creeps
and babies
are there babies in here?
class is only an hour and a half long but i don’t wanna go
sadly
i'm sleepy
mmm, how so
or just between us workers
oh haha sorry i mean in general.
bc like when people speak to me and i’m not like prepared enough i get clumsier
i would go on more but class is starting
i want whoever told me that fired
when did you apply
what did you guys blow up today?
you ran—oh that dragonite
oh right
my resume is literally a text file with four-space tabs thats a good way to get a job right
ddmmyyyy is little endian
no the others are stupid because why should i change the way i write the date
how is month first stupid
i typically always see/write month first
who the fuck makes long term investments
i’m surprised year first is actually a thing
it is in canada
base twelve would be awesome
i mean whats the point of life if you dont get to invoke a little society-sized catastrophe now and again
do i ask what that is
they were sitting around 32-33 dollars a share a few weeks ago now theyre at like
oh also they make like computer guts and stuff
yeah
also theres nothing illegal about *wanting* to pour boiling hot water down someones throat
its the execution that gets you in trouble
just dont its the easiest option
what is the work
just so yall know im aqua
i should probably set my pfp to spooky ougi
and i mean im bad with people
you aren’t
not bad
i hate it there
cccccccccccccccc
oh he did, well that's good
is that good or bad
today i am gonna destroy something
or maybe it isnt
maybe it's a toy car
octopuses
octopie
bella youre an octopie
very kind of you
it's an acquired skill
so we just played against trick2g
me_irl
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
i'm genuinely curious what she would think in different scenarios
granted i could probably just ask her
yeah, it's the one that melts your face off
<:gwomoraphiohmy:405784196783538196>
let's hope not
twilight princess link - - in ocarina of time! ^^^^^^^
boys in blue did it
1-1 against each other
i want gen and afreeca out of groups
like i think that game should have been rated r
well friends, i feel like you ought to know
fight me
travel time says no
well shit there goes like half of my opinions
now we're asking the real questions
something something "being right for the wrong reason"
true
i shall be spending my weekend watching these vods
got damn it
why do people out smart me?
lul, how are the peoples of zeal today
benny ate it while gummy was watching him
con: youre a villain so you had to kill it
truly committed to the nickname
he is currently biting my pencil
i’ll also take some pizza, thank you
could go for some more pizza tho
i like integrals and pizza
speaking of newton
proofs and theorem derivations are great tho
not keeping this
it's basically an approximation that gets better and better and you can write it out to a greater accuracy than your calc
plus im not positive that newton's method can approximate all points
some points dont converge, but some do
so  after getting x_n+1 you'd use that as x_n on the right side and get a new better x_n+1 and keept hat cycle over and over
im not sure if i aware of that method
like the sixth root of 2 for example
windows wants to update and is giving me the option to do it either now or now
skarm say brb
yay windows
*throws waffle out the squid that was* etc.
dragoknit
why is base12 good?
0.5 obviously
i forget probably
great now i feel like googleing dumb things about base systems and seeing what i get
dont you mean "assymptote"
(that probably wasnt original dont shoot me)
as minimalist as you can make a hyperlink
his name is dan
great reason
how was telling scary stories to your dog?
ask flubs
squid because theyre spooky and it was dark and october
you had an interesting week two months ago
maybe a brush too or something
gf went to nottingham
then it aint the end
drago
you rang
unless you like them and theyre a fucking bitch
go back to sleep
though i play too much ranked these days
hey want me to be your anivia coach?
leason
but other people
or feed
link pls
(the vod session's tomorrow)
i assume you meant follow
following does nothing though
only reason i do it is because i can do this <a:rarityflirting:447509240043667466> or <:raritysmile:447196778517757978>
tbh i never actually care about converting people to bronies just for jokes but i still converted someone
they keep listening to yelly movies
actually the animation is very similar to anime
this reminds me of the time my roommate ate 24 ounces of parmesan cheese in three days
gummy stop smoking keyboards
also is it bad
what is this!
talking to me is great ida
everyone thinks i have a pretending people ever think about me addiction
unless you seem my anger issues
speaking of warlike and destructive, you would make a great fit for eimm
watch
good thing i left that server when i did
kick/ban
kick/ban/kill
and they don’t ban
they talk to them
i usually lurk and don’t care
i have 0 chill and i'll have you know
i'm so lonely
not a public
you just fuckin called me dan
dan gheesling?
so it’s worse now
plus she told me to break up with my gf then told my gf to break up with me
ok good decision
if you join
even though technically mods shouldn’t even be in a friends server
but you probably shouldn't mod me as soon as i join or anything
no do exactly that
of course we don’t always have pony talk but you get the picture
again?
what?
something something lifo data structures
~~i just assume everyone who isn’t here at the time is out actually doing something with their lives~~
my server is dead, two pony servers are too noisy
oh wait my power is back so i can toilet again
go away let me browse reddit
only one?
i said batman and robin > the dark knight
batman and robin > batman and robin
can i make a poem about essays instead
how about
same
you are gross
i love how ida is instantly terrified when she join
in a "what is this generation" way
we all do
you idiot
so which do i want more
coffee can help get rid of the alcohol in your body
google made me understand why i don’t know it
im supposed to get drunk every night
benny likes you sober
who else is gonna take him bowling?
im watching a stream and either the bf is being abusive or its a way of an affection
do you have like some sort of godly alcohol tolerance or something
um 5'7" 115 lbs
yay its midnight and i just spent like two hours trying to figure out why i was getting the wrong output when i was giving the computer the wrong input
flubs!!!
and itso nly 1 am
on top of spaghetti all covered in cheese, i lost my poor meatball when somebody sneezed, it rolled off the table and onto the floor, i lost my poor meatball as it rolled out the door
drago
you are a turtle
best of luck, animal_man\_.
its okay i like cheese enough for both of us
i like mozzarella
but that’s all
<:treason:396483914803445761>
~~=v=~~
cheese is life
oh yeet
i wish
yep i wasnt notified lul
complex problems, complex answers
who's ready for zeal 123.621
there ya go
then we roll them down a hill
way better than "the report card"
as do i
i feel like i've missed a lot
sitting in traffic has its perks
but there are
you haven't missed anything, lol.  i've been biding my time, adjusting to my new job and i'm ready to kick back into the streaming world
we'll always be here for you man
a king isn't a king with out his supporters.
i think im losing my voice
also kugal you like math right
but i believe they are another type of number, in 4 dimensions
and they look like i j k l or soemthing like that, i cant remember
i'd have to re-watch that 3blue1brown vid on em
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
i loaded in late at 2:50, we won at 15
i never looked at the old one
i need a full size version  of it to comprehend
it was this
now its even more zoomed in
what are the orange dots
summer touchup
and it's autumn
autumn leaves silly
that's the full image
i actually like the autumn one a lot
nice, you updated these on stream too then?
granted twitch makes it hard because they always change their damn rules when it comes to how images fall below the stream
i like the spring one the most
you're not wrong
love the new icon 💗
i want to do some housecleaning on this server too, but that's another day's project
again, another day's project
hey guys how long has the server picture been different without me noticing
5 minutes maybe
a week it is then
that last one has been that way for a month now
it's never on it
even if his best if fuckin trash
we'll go with that.
no cupcake for you come to stream
is that the protonjon head with dragonite antennae
my guess would be homestuck or something.
its an anime thing
tatsu reminded me to do my homework
but i do not want to do my homework
they have two prongs instead of just the one
oh look streams still going on i should probably poke my head in there or something
what is ash's worst pokemon battle?
sabrina.
victori in game
because people like money
amazo
can benny be my roommate for this hotel?
i need help paying
my dog has bigger spots on her right side than on her left side
everyone
or the feature request thing or something
why would you bite a live animal. how does that make sense
welp
it's called blue steak
thanks
something about raw eggs
not typically, no, not safe
that's when you block them
kugal ive been in that situation and the person is never fuckin worth it. also they usually dont even learn
he didnt even look at the damn directions on how to complete the assignment
exactly, theyre always annoying self-centered asses
kugal right click on the guy
click the red block button
you should read the directions on how to complete the assignment before taking up 4 hours of your fellow student's time
thats fair
kugal tell him that this is your alt account and point him to me as your main one
i feel like with all the diversity there is on the internet, ,there's bound to be one person who says that seriously
he's been offline for a few hours, so its been pretty peaceful
so when he shows me his screen and what he needs help with, everything is in german
im gonna get too depressed
r value is 1-1e-12
and part of me doesnt want to because i still have to see him in class everyday and i dont want him to give me shit for blocking him
also its probably a lot easier to have adult intervention offline if they see it happening
that works too
with people like this, you don't really have much to lose if you block him
i dont know why but i guess i dont have the heart to block because i feel guilty i guess
agreed
3 day weekend for me
so far i like college a considerable amount more than hs because it's actually full of mature people
thats not dickish at all
the last day of that class was awesome
in college its full of people who are millions times more humble and they're just more real
well, int hat class anyway
in college and beyond everyone still does but you keep it in and try not to make others not hate everything and everyone
the only thing i like/miss from high school is being with the handful of people i actually liked
oh shit that reminds me
for someone
thats dumb
not the one i expected you to pin
ive reached the point where i believe theres some bottomless box of emotes but how do you find the ones you need
yeah remembering an infinite set must be a swell time
or just relevant ones.
for one
ok then i dont which is good
we did it
dern
would you like me to create another dab
<:nay:327308337706434570>
aww, thanks babe

birthday punch!
is that like an off brand falcon punch?
good job now shes gonna kill you and call it a birthday corpse
<:gwqlabsmonkass:393085114403389442>
candy is secondary
master how long has my quote about being a dumbass been pinned
being on their side was never a requirement
can you reviving me faster in league though?
want to learn math?
anyways.
shu todoroki from cars 2
now waht
you should upload pubg
i only upload things i can pronounce
then call it playerunknown's battlegrounds like a fuckin idiot
wheres the fun in that
i create a second array of length (first array length / 2)
wake him up and tell him you want wine
he will get it for you
something something garbage collection
i just finished the second episode of telltales the walking dead’s final season and i’m bummed now
you guys and your spreadsheets rub off on me too much
also archwing launcher is infinite now
cloud 9 bany
im no bandwagoner
he literally drank whisky from the bottle while driving
i love tsm but they tend to not play there own style and play scare hoping they can somehow win late game
okay
people won’t make fun of c9 for getting an “easy” group or skt carrying them out
i went from silver 5 to 2 then back to 3
im watching gordan ramsay cooking steak on a shovel
play both at the same time
also gummy sure we can collab, you can be the punching bag
someone save me
and which one
after halloween
we both dressed up as the scariest thing we can think of
gummy has a terrible imagination then
your costume, however, is remarkable
i just got demoted from silver 4 and my first game after that i go 4/0/21 on braum
i hate things right now *throws squid out of the pumpkin patch*
i wish
also why is the w in my name lower case?
<:lul:305559915714576385>
take flubs i'm innocnet
but i like flubs ill take gummy instead
by all means, kill gummy all you want but i'll still know, and i'd be the winner here
my dog is making funny noises
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
he's rebuilding stream right now
who broke it
how dare you blame me?
its fun
drinking water is fun
i havent done that in like three days
also i have the best drago insult ever
but i can already use fly
shit
you are a boat
im pretty sure i can use hm03 too
fuck
let me look this up
tm94
he would get to battle the fat kid
is that sun and moon or x and y or black and white
sun and moon
sup pals
now i only have 6 courses to worry about
dont mind me ive been sitting here crashing my code for almost five years
r i s e
i've read a few *comics* about that
life’s true mystery
because you can never know for sure if they *arent* poisonous, but if you learn that they are you know
so do some people
the fuck is a district
flubs why is everyone living in the place most vulnerable to hurricanes
its a piece of a state that has a senator
some places overlap too its great
when i was a kid my next door neighbor had a different zip code and phone area code
great now i spent 12 minutes reading about nassau the island instead of finishing homework
its got all the good restaurants in the sound
league of legends but you jump upwards the whole time?
oh cool apparently the sound had d+ water ecosystem health when i was a kid
master my code isnt working help
would be interesting to have an item with a tooltip comment of all the people who actually did someting incredibly against the odds like get perfect pickems
use your magic to cancel my classes too
greetings, bellas.
figured i should mention today's my birthday.
happy birthday!!
greetings.
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
happy womb escape day
definitely not one of us
or rainy
no you could have tell it was him
lets blame it on eyan
gummy i am disgusted at the implication
how much man card debt is he in rn?
thermodynamics in gases?
thankfully not
but any sane person would tell you that when you're paying five figures to enroll, you'd damn well better be getting more out of it than something you could do on the internet for free
which is the long way of saying "read the books yourself" is bollocks
nice
if i’m teaching myself why do i even go here
wonder if they could rally together in name of my sad sad grade
i half-ass both
it was way different from my high school
i want to understand things i don't understand, but then i would understand why people are dumb. but then again that's self explanatory. screw that
im not sure if i just complimented you or insulted you
if anything im most flattered that anyone thinks about me at all, <:lul:305559915714576385>
open it
and then make the boxes into a *larger* box
~~yeah, just ignore that last message of mine~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>
well gee sorry im having christmas early <:kappa:374346980136058893>
thats ok i got 11 left lul
that includes pens, pencils, pencil lead, a notebook, some note flags, and i got 2 things that werent school related
just join him and he'll eventually stop
i get to be lazy today
i had no school today yet i still did some school work
ive only written 300 or so lines of code today
four little slices of salami rolled up with enough horseradish inside to make me not hungry
thinkinator always helps
gummy wanna write my code for me
gummy if i went to bronycon i might only come out on my way to the coroner
is it hard to use a keyboard with panda hands though
sorta
like this time i literally need protection
also gummy ill be your bodyguard if i get to wear dark sunglasses and an im with stupid shirt
god what the fuck why do people always say put ice on bruises and shit
this doesnt help it hinders at best
then how would anyone know
according to healthline.com, cooling the blood vessels can reduce the amount of blood that leaks into the surrounding tissue, which can prevent the bruise from being as apparent and reduce swelling.
doesnt change the fact that i faceplanted into a fucking staircase on my way to work does it
ice is bs i say we revoke all ice funding and run their business into the ground
is that a politics joke
you go ahead, i'm just going to save ice complaints for winter anyway
you have many choices in your play-style and character customization but i always stick with what i’m comfortable with
wats dat?
since i played skyrim
flubs i didnt know you were into thermodynamics
i dont even fucking know what that is
im making a sick 3d model
the law of conservation of momentum is what keeps dragonite's butt in a chair all day
which is ki da like momentum
yeah and also
i learnt yesterday ida edits better than me
draco im reporting you to the humane society
weenies of mega determination
if they can't adapt, they deserve to lose
that's a depressingly accurate way of describing industrial smog
how long should that last before you get worried
that barely helps
how about this
if you even have to ask
just listen to your body,if you pinched a blood vessel by sitting wrong your vision could easily go dark for an extreme amount of time without any repercussions
hours
aight then we good
yeah, human body is weird, freak incidents/outliers should be taken seriously, but not as pure factual indicators
ooh look im rainy im functional
i can handle 3 shots of alcohol before i forget how to spell
<:roosip:399827510776299520>
i just have a compulsion when it comes to those red squiggles
how do you spell the word for "assure" that sounds like garrin-tiid i k ow it has a lot of unnecessary us and as and es
that sounds like an organ
no me
alright tell me now
dragonite pick a language
bai rainy <:roocry:399827523011084298>
i just realized i've watched chugga for ~half my life
what the ufck is esperanto
just because _you_ are infatuated with falling down the stairs doesn't mean everyone has to be
falling down the stairs can be quite beneficial
the dent is because my skull didnt fuse right when i was a baby
my mom is an emoji
lemme check
my head hurts from looking at a screen all day or something im going to go to bed or something
cannot beat legends never die
gummy
it’s hitting 3 degrees where i am
outside probably closer to 3
disappointed but not surprised
huh. the more i like flash’s s5 suit the more i like it
unless 100 thieves make it out which probably not c9 is last hope
my history professor is amazing
i am proffessjonal analist
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
i put on a vr headset once and it was like
yeah it’s a lot to deal with.
but there are some that do a good job about it.
budget cuts for eample.
i just finished the little game thing and immediately had to get out
hello
you'll keep it
but you'll get others as well
that is the question
fair enough
history teacher made a debate room in class
i went in and said "pineapples dont have sleeves, change my mind"
what does sleeve mean in this context
people got even more confused
today i learn you don’t get 6 tattoos of the person you love and that you shouldn’t propose after one month of datig
also flubs good news
everything seems good
ariana grande = psycho bitch
i thought she was one of the normal-ish ones
im surprise ida knows who that is
me and her made a rule
could you wait like 20 years to move in with each other first then
don’t you wanna come to the wedding?
stupid traditions
i hate them
its in the name though
hey i seen extreme cheapskate before
like there's so many other things you can use that money for
do you want to be married?
but dual wielded
can i get a milkshake licenese?
so yes you can
screw call of duty
i mean i was excited for the br mode but its fucking boilerplate at best
there is nothing innovative or new about it. i might as well play a less buggy, lower netcode pubg with powerups
and they have a low level of entry but high skill ceiling
nah we've been slow today
im decent
i don’t know any decent person <:kappa:374346980136058893>
vortex is dead
maybe i should lol
but my social life been boomin recently and i just dont have much chill time anymore
also recently got a song of mine on a channel with 35k subs so thats pretty dope
and i was on a podcast with a guy who has 60k subs. not sure how many people watched it; he doesn’t get many people watching his videos anymore
putting 10 on any intern
return my vision and you can have one
which im immune to
well your vision is already back if you're typing this <:rooderp:399827526744014848>
and theyre hazy as fuck even with my glasses on
nobody at work knows tho
my hand hurts and i dunno hwy
also it supports out skyrim supports voiced languages like polish and japanese and stuff. i should set my language to that and see if i can still understand anything.
and seeing as i added fifty of them to the player home . . .
<:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
i'm alive
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
it could potentially be c9 vs fnc in semis
did you just fucking diss exercising in the cold
i didnt diss it
-10 what
kelvin
stick an ie in there somewhere
never go stormrazor its shit on her
just as an outline
youd think there was a bunch of dust in there or something but there isnt
today was interesting
yep, that's how uni is
i got no points for group c
oh wait ida did i tell you i got that one day job selling flowers?
dang this guy brought an extension cord, his charger,his laptop, a full on separate keyboard and a wireless xbox controller to campus. that is not light
though impressive
wait i heard keyboard
i have never seen this game in my life so i don’t want to ask what it is
and there’s videos on the side on his phone he’s not even watching
tbh i haven’t seen any college kid smoke
i believe in the boys in blue
i believe in fnatic
oh well fnatic is from eu
who dropped the blue food coloring in your toilet?
the plumber might have gotten sick
using game score is a bit silly
mad shit the bed
but edg seems stronger than c9
don't believe in kt if you want them to win
well i want c9 to win
its not
oh god, there’s a chance for snow a little north from here 😑
jensen is still one of the best western mids
am i jealous or envious
that answers nothing
ninja or samurai?
~~you want to be that twitch streamer?~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>
exception being lot s3
im just...?
im still assuming nga is roy
comic book plotline?
i saw the previews and i am very ready for it
very slight but very much liked
i need to study for my midterm...
huh. that worked opposite the intention, thanks
the fuck is a syllabus?
it makes the class less boring
theeen thats youre fault (:
whatever, its your money
5 mins before exam
its not my money as well
it’s my parents
i want you to be super hard on me
like super super hard
not like that master...
you should get caught up on storyline
you know is it bad that im still not done my essay due last monday
get to it then
you know that won’t work this time
so, thisll be fun
i have to remember how to classify plants that i was totally listening to last week
yeah
guys i think i hate xml.
i think so
when does supper happen then
i knew it
she likes pokemon
and marvel
aint that swell
and flubs you would not like this person
gummy is that how you go around meeting new people
"hello my name is gummy, do you like the emoji movie?"
ask for shows
probably not
now just gotta find an irl flubs
then my life is complete
whatever you are but in irl
im not even sure what i am
hates subway
you can do that
i don’t remember if i even registered to vote
what's this about my toaster
schools overcharge, hooray
i can get a slice of pizza at school for 2.65 but it doesnt taste very good
i don’t want to say specifically for spoilers but oh my god
she dies
why would that be exciting for me lol
there’s only a couple shows where that’s ok
just say potatoes for gummy and theyll know
its a special arrangement of only the finest ~~volatile death orbs~~ vitamin rich frenchless unfrieds
you should go look at it youll be even more disappointed in me than before
master.relations.dragonite.disappointment = (lim x -> 0 -1/(xx))
im back with potatoes
gimme the potoat
potoat
dont bully me ill tell mom
dang
well yeah. its cod. thats to be expected. shitty, but expected
so far your friend’s not bad
errr nooo
fight my enemies yes
also bella dare i ask why you said "burgers," plural?
it’s not good to have lol
i’ve already probably had way too much sugar... may opt out on the soda
considering i don’t think you’ve had this chain before i’d be ok with that
it’s my go to if i decide to have one. i don’t had fast food in a bit
thanks
hey kugal what's the fastest way you know of to determine if the square root of an integer is an integer (i.e. is the number a perfect square)?
(this is totally not based off of a stackoverflow question i saw a little while ago)
i’m an east coast boi because i live here and don’t travel
but it has magfest so it's all okay
i'm right on the edge basically
i haven’t even seen 2/3 of my own state <:lul:305559915714576385>
that's because california is weird
that it is
burgers for dinner is good
eat what i eat, 18th century soldier food
how sweet
dragonite you're always playing skyrim even when you're not
even if you don't want to
what do you even have left in skyrim?
god damn it if i fall in love with her my gf would kill me
and if i flirt with her punch me hard
gummy how could you
yes you are
....
time stops love
but still there are differences
drago likes everything i like
flubs hates everything
you 3 all hate everything
ultimate power move. it shows you think less of her than she thinks of you, that you definitely saw the gift, and dont care about her gift or need the balls
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
flubs
hmm i dont feel like working on game but i dont feel like nto working on game help
flubs ruin my day pls
your dog is dead
i need like 3-4 of those
time to buy prime junk
first and only day for my new job and i crushed my knees getting there
did it feel like you knew what you were doing?
or did you feel like batman?
instead of saying like 6200 ft² per second i accidentally said in my head 6200 ft / s² and thought that was ok
but the littlest part of me is expecting like 13/20 or something
we're only  touching a tiny bit on integration but im like amazing at integration, so that's little worry to me
since we're still in q1 here
like... december 10th ish
damn
because i dont fully understand them
this job is boring
and don’t tell me i just started about 18 minutes ago
only robot here is drago
no cussing young man
go to your room
alright i got the two most important ones
oh wait vulkar wraith is
gummy go to flubs room
do i do my homework
im honestly thinking about it
i do not insist
no job does not consist mainly of doing nothing. just look busy and you wont get more work
and make that annoying dragon that spawns by the college turn into a pile of living chickens on death
that and now im really scared i might fall in love with my new friend
wanna hear a joke?
my love life
hmm there's one section where one of the graybeards uses a gendered pronoun when talking about the player character, i wonder if they correctly change it if you play as a girl or if they just assume nobody would notice
god damn it punch me flubs
no just like both of them
i didnt say marry both
i just realized the ck logo and bethesda logo are basically the same thing
as a general rule if your message was successfully submitted to a server and it later disappears, the solution is not "post it again"
gummy youre officially looking for trouble and i'm hereby granting permission to interpret everything that you say as a rumination on cheese
after getting 4 fucking systems in a row
looks like the only boss frames i need now are mesa, atlas, and nekros
aight
im not looking for trouble
i don’t want it to work like that
especially with our bodies
i feel like im cheating
usually, though
how bout to my stream instead
i took a detour to the university
i just thought they were both spelled the same
it was like after 40 mins in before 48
i kind of think the monocle could go tho
ooh looks cool
i can kinda see that
this bus is actually so loud that i can’t hear that
i might be able to, but not quite right now
sorry
i think i still used my lato at the time
i pretty much just used the default stuff
i was using lex prime
market
hello there
join gummy in this week college adventure
and 4 of those papers you have to write 3-4 drafts including the final draft so rip lol
welcome
guys i think skyrim is a singularity
i guess i should think about doing something with my life now huh
so it's suddenly 3:30 am, which is weird
greetings, squid.
well from my perspective, a full time job may help since it's more consistent in terms of hours.  though i'm not certain.
i already have too many large games to get through as it stands.
i fell asleep at 6 last night
i slept for 14 hours but woke up early
i couldn’t stay asleep for that long unless you killed me
i just got done playing skyrim 15 minutes ago
what does that mean
and you don’t have it on your switch or pager or rock
whenever i press a on a door nothing happens
they can win worlds
there's not only just one first seed left after quarterfinals
at most
if fnatic wins
g2 was weaker
fnc said c9 looks stronger than afs
but i don't think they have a huge advantage
if they have anything cheesy prepared
afs probably knows about it
because they don’t want af to see
since
play skyrim
i have become crazy
just return it
you’ve been crazy
i really really want to play skyrim
well
so basically if i do end up with this new girl she is cool that we breakup
bluej
what did you expect with a name like bluej
since im in a good mood
that's $50,000 an hour and you've been here for at least thirty seconds
gummy benny doesnt leave rooms
maybe a shiba
im going to go pet my dog brb
dragonite what flavor of dog do you have
wanna see?
why is code so haaaaaaaaard
because some aspects of programming are more complex than rocket science.
i kind of want to know what would happen if you set up a battle with like five hundred participants using my code
theoretically it would still work, you would just wish it didn't because the game would be so not fun
next question
whats the context
good i want to make one now
most bittersweet shit ever lmao
like it being really good?
idk if it is that then sure
anyone who doesn't already have octavia parts feel like running some derelict survival
im in
20 or 40?
k back
welp there goes 10k focus
asking for a friend
high key ableist but i feel you
ya'll need more zeal weekly in your lives
ooh spicy
rip zeal wheel: he had a short life
ok mr freeze
wow master chill out
i never really did anything for it 🎉
ida you are the best big sister a gum could have ❤
i can't do it to drago but i forced gummy's
took care of dragon
holy shit the kassadin tilted me so much
pfft this is scarier
spooky
i can’t give up on league when i never played it in the first place <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i would give up on league but eh
i'm sad, the bob ross mod isn't letting me make a robot with the bob ross voice, only normal soldiers
(the thing the kass did was accuse me and my duo of being toxic when we'd barely used the chat and he'd flamed my duo for the entire game)
fucking ask her
also now my name is terrifying
i will have a talk with him
which, to be fair
isn't saying much
52 lp
lolwut
did i miss something
or background checks
as i am a paranoid person
:🇺 ➕ 🇲 🇪 ➡ 🍆
agrewd
wanna play my games but ehhhh
i forget the name of the splash one
can't take away a whole pc <:kappa:374346980136058893>
well ye
but my mom is bad w computers so i'm gokd
that sounds like a lot of work to set up though
also i thought the same thing but guess what? you dont need to be good with computers to throw it out of a third story window
and
"can i pronounce its name?"
i realize something
this is the first time i feel irl love
haha time to make fun of a movie
provolone is pretty good, yes
hey no making fun of dwayne "the rock" "the toothfairy" "the lifeguard" "the adventurer" "the tamer" johnson
he's a legend
nov 24?
i found 36 ds and 45 gameboy advanced/color games in a box of my old stuff
now, i speedrun games ye?
no equipment to record
obs studio for pc. if anything else, you’re screwed <:kappa:374346980136058893>
can't find the account though
so more i go to get
its fine in sandwiches but doesnt work well in ice cream or candy imo
fair enough. its questionable in ice cream for sure
guys i did something really stupid
fuck yeah
i love arthur
good for you both
your grandma's a command prompt
reasons
it’s the stupid booming ones too
are the dodgers in the playoffs or something
or they just won something
yeah the sock thing
im not currently but now i want to know the answer
thanks im going to get a second opinion on that
maybe call them some other words idk
magic
hmm ashbot's profile picture is upside-down ash
okay so uh
i hope it's still on da somewhere
thats probably because i reconnected him
no u
he's not upside down youre upside down
somewhere
they hacking
gross
a really big number like ten to the six
you are arent you
when did it become 10
darn it
fucking
i fucking love licorice
licorice
fuck tsm
not bandwagoning
from the start
na faith
wtf fnatic
ug i wish i could join streams but i have to go to bed at like 7 so i can wake up at 3:30 for work
fnatic is strong but if c9 beats them
g2 took out rng so they're not a lightweight either
oh yea definitely no clear winner
anyone can win
~~now you gotta promise to buy c9 skins if they win worlds~~
i liked my blue
~~aqua is now magma.~~
whos aqua
noooo eu scrub!
they bad?
5/6 finish in summer
that tells me nothing
compared to before yeah they blow
i was summing it up for ida
of course they aren't bad
i rather see them than 100 thieves at worlds
i wonder how long i can avoid being social and work in game today.
one of which won both splits
the other had a very close series that could have gone either way.
and in the end, even though 100t lost that series against tsm, they were overall much more consistent.
meteos was just a big misunderstanding
you be social
rikara did not deserve to go play at worlds at any capacity
they already knew they wouldn't have wom
long term it may be a better move
im hearing aphro wanted meteos kicked and cody sun out
reddit enjoys doing stuff like that
could make sense though
remember what happen to dl on clg
true
as has cody
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
obviously rikara was playing in challenger series for one year and academy for most of this year
you don't know that
fair but rikara didn’t play good as well
they could have let him one game since he worked all year to get them to worlds
sigh it's 2:30 and all ive done is goof off on reddit
i'm not at home rn, gotta do homework later
maybe during stream once it gets rolling
well i think ssumday won't stay
no reason for him to
flubs
its your brother
whos the mother
or you could be neither
i don’t have a brother
well shit, how am i supposed to come up with that money?
don't look away kugal that number will be orders more the second you check back in on it
i have like 3.50 on my desk in loose change that you can borrow
you should probably copy and paste all those as a new e!suggest after getting that important one
oh your other suggestion was total characters sent
i’m back from work ya ninnies. and eyan is streaming
6 runs of derelict survival
gonna do one more run for the night
i just made the "all required move effects do their job" milestone, the question is, do i keep going or do i finally just play skyrim
im leaning towards skyrim
also maple syrup your username is 10/10
