canterlot equestria
owo drago hitting his bad bot with a rod

classmate rolled his truck after drinking and driving

in the newer generations they kinda made red a pushover
coffee drinker
they charge money for use of the mods content.
that's the smell of nature, you fool

the case shouldn't affect your flash drives like that
did i miss something
i don't want there to be too much lag
you already do, ninny
i'm honestly more excited for that time around since i'll be playing gunner xp
that means you swung to attack.
also i came very close to mistyping "weilds ass" which would be a sight to see
why do i have the bad feeling he's going to abuse that emote
when
~~one of us. one of us.~~
i see.
it is
~~dont worry squid, i never will.~~

so before i went to sleep today i figured out the formular to graph a brachistochrone and ive also added 2 new features to the bot
did i just walk in on something here
they let you on phones last year in spare
not true;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
never most likely
archive them somewhere or something
i thought it was fairly obvious :c
ahh starting week count on monday
however if i do choose a new pokemon it will be oricorio
huh?
yeah
i thought it was all in good fun but it was actually meant for me to feel bad
<:treason:396483914803445761>
new super mario bros ds was another option but i done the let‚Äôs play 4 times and it requires the bot screen
‚Äúprick‚Äù
okay then
i didn‚Äôt. although i was feeling slightly more upbeat today
no squid that‚Äôs inappropriate
i mean he's practically banned from this server anyways
what do you guys feel about randomizers
i could have done 1804 or 1815
dragonite, smack him with a frying pan if you please. =w=
that would be funny in real life though. "oh i cant walk because of those 4 swords longer than my arm strapped to my back. forgot about those.
doit
possibly
seen the escape rope fail yet?
you know who was also a good tsar?
also a few milling subscribers and a thriving youtube channel but that's beside the point.

i kind of don't hang out here anymore
sometimes it takes 2 seconds other times its like half an hour

skarm does not want battle revolution
i don‚Äôt like ghestsis.
yup twitch support is on it
skarm sound the drums of war.... japan is going down
the kappa
those
i doubt he meant *those* kind of things, flubs
well i once got my butt kicked when i played on emperor mode in civ
wait a second
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i have no idea what that's supposed to mean
that took years to make
only reason im not aggressive in civ was ida telling it‚Äôs not a good idea
and they started asking me advice
(drago, put an icon on your alt, you lazy bum)
well if he constantly says he‚Äôs 11 and to leave him alone because he‚Äôs young but acts like 11
yay!
why have you been doing that up to now?
i was never a true zealian
botw > skyrim
youre in love with a pony other than whatever that one is called
well im france and france surrender after the napoleonic era

should i set the starting counter to like 2?
ok, who was the queen disguised as in the phantom menace?
i enjoyed my time with it, but not as much as other entries in the series.
what is wrong with me this week?
how so?
skarm knows all
i talk about characters and people i find pretty looking
~~i can play the clarinet~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
is there a good mod to make the guards dialogue slightly more realistic in skyrim? because going from "pst, i know you you are, hail sithis" to "let me guess, somebody stole your sweet roll" to "what is it? dragons?" doesnt seem quite right
they would be the best of friends
you know that website that majestic sent you a while ago?
mo but that has happened
./confuse
an artist must work in the shadows to serve the light

when i started, i didn't know how to screen record
jsut started derivatives and theyre fun
you fit right in here. =w=
the formula was n¬≤ + n - 1
for example on the ti-30s if you type in -1^4 you get -1
but when n = 14 you get 77 which is composite ;/
just the one.
or given my personal rating
assholes need lessons taught to them

idk who to pick though
i could get work done
i think 5-24-25 is also one
yeah but 500 people will be watching...
theyre worth nothing on their own but so much when put into a fucking barrel
you're almost done the game if i'm not mistakne.
theres those junimo huts you can get
and try to get the kegs, theyre worth even more
it's not like the class is experimental
but i guess i should be "stupid" about these things as my parents say
oh grad party will be safe
yeah but if a bunch of passwords leak from a site or something and you use the same one for everything, it doesnt matter how secure it is
it's only once a year that you get to have a go with those hats
and the process of throwing everything at animal man was repeated
because that thing is longer than my entire body and thicker than my forearm
windows 3.1
if i murder you tomorrow that'll be the future instead
we talked about the art of history

i just took the final, my grade isn't 89% it's actually 94% so soon i'll be the only one with a grade in the 90s lol

i thought it was that some assholes got lazy and just sent the fucker to the future
im a rogue with max dexterity and proficiency bonus in stealth. no one catches me

dont even attempt pink. it will destroy you
dont get dragonite started on faces
bethesda isn't dumb, they know announcing something like 76 so close to 4 with no tes would stir some shit
"we need to talk,i want to despise other people"
in other words, i'll buy it when it's cheap and hackers figure out how to hand out money
the fuck you mean 3 am?
you can play wow by yourself too

but still i'm hyped!

no part
also did i say 47? i meant 147, i missed a digit
i get that its an engineering course so it has to use the imperial system but i dont think the imperial system ever gave grades on a scale of 0-9
i wonder what dragonite's dietary councellor tells him during their meetings
of course ive only seen like 4

and it only really gives you the bonus ad for the brief time frame when you're in combat.

no i meant something akin to this type of it
god damn it he's been infected also

ah, gotcha
college is stupid
thats where the secret money comes in
whats that the code for?
"do you really want these kinds of people on the _normal_ part of the internet?"
you mean like stuck in one place until knocked down?
i think i gotta restart my laptop or just log out
yeah
but that really is me
so for some reason i decided to look through my teacher's github thing to see what he'd been working on
i'm still deciding if my eyeballs want to read it though
this is the original video
„ÉΩ( ÔΩ° „ÉÆÔæü)„Éé

i was going to make a recursive screenshot of ms paint except paint is being stupid
he does that in every episode

thank you
i don‚Äôt remember anything from calculus senior year of high school
oh well i am planning on getting you one thing when i get a job
that emote makes no sense a honker is a large fish
tbh mostly it's because i'm not good at vocalizing so everything sounds weird when i say it
i don't drink coffee
eh, it might sound like that
what does it mean to not feel tired
you make a few good trades and you can probably avoid the grind

how dare they
physics is fun tho
huh.

i love this university now
my pre-calc-2 professor allowed us to have a 1 sided piece of paper for any formulas we could fit, and as much scratch paper as we wanted
and drago no
greetings, bella.
like 20 minutes over due
thats the answer im going with
fuck no
okay
im gonna look at my next calc lesson
nice
reminds me i need to do my lab manual.
as soon as something went into motion it wouldn't stop
what
from what i've heard and observed
keep learning
so we can't definitively say it's infinite
and then you have logarithmic intervals as the video professes
let me go to sleep now
watch me
agreed, anyways, i got a game to play.  stop by my stream sometime, peace.
mkay..maky..
so i just had an email convo from my prof and he kinda gave me the impression that as soon as im done with math181 i just move onto math182 next semester

so you went into some rando's house and they told you it was pizza and you believed them without doing any prior research of your own

thats just when everything gets boring
i'm hungry
because quantum physics gets weirder the closer we get to -273'16
yeah that many pa on individual *atoms*
somewhere
gravity on neptune is only 11.15 m/ss
everything changes mass
so its a function and not a method, got it
apple products are gross

i did not
ive been in the atlantic before and theres no sharks
someone lost the sign
imma look at my next calculus lesson
did someone say dog?
like wasting time
5 pages long, the average lesson is about 10 pages or sometimes even crazier like 15 pages
it tastes like stale nothing
ooooh nice
neato
i dont mind english
if you get understood who gives a fuck
im surprised you found a way to open a box that had no door on it
so i guess you can throw windows out of windows if you envision the object your throwing out as a window
if there was no uni i'd prolly reach kilwala in one day
that's all im gonna say on that matter
so i'm worried
didnt i just put you in time-out for wasting food?
no just the comic pages
i had a good response to that but i forgot it
you only blew up the food? that's unusually civilized of you
ok maybe its a *little* bigoted
i can now
atlantic
my physics teacher roasted me today
that's fun too
my dads place had that and it always died loudly and violently
volleyball
i have fallen asleep with them on numerous times before tho
why is that surprising
if this was fight club
do people not do that
what game can we play together
how so
i wanna fight andi now
oh i guess i did
it's my home time that's poorly spent, either napping, watching youtube, or thinking to myself "i should stream stuff"
boy oh boy
why smelt a katana
is that a quantum mechanics joke
the fifteenth commandment clearly says that `thou shall not put chocolate and tomato on the same pizza`
discord stop sucking
and he like discover gravity

where did they run off to this time
no idea ive never played it
i write notes on my laptop for film class
me sleep now
shit not again
what happened?
all the while java being noun.verb().verb().etc.
look at these nerds getting sleep
but why would you do that?
plot twist i didnt go to bed i stayed up and read comic anthologies for two hours
is a service doggo?
i got all nostalgic when playing pokemon mystery dungeon when i remembered his old vids on those games. it's nice to see his community still active
but no one ever asked for my solution
do you mean patches
she would be mistress8998
thats the best name
he is the largest
is that a yes or a no?
everything
glad to see you missed me
i don‚Äôt like them either

does that count?
by then we had evolved past muskets which were fading out over that century in favor of actual good weapons
but can thanos convince dragonite's sister to take a cs class, is the real question

the poincare conjecture was probably my favorite unsolved problem to learn about
it broke like, 4 times?
i enjoy english
and?
go play with your cat or something
exponential derivatives are that easy?
better than infinitely bad is still infinitely bad
i wish i could say the same
idapoo would also work but ideepoo sounds better
other names it goes by sometimes sound like "formal logic" if that means anything to you
well go get a cat
appreciate it buddy
wait
that's a noni
ouch
also good job
the list just barely didnt fit on the screen, 255 is discrete math somehow and 256 is linear algebra
hooray for books and food
you just answered your own question
a what did a what and played what and where was i
i dont want to eat a rock covered in mud
whats the advantage of online classes
oh cool whens that coming out
i know mario maker hasn‚Äôt
~~xenoblade x~~
so you have to play twenty dollars a year to play a game. why would you do that
the only thing about that service that i'm still unlikely to try out is nintendo's voice chat. i know they're oldschool with a lot of their decisions, but a mobile app for online voice chat makes little sense even for their standards
i like that
so i have an english essay tomorrow
hmmm
you dedicate one day to homework?
priorities are s3 and v7
can you react with both to this message

which is very tiny but almost looks vaguely familiar
i guess i'll just have to live with this minor annoyance
why is that even a question
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
i too like panada's
i actually updated right after the update since it failed to install an update
twitter is the best social network there is, but that's like saying that
but i still think they need their own loveroms/emuparadise type of system instead of what they got for the nes games
flubs let's be honest
if i wasn't so lazy i'd dig out the discord join/drop sound effects and then play them infinitely into my mic just to confuse you
master are you compensating for something
i remember drawing a snowy owl for a project back in third grade all you see is a giant bird with tiny stick like legs and feet lol xd
its not a toggle
in other news dogs in cars are fun
i update it monthly

yo anyone want hate i got a spare
what skarm
last i checked soma was considered good
i'm waiting until a friend gets up to tell me
speaking of cacti, has that one guy said anything recently?
i prefer that
this does not bode well
trippy smooth version
because their solidifying the fact that im not a moron and i can actually do the material
i will give you some of my leftover popeyes chicken
what are the reqs?
so i have an hour before class starts so im screwing around in the computer lab trying to salvage my writing thing, and the more i read it the more i hate it
nice
anyways brb playing aatrox
a massacre
though some are admittedly purposely made stupid, for jokes
if you bend it far enough _everything_ can be an integral sign
well who knows maybe i deserve it
should probably also farm derilect survival for octavia more
because i was boosted and briefly thought guardian was aftershocik
i oddly enjoy looking at stuff i can‚Äôt buy and have no use for
both places were good but we go to lowes more now
flubs i love how worked up youre getting over this
sure
previews are nice sometimes

it‚Äôs cool that they gave a riven
whats the difference between a butt ton and a normal ton
like +30% strength
gonna try to sleep now
she is sick though
as per usual
i realize drago has beaten me in every social media
oh you mean ripping off of r/writingprompts class
maybe i can misspell all of the names a different way every time and see if anyone notices
that takes skill
gonna go watchwestwing();}
they can *do* that?
or if you're behind the times, impact font.
i dont think this one has a right answer
and when you die it stops being your problem
everything's a library card if you bribe the librarian with enough
that's what "formatting" means right
basically
that was master's bad idea not mine
as you know, fred
actually
oh hey alan walker is in top 100
mines on the top

i did a really good typo earlier
<:failfish:372152438355918848>

very badly
thats a first of those
and there are no paper cartridges
huh, don‚Äôt see it
greetings all those who are kind
video games
hello person
thanks
i can inv you
but is it differentiable?
brb pretending to be productive today
or you could say a= -2/x
i wasn't complaining, i was just giving my thoughts based on what i've heard
it's not about whether you can afford it, it's about what you're getting in return
becoming school teacher is harder than it looks
is rate my professor a working thing in canadialand
too late doing calc first
just saying personally, but the 4 years are a literal 4 commitment so it‚Äôs the same thing
final*
i started taking ap chem as a sophomore but then dropped it because i was barely even going to class
im in such a good mood
well that‚Äôs easy
ok enough of being a huge nurd, time to do dog chores brb again
also i apparently have no role in that sheet
i should probably tag him hun
you have no valid point
it‚Äôs normal probably
it‚Äôs not surprising, but official
is that a good thing or a bad thing
because i do the dumb
was that because you didnt speak english or because you answered "musket" for every question
should have learnt french instead
i got chewed out in first grade
i have poems to read. hopefully
leave'er johnny leaver ohh leaver johnny leavr. for the voyage is long and the winds don't blow

they also have metal
if it was easy everyone would do it
thats the boy
no it would probably be the timestamp of the last time the page was edited
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay hiccupping again
here we see the dragonite taking a half hour to get out of bed as he continues to fiddle around with his metal spaghetti dinner from last year
i thought it was unusually sane in here but i assumed that squid just left the window open again
it keeps fuckin changing
oh, so he's too busy getting x to divide by zero to get y
and slap this one girl at bronycon i hate
that...doesnt make sense
yeah
okay then
and nitain
nah that sounds like work
snorlax
good gravy i want to get stuff done but i have a cold and cant think straight
i almost always get some vegetables with steak orders
yeah the cpp standard is like nope
the revolution was the wii's code name
i have like

<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>

if its the size of pluto
\:thinking\:
theres not that many pink nu to choose from
right as you say that one of my cats tries to sit on the face of the other
that fuckin fat kid ruined the show
wasn't sure if it was canonical or not
i was just surprised
thanks this is confusing panda
i mean this wouldn't be the first time he's attempted to save something
mine is usually somewhere between -100 and 5000
saturn
and that worked out fine without it (?)
then you'll know pain <:rooderp:399827526744014848>

i mean theres no way he *isnt* but its a question of to what extent is he
even though i‚Äôm not bad at formal essays, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre enjoyable
let me guess
of bugs
i uh...... no
you've been tricked
but its nice
because si
did you try turning them off and turning them on again
is the frame slot the issue?
one of them i‚Äôm too sleepy to try.
the easy one is 10 slide kills without damage
that might have been a different game though but im pretty sure it was xenoblad
reyn time basically the most well known meme that is not "i'm really feeling it" from that game
i don't remember seeing one like that either
who here is dumb?
ive had that happen twice and waited it out both times
so i stopped doing it
also this is happening
but i learn an important lesson, that caring is often enough to get us through and to be happy
redemption arc‚Äôs fine
<:rooaww:399827525599232000>
that one almost doesn't seem thematically correct

i wanted to know
wowee
~~aeiou.~~
its all you talk about
not that logn ago
aegh
what
sense of pride and accomplishment
it's also got an eta of never because it's an entire aaa sized game being made by a few people in their free time on a rapidly obsoleting engine
i need to mod my skyrim
they‚Äôre just windows stuff before 7
does that matter though
i use an adblocker so who cares if they target ads
and you wanted to get insurance
yeah i did one of those a while ago
enjoy spending money on shit you don't have to because "it's the way capitalism is'
i see thanks
you're hopeless.

eh, probably not going to drink that much anyway
this also confuses
if you can‚Äôt fill out a resume without help, how do you expect to live on your own?
my family does everything for me and i know this shit
if you tell a woman you‚Äôre jealous of her beard, you better be ready to get thrown to the moon

which is unusual. don‚Äôt get those often
so would that mean like all of his 2869 lines of spaghetti get randomly recombined with someone else's 2869 lines of spaghetti or something
okay, this is going to sound weird but hear me out.
though honestly, haven‚Äôt come across that problem
whats the most outer space sounding song in skyrim

you mean there are people who _dont_ show their passport when asked for id
master do you even know the words to ragnar the red
kix once banned someone for copy pasting a question over and over until someone answered. it was great

(‚ïØ¬∞–¥¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ /(.‚ñ° . \\)
if she doesn't pay me back you can tell me i told you so
acrobat reader can die in a fire
i imagine that's relatable
just code triple battles and then copy paste it but subtract 1
do you want to tell him or
or maybe pok√©mon battle royale

oh so it also turns out that these new tools are somewhere between nonfunctional and hopelessly broken
ive never applied online but ive only ever applied to one job and that ended pretty poorly because i got the job

he didnt even look at the damn directions on how to complete the assignment
what is ash's worst pokemon battle?
you should read the directions on how to complete the assignment before taking up 4 hours of your fellow student's time
as do i
thats fair
also its probably a lot easier to have adult intervention offline if they see it happening
i need a full size version  of it to comprehend
in college its full of people who are millions times more humble and they're just more real
yeah remembering an infinite set must be a swell time
thats dumb

kugal right click on the guy

but my social life been boomin recently and i just dont have much chill time anymore
but dual wielded
nobody at work knows tho
also it supports out skyrim supports voiced languages like polish and japanese and stuff. i should set my language to that and see if i can still understand anything.
yep, that's how uni is
youd think there was a bunch of dust in there or something but there isnt
i didnt diss it

your dog is dead
since we're still in q1 here
i do not insist
and make that annoying dragon that spawns by the college turn into a pile of living chickens on death
i don‚Äôt want it to work like that
hmm there's one section where one of the graybeards uses a gendered pronoun when talking about the player character, i wonder if they correctly change it if you play as a girl or if they just assume nobody would notice
usually, though
looks like the only boss frames i need now are mesa, atlas, and nekros
i feel like im cheating
i had no school today yet i still did some school work
i might be able to, but not quite right now
my love life
i can kinda see that
it was like after 40 mins in before 48
i slept for 14 hours but woke up early
guys i think skyrim is a singularity
i couldn‚Äôt stay asleep for that long unless you killed me
sorry
i just got done playing skyrim 15 minutes ago
and you don‚Äôt have it on your switch or pager or rock
that's $50,000 an hour and you've been here for at least thirty seconds
because some aspects of programming are more complex than rocket science.
i kind of want to know what would happen if you set up a battle with like five hundred participants using my code
20 or 40?
maybe a shiba
happy womb escape day
k back
im not sure if i just complimented you or insulted you
rip zeal wheel: he had a short life
fucking ask her
there‚Äôs only a couple shows where that‚Äôs ok

"can i pronounce its name?"
damn
haha time to make fun of a movie
i found 36 ds and 45 gameboy advanced/color games in a box of my old stuff
so more i go to get
its fine in sandwiches but doesnt work well in ice cream or candy imo

when did it become 10
whos aqua
~~aqua is now magma.~~
of course they aren't bad
rikara did not deserve to go play at worlds at any capacity
i rather see them than 100 thieves at worlds
im hearing aphro wanted meteos kicked and cody sun out
they already knew they wouldn't have wom
they could have let him one game since he worked all year to get them to worlds
obviously rikara was playing in challenger series for one year and academy for most of this year
could make sense though
well shit, how am i supposed to come up with that money?
no reason for him to
its your brother
agrewd
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
gonna do one more run for the night
i just made the "all required move effects do their job" milestone, the question is, do i keep going or do i finally just play skyrim
i just kinda wish my midterm would get graded already so i can see the horrible score i know i got
still no octavia
like if i dont show my work in the best way he usually wont care, as long as i came to the right conclusion and he knows its my honest work i get full credit
so that fucking joey with 100 metapods doesnt beat you by running you dry on pp
my profs don‚Äôt even let you see questions you missed if you didn‚Äôt get to class early enough
the only thing i dont really like much about the class is how some questions we are tested on but arent explained how to do them properly
i mean yeah if i choose arceus or dialga or something i'd just look like an egomaniac
and it's been 5 minutes
in practice the above is false
these are closely guarded doctoring secrets
and smelled like perfume
top ten things said before disaster
that sounds like a euphemism for something to do with the toilet doesn't it
i got a fiora bug fixed by getting on the front page of r/lol once
now to do it with all the consonants. <:kappa:374346980136058893>

theyre still not part of the game's files though
hey man dont judge the dwarves on their cooking techniques
so did the dwarves get yote or just kinda fuck off and stop existing?
incantations are probabaly part of summoning
but should i really?
i know right
is dragonite awake _before 10:30 for once?_
this is non-negotiable
i can‚Äôt give up on league when i never played it in the first place <:kappa:374346980136058893>

good job?
guess who got an email saying that class was cancelled!
why didnt dragonite see said email?
i recorded stuff earlier. need to edit it sometime

#getidaoutside
i should probably record something

my desk drawer is jammed shut and that's where i keep my wii remotes

instant coffee
and i loved it
both on pc and phone
becaues that'll take forever
i have notifications turned off
one of my programming teachers told me i failed the midterm because i answered all six qurstions instead of choosing five
nick valentine has the same voice actor as belethor and a bunch of other minor skyrim characters
okay, so where you do want me to put this lighter fluid at?
silly dragonite its not the pastime its the career
its so very fair and balanced that he gets a free soul charge
dont do that its bad
buy food to make into food dont buy instant shit
honestly i think a lot of people would stay in the server if they were greeted by a bot calling them a fuckwad and saying he was gonna murder them
his excuse was that he has bipolar disorder
im curious now
i have uploaded all of my 2014-2015 super mario 3d land videos
depends on the topic
you should do a histiry essay on tbe history of history essays
but they have tacos and burritos
the best thing ever
that‚Äôs how i was until 2016
drago
i also like cheese
which makes you eligible for a parking ticket
like some people do
the latter
so i'm in no way tempted.
blackwake is on sale
it's a dessert pastry made of phyllo bread, filled with a mixture of crushed nuts, and held together with a syrup.
despite someone gifting it to me
and then there's stuff like the halting problem and the unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics
your body wants you to get coffee ice cream instead üòâ
also take everythign i say with a grain of salt, im just angry, i dont mean anything i say
i don‚Äôt, so i don‚Äôt know why i want one
just to give ya an idea

i went out of a bathroom
i should probably install a virtual machine with ubuntu or something
with spongebob
interesting
but the c did not accept the peace treaty
i can‚Äôt get my head around it
sounds fun. might be able to later
they had a strange start schedule but its evened out
i guess they didnt make any in the years i played nintendo games
pls use code word
i was busy
i dont think i played anything on the gamecube
why has no one used pick up lines on me?
when elder scrolls 6 is cancelled, dragonite
nobody has it also how the fuck do you get robbed by a me
secrecy
sot has more content, which is saying something
<:doit:334014889137930240>

a majority of my diet is frozen food and cold cut sandwiches
that doesn't seem right to me
howd you get that funky n
ahhh
<:doit:334014889137930240>
ida aren't you taller than most people
i hate you
i'm popeye the sailor man, i'm popeye the sailor man! i'm strong to the finish 'cause i eat me spinach, i'm popeye the sailor man!

i have an opportunity to record xenoblade today, the question is, can i be bothered to turn my wii u on
predicted death date: 8 december 2057
does that help
wait you have your normal icon how did you do that?
better than canadian weather
lmao even wolfy doesn't like "to-mah-to"
so thats $60 an hour for private security and $2600 for the flight and hotel
i will pay for her food though
ftp is for like lettuce and cabbage and stuff though there really should be a separate protocol for the important stuff
i have to do a paper... but its also halloween.
xenoblade it is
uhhh
academic or professional?
nice nice
<:doit:334014889137930240>
when is paper skyrim coming out
also probably why i don‚Äôt like them
im a kaiser
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
oh they definitely are
that's not what i was going for
i think halloween is moreso a fashion show now
i hate halloween
you record your office?
and its not fun
depending on context, especially the dwight one
but i love ryan
the office
he left his kid at the end so what? he's cool
not on netflix
because spoopy memes
there is a 25% chance she will say no
with what sleeping? <:gwcentralpikalul:377110562116468766>
i do get made fun of too if i slightly grow it out
works for me a little too well
jeez that box office is a lot
hey man i profit regardless
also that ^
<:rooblank:399827527289536512>
and i usually take my coffee skim and 0-3 sugars depending on the day
weird, i can do that soon
panda, let's go get coffee
i start every morning with a triple mixed with milk and chocolate protein powder
mini√© rifle
but now i'm gonna make sure she thinks you're hideous
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
besides you can't hurt me rainy
and that i should stick to history
i got acne on my forehead as well
i am gonna kill her tomorrow!
my own sister against gum
because eventually you cross a line and you go back to us and ask what you did wrong.
me neither (sorta)
on purpose
i think i‚Äôve only seen an episode of scrubs
i told her she is the best
i just said she has more than you.
i prefer a slumber party
bam roasted
it‚Äôs like what me and drago so
oh look it's three in the morning how'd that happen bye
i wouldn‚Äôt know what to order. i should try that out
it‚Äôs fake
what do i sound like? some attractive guy that all girls fall in love with?
of what the literal differences were
he is lonely
real men play mario kart
smash just gets way too much hype and attention
mario kart 9 is happening?
good enough for me, thanks guys
okay well i blame flubs
wonderful, thank you
that certain emperor is me
and i can‚Äôt say i want more from the game because tons of people will call me selfish or ungrateful and say i should be happy with what we already got. fucking stupid
oh flubs she got sick tomorrow
yeah, i guess that‚Äôs a point
there you go
him too
in fact i appreciate it
flubs
what did you say to you know who when you asked her out?
no problem
so i would say they were sweet?
its only two late when one or both people are dead
what else?
i wouldn‚Äôt care unless they were still dating someone
not an a hole
just have no self esteem
you mean my little one or ida?
well good luck with that whole thing. personally ive given up on relationships because i suck at them
and upset
in my life time
yet you were in the hospital waiting for her
although skyrim would technically be useful in that it would prevent me from eating any more candy and that's probably a good thing
i need someone to help me grocery shop
ahaha no
nobody goes to the arcade anymore
i'll buy wine
no offence ida i know you would
why is the library a choice?
so i would have to pick
just think in less than a year you'll be able to go to a bar
probably helps not to limit it to one place
there is this good ice cream place...
farmers market it is
or what bella said
that is benny's date
not mine
is there a stream right now?
i lost my gba and my ds with the slot in the bottom
i got rejected
yes you can
tuesday no matter what
but can i ask when will king of zeal/superskarmory will be back recording for youtube again?
that kid who i blocked, his brother confronted me about it in the middle of class
i am a disappointment to myself
skyrim
<:lul:305559915714576385>
"we got to have.... *moneyyyyyy*"
i'm not sure on how many stages we got with smash 4's dlc btw
>that sad moment when you realize you have a stronger connection with piranha plant with the games you've played over the characters in the fake banner/grinch leak since you haven't played those characters games
the german empire anthem is amazing
like why do you care, lol
the "not-so-great" maze.
hopefully there's not going to be another stupid great maze again
next week boys next week....
yes its more chill than secunda, dragonite
how many square tomatoes is it if each tomato is 3
which is better than platforming imo
i have my character predictions ready for the dlc
like so many times i wish micheal would bully her hard
nah, just felt like saying it
still gunning for elma and joker, though i have my doubts.
who probably got it from somewhere else
for the record i didn't invent you rang i got it from foxtrot who got it from the addams family
i could have invaded canada with all of my stupid high school videos
i am a hair person
you said yeet like 6 years before it became common
how did i miss that
oh you know what it's private
so greenland is on white witch time
the 90s were a mistake
i loved playing as them
anyways, i have nothing to do until stephen‚Äôs extra life stream starts in around 3 hours
destiny 2 is supposedly free until nov 18 but i cant find where tf the free version is downloadable
and i tend to call myself a cat so that makes me a furry
-----.----
good maybe i should not give a shit more often
...----...¬∑-¬∑-¬∑---.......------..---
..-...-...--......--
and it actually takes months unless you pay money
¬∑-¬∑-¬∑-----.---.....--
see if the achievements were no hit a boss or complete the game at sl1 thatd be fun
you know what better than that
like i just dont enjoy the action of eating
poor paris
run from it
im also wondering this
peggy still arives
and the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade and told of bold lies and the gold he had made
as much as i would love to see everything go down, i have work tomorrow afternoon
aint nobody cooler than this dan
are they nice?
be a shut in neet who hasnt seen the sun in two years
amazing island is *already* back in fifth
sup pham, i just got a switch, so if u got one and wanna add me, here‚Äôs my friend code.
i wake up at 6 for work. makes me feel like i have a productive day
yeet
1 am
i do indeed
interesting
well gives me a few days to work out what i wanna say to her
it's also a secret excuse to eat hamburgers all weekend because all of the other food in the area is either expensive or trash but dont tell my mom i said that
it hurts
i still dont know *what* magfest is
i give you my presence
its directly across the sound from me and they have cheap crab and cheap alcohol
drink alone in sadness and cryu
wing together a perfectly calculated setup
it's like 1974
freedom it is
wait stream is on now?
thats why
when going to nyc we do usually stop at albany overnight to visit friends tho
you should probably do that too
guess i'm going to hell (the piece is called the gates of hell btw) lol xd
only convention i know what i want to go to
"let me make my *entire fucking life* public
drive into pillars, is a good insult
but i like free experience and money
well i need a script writer
also writing is hard \
flubs, you need to react to more than just the c
dont google that
i dont have his phone number
they're waffling about somewhere, i'm sure.
how dare she say that
brb class
well i need a lawyer and my sis is the only one that knows how to do this law thing from those ace games she played
i have it
it made a really loud nosie
well yes. but sometimes we don't like fractions and prefer decimals
do you want a wall of 3's, flubs?
but with the question of dec100/dec3
twitch is broken for me
tomorrow i meet up with the girl who rejected me
not the "no one noticing for 30+ years" but
i regret going down this road
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
oh wow
also i used a random follower for the boethiah quest and now i feel terrible
second on the list is annoy drago
also the more i talk to my uni friend
the disadvantage of a morning class: i really want to get the thing we need to do today done already
he lives!
well flubs
there
thats on them
i don't do that unless asked
according to vikings they don't say that
i only hug people i like
you'll learn to enjoy it
history?
lets all go to magfest
only if you take them according to prescription
i sold my civic duty for drugs
im lonely
i know
so it's even
okay, because 100%ing mm is not as bad people say it is, and you're also on the remake and not the original
<:lul:305559915714576385>
because video game movies are famous for being well-made and successful
congrats
and then give it all to me because it was my idea
wait how can the big man move
not do oot: master quest blind, probably
i gotta wait 20 minutes for the bus
anyone here?
well
....
fiddlesticks
first thing in mind that i think when math is said is calculus
is there any actual use for a function whose order is 29
i forget what the other name for the biggest exponent is
is that my cue to spend the next four hours writing code for things other than classwork or
what‚Äôs wrong with breakfast
but that method is gold
things it doesnt do right: 68,7634,541
things it does right: 1
the "getting up before 10:30" part
maybe 4th
i woke up at 9 today and really wasn‚Äôt into it
yeet
it is bad
like i said to that certain person i saw, he could always be dlc
im a kaiser
someone should collab with me
get it out of my head!!
flubs we should hang out sometime
<:lul:305559915714576385>
welcome!
ironic that it's with breana
and somehow he likes me
i have a heart with someone on snapchat
most shit post admin would be...yeah prob master
i don't..
ida don't encourage him
i do
no you're not
sorry ida but i can't take orders well or do something i don't wanna do
yep!
i would have destroyed everything
to be honest
i like war but usually when i am here i think about it more
this server is not nearly as mentally taxing as some others i'm on
someone lemme know if thats too harsh, i'm legit not sure
no drago
okay the last time i ate breakfast voyager 2 had officially left the solar system, but only just barely
im too rough now
and one of them threatens to punch me
ida i need protection
who has heard of the war of 1812?
werent there two of them
we are gonna do that

even the rejection ones
thank god since i hate kisd
just remember you got your whole life ahead of you
you weren't as annoying
theres some things i want to catch in the pok√©walker but it requires me to get a lot of exercise and i dont feel like walking the dog or going a bunch of circles in the kitchen
nest
i'm leafleaf
we've talked about this before
i don't remember but it might be
this let's play stuff i will only work on
<a:atpc_jumpcited:485160985028460546>
thank you.

i gotta get through that
so nekopara is on switch now
hey heard about that new undertale prequel game?
sorry
and flubs
not the first game
didn't know who it was so i rejected the request
but back then it was absolute horseshit and no one wanted to pay $60 + a monthly subscription for a shittier version of wow
wowee
usually just end up getting 50 in one handed and giving up and go full warrior
and probalby even more that ive never heard of
two handed or some sorta conjurer is what im leaning toward rn
hmmmmm
because i'm terrified
still the same thing in oblivion
but you could conjure armor along with that
i have 108 as my iq
i dont like playing as an archer
lab mates and i today picked up beans with different items in the name of science.
why were there germans in hong kong
i haven't had cereal in years though
also did anyone hear about defy media shutting down?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
don't
95% chance
hi person
you rang
~~screw family~~
i'm not responsible for hurricanes, power outages, comcast, and acts of god
i have downloaded a dating app
should i play skyrim
but i have a rarity beach pic when i pretend to be rarity
would have love to see how that would turn out
thanks i've been up for 3 days
two in the morning is nothing
shes been dead for like a billion years so yeah the new old people who live there would probably be confused
i could pet your dog for you while you're away doing redacted
high
hi dead i‚Äôm squid
it's what i'm about to listen to
he did
uh huh...
im about to do the craziest thing ever

hi i'm fucking done, i'm--oh screw this
for once i thought about it
imma do it
tortillas have been eaten sleep now
did it involve beans
greetings and salutations, dan! welcome to the kingdom of zeal!
this is one of the rare times i use the mlp way
flubs i did something stupid after you left
drugs?
there we go
<:rooderp:399827526744014848>
yes?
just be like me and make all your videos terrible <:kappa:374346980136058893>
how do i do the tm thing?
but it's _almost as if the author has never installed an mmo before!_
but you didn't let him get ahead
it is right now
you don't have to pay me i just want to pet dogs
omg looking at the old msgs i was way more energetic back then
holy shit i was not like what i was last year
who even knows
someone tell daylights savings to stop so i don‚Äôt want to sleep at 5 k thanks
hey ida hows the arctic circle the week before christmas?
like before daylight savings id feel like i was gonna get axe murdered on my way to work but now i dont
dark at 5? weak
you can't threaten me
dark
thanks flubs
so i am angry to this day over it
flubs wireless or wired?
agreed
it was online
that concerns me slightly less than mr. joe on street street knowing everything about my daily life
and i thought ida was actually gonna end up like one of them because when eyan's server started she just went super mean to me

quiet keyboards are nice
his daughter confirmed he is dead
i really want to play rdr2
stan lee is dead.....
otto was cooler than lincoln
oh god, we‚Äôre probably going to get 3-5 inches of snow tomorrow
today i learn you can make ice
history lecture pls
i can make a math/history vid
im listening to music on it just fine
2. enough flour
i'll get back to you in a few days

that sounds like peripheral abuse
fancy that
is stream potato or is it on me
im not drunk im flubs
i‚Äôll take the silence as a yes
yes samsung made it
okay, ,the show more input i guess broke
that brings you to a grand total of 55,682 years in jail or cleaning the toilets in the zeal palace until the end of eternity
what‚Äôs eyan streaming? xcom again?
good to know it's still functional i gu‚Äînever mind
no he is not
yeah youre definitely up late
vampirism is great though
that sounds like vampirism but worse
but yet you want me?
guys.
the amount of dog pets that must happen per second is greater than the amount of seconds that happen per second
so someone tell me why my computer mouse is half beaten to death?
never give them back to me ever again
sooo yeah
yeah
im trying my best to assist
dont say that to her please
wait
i need that medicine
like?
always wanted to experience a life of a soldier in the 18th century
go to razer
i had fun there
top ten smartest human beings who broke the system
but you seem to enjoy life
people are always angry there
though flubs happens to not get under my skin at all...
now i don‚Äôt
tbh most of the reason i dont stew in a pot of self hatred and loathing is because id be justified to and people wouldnt really be surprised
platinum
like i only dont at this point because i didnt before
cats aren‚Äôt that bad as i originally thought
actually looks great...
i know, but that just gives me a few basic ideas
we've proved that ‚àö2 is irrational, we've proved that the number goes on forever, isnt that cool?
ida wanna cut my hair?
you'd think that would be impossible
and thats what makes it so not absurd
hey flubs did you know there's the quadratic equation...and the cubic equation? for cubic functions, functions like x¬≥ and not x¬≤
well, math isn't simple because life isnt simple
idk maybe the higher level shit is cool but i never did any of that
i like science and math though! d:
ok mr 100%
if they dont get high state test scores then some bad shit happens to the shcool or whatever
knowing how to do basic multiplication and the primary colors doesn't exactly make you look smart
which leads me to think about war the most when i am here...
you're just gonna buy new ones aren't you
9th grade i took algebra, 10th grade i took geometry and algebra 2
but now it's like the complete opposite
im currently in intro to stat and calc 1
algebra 2 had *some* trig for me
dinosaurs are fucking awesome
done with my phone call
not for me though üò¶
here ill teach you about dinos instead
theyre fuckin awesome
bully them back
make them feel useless
do it!
bully them back
why is it not alive
i could win a world record for how stupidly redundant i can be
butter on cookies?
no theyre like so vanilla that they dont even contain vanilla
why do i have to suck at this game so badly
weird right
yes they have animals with names like kangaroo and wallaby and blue-ringed octopus
the answer is yes
fuck
im getting flash backs to poems some girls in my highschool wrote
probably
this "3d rendering system" thing is haaaaaaaaaard
not anymore
"shut up my sentret needs the exercise"
right skarm?
i also considered microwave oven and motorized can opener
and then it ends and you are even sadder because it‚Äôs over
i fixed my mouse btw
i broke it with a hammer and fixed it with a hammer
poetry for fun is really pleasant
human with a side of aged honey mustard
i like it
is 70 kg a lot and is 20 m/s a lot
not with that attitude
maybe i should just take it up to the roof of the english building and drop it
imma become an artist
i held!
nahhh
hey ida civ 6 next?
oh, eyan‚Äôs streaming
t=+15 minutes and teacher is swearing at git, as usual
i was one of those until i wasnt
but i held on
watts aren't a lot
climate change sure is good aint it
and not july
or do you?
can‚Äôt i just create a goddamn palindrome
but then you would need shirts with three sleeves
but you would definitely pet it 50% more
well
this will be the stupidest thing i ever do
both
everyone gives me a less than 1% chance
nah cuz if i did that i couldnt get on to the night terrors as quickly
rit is not a state university
first off, mood
and i just made up some 9 year olds new gamertag
second semester was more of the same plus a political science elective
pretty sure that's tje gamertag of a kid on my bus
i like using 489 in names because its very witty and im quite smart
dont enter rem
dude being sad about the future is next level
as i say
this one
i'm in a permanent cycle of mad and sad
i'm falling asleep from boredom at the same time
dragonite, you do cool things, stop
"opportunity"
that‚Äôs the only way i‚Äôve ever said it
is hampshire not pronounced with the shur part
i want to pet my dog
black cats always win
i can love both
but she's sleeping in dad's room and i dont want to wake up dad just to pet my dog
unnecessary
demon lord you should upgrade to a dog
why on earth would you want your code to execute _slower_
i remember begging my mom until we got one xd
he's of contrary opinions
on the other, what kinda shitty ass parent would disapprove of a class that helps their kid be healthier and more active
no im lazy
but nowadays cats are easier for me to take care of
i tend not to like the kids who play it
1% chance to get her back
it just still feels way too early for this area's snow season. and it's not supposed to be winter yet
fuck i should be sleeping
dab drago
bella i'm kidnapping you and forcing you to live in the temperate part of the country so you can suffer with the rest of us.
and its got mountains
if it's about me
again
this, a song of sons and daughters
when you grew up in phoenix
hmmm
shall we watch again?
the bear thing killed me
you‚Äôre fat
hey drago
how much do i have to pay you to use that?
well tbh i don't know either
he got the wrong target.
does rarity work?
hey ida would you punch me in the face if i started shipping you with rainy
i just go with w/e
you should use my node script to generate random usually-pronounceable character strings
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
i got two gay big sisters yay
rainy's cute, i don't mind
one hangs out with me through games and one hangs out with me through vc
a trans?
wait i was dating a trans
transgender*?
you already have a stockpile
my mistake
the answer is violence, dear rc
best friends would be ida, flubs, stormy, and breana
haha what a fuckin loser. being mentally stable sometimes. what a nerd
today a prof told me to make a medicine wheel
civil war...you are talking to a friendship and war general
i love queer circles
but im like bi polar
i will individually break each and every one of your knuckles
that's uh, most of the reason i made it
ditto with ida and master
i forgot it
that was suppose to be an insult
i am genuinely happy that they see me like a younger brother
i like trolling hardcore here
what is a noitarepo
that would be awesome
got my hands on nova prime. what do you think of this moon themed fashion frame?
clyde
and when the truth finally dawns
this is fun
lowering the brightness by like 20% did it
i‚Äôll take your silence as ‚Äúyes‚Äù
if you asked an order of seconds earlier i wouldve signed up
if i have it i guess
it took me 10 seconds
it happened before i lost it i went to class in the rain a bunch of times
mood
same, rainy
i think it's that they look at the game with the highest accumulated review score
kingdom of introverted ninnies: civil war
so maybe ones like kotaku's review of the game might be a factor as to how xeno 2 didn't get it instead of dragonquest.
good job
i like beef
thanks i think i was happier not thinking about that
would there be a challenge run for pok√©mon or/as
same thing with my dad actually, you would think at first he's the nicest guy on the planet, but when you start to spend time with him, that's when things start to go downhill
that's only three hours are you okay
personal favorite kind is the one where it only gets funnier and funnier and you  can‚Äôt stop laughing, and you try to stop, making it funnier
it‚Äôs always good to get out for a while
never played either. both look ok to me
guys
yes flubs you can once i am done with it
though pls don't upload nsfw
yeet
there's your score
wait a minute why is dragonite on the side of the physics engine while im supporting the compiler
without the catalyst of math the leaps to get here would never be made, not before the heat death at any rate
flubs say something funny
you should pick a fight with like a bumble bee or something
i wanna hear little dratini stories
ida wanna talk about pie or something
pogi was the leader
i was very close to one though
that was drat‚Äî
its just an example of when sending someone to prison is ok
i mean getting someone sent to prison ruins their life but if they murdered your parents it prolly justified
okay new plan let me dig around
but resetting every time you accidentally blow lydia off a mountain is annoying
why do you own all the dlc if you gave up ten seconds into the base game
in that case do i have you guys' permission to change his name to "drago's toast"
i rounded down a bit
so you _did_ beat the tutorial bear
***hey dragonite did you hear your baby cousin won an award for marching band and was named ceo of earth, incorporated and has a girlfriend*** and by the way are you still like alive and stuff?
(‚óï Œµ ‚óï)
but dont 100% it because the dunwall city trials are fucking horrible
so don't watch that
which are basically semiannual two-week black fridays
but....
no i definitely cant
well if you're ever looking for more harddrive space i think i saw a 1tb ssd somewhere for like $130~140
socks are the only garment humanity needs
youtube just shitted itself again
squid arent you boneless though
and ive been trying to get out of those for _decades_
black bear
ewwww
what show
okay, his favorite food is the fingers of people who aren't as smart as they think they are
> math
and you love the fat guy
ida if you don't know what those are you probably dont want to look it up
problem is
wasps. oh wait, that's deadlier
do you have like an atom bomb i can borrow
crap i was in need of a filled soul gem
drago's pet shop
can someone kill me
with a mod
also creator studio bullshit is dumb
~~chicken breasts or real ones?~~ <:kappapride:379352530863521792>
i'm going to leave it that way until march
that should probably tell you something
actually i expected something worse
i could probably find a better one pretty easilyi though tbh
maybe when i have time wednesday
apparently it came back
didnt you only break up like three days ago
hey theres a statue of satan in a public square in kansas or something because of the confederation
flubs we need an anthem after this
drago you are greedy
worse.
i hate film
what is the film class about?
without a controller
sounds like a fun one
false: it‚Äôs a 51% chance
10,800 seconds until fantastic beasts
only skyrim, fo4 and 76 so far run on creation
well i dont like having a beard and facial hair because it's more trouble than it's worth
flubs
and even if its technically a different engine is it really *different*
but that one wasnt fromt he beginning i thought
so, uh, i wouldn't count on it anytime soon
you played mage
just play better 4head
i just dedicate a day to steam games
my recomendation would be awakening since its my favorite and its the one i started with
i should work on that
i kind of wanna play 100% orange juice
i'm bored and kind of want to play some multiplayer....
i just woke up from an exhaustion nap, hi eyan
i'm down to  play
gonna teach drago
hey eyan, is it still possible we might see you play fire emblem?
they all left me
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
yup but the plan this time was to fix it
blind luck
password?
thats the 26
go ahead flubs
true
charizard
i dont wanna get the thing tho
nonsense it's just soda poured on your hamburger so you dont have to eat them separately
we are all terrible. we are the hive.
round 2 rn
good lord squid
also did the rules change? i appear to be getting the cards that i play but are not selected returned to me
oh ida hates me today
the linkedin thing has a bunch of tags you can search by
it was the card i drew that turn
oh my god
god bless rngesus
oh ida forgot to leave and rainy is typing

its great
dammit
in other news it turns out that telling a computer to figure out if two angles are close-ish to each other is _ass_
kugal are you a fan of modulo division
me: ok it's midnight i should go sleep
from scratch
i think these stat questions are legit broken
i don't think we have one of those nearby in corn central
the only test i had to take was an accuplacer and bam that was good nuff
not dead
i havent played a pokemon game for years ):
so you pay to have a chance to pay to go to college
just dont take the tests
not higher paying jobs for college?
‚Äúwhat killed the dinosaurs? the ice age!‚Äù
did your ds charger not reach the wall outlet or something
i can talk about generics and abstract data types all day dammit
i was gonna say something about doing what makes you happy no matter the cost but yeet
the physics gnomes went on strike so gravity on venus is whatever it wants to be
and liberty and the pursuit of happiness
that's most likely wrong
its not dependent on if its a planet or not
well we're not taking the atmosphere into consideration
everything that exists that has mass has a force of gravity
it's back, without blank cards
so the moon isnt a planet because it doesnt orbit the sun, and pluto isnt a planet because its too small
different acceleration due to gravity
why arent stars in solar systems with two stars planets
that‚Äôs what kids do: repeat the same shit a million times until someone yells at them
first, they got to deal with the hundreds of thousands of people saying how terrible fallout 76 is
theres nothing on yt i want to watch. send help
it also doesnt matter because the atmosphere would dissolve your bones on venus before you hit the ground
oh my god, ,the score for the ps4 version...
keep in mind i was like 8 lmao
alright so i have to make a decision today. do i just eat turkey cold cuts with instant gravy on top or do i make myself an entire turkey and eat the same thing for a month
i named my sister voldemort in my contacts and now i flinch every time she sends me a message
big yes
one channel i've gotten into the last few days is mother's basement
three tiles
speaking of pokemon tho
i havent eaten at all today. this sucks.
aight well ive got 50 minutes so ill go start now
i'm bored

yes i know its terrible
he was a nice kid. gross though
how do you pat harshly
or that one
that's hammer bros and bloopers
:boxthinking:
sure idk its name
whatever that means
i think the last one has a story behind it
just not happy
i'm definitely creating enemies with the let's go base atm
i almost did that once fortunately the imposter site was trash and looked nothing like what the actual site looked like and i figured it out pretty quickly
~~now why would you accuse twitch grandpa of something like that?~~
speaking of bad man, some people in their patreon server might send stephen a shirt with ‚Äúbadman‚Äù on it. and mal is in on it üòõ
i need to be at breakfast stream more
nier automata is 50% off
makes sense to me.
you take away my modship so you can kick me off the team
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
i don't want emotions antymore
not anymore
oh it's not grey
i opened skype the other day and my eyes threw up
when is later?
i just remembered today is when we get stuffing.
~~so you‚Äôre a hoarder?~~
so all of the things that i'm probably going to be awful at
i ain‚Äôt doing good at understandin‚Äô your language
so prepare for reading
he'll never make it past that step
i‚Äôm so ready
or he‚Äôll get stuck at anger
though always wanted to be a girl for a day
now i look as superior as i am
im not a pony
i think i will teach him how to be like me
oh flubs great news i got a new right hand man
she‚Äôs gonna tease me
i poked through the source in the inspect element button lat time i was the card czar
yeah but i get to eat at dinner time not lunch time
and a bunch of stuffing and turkey and shit
he wont?
where is my invitation?
this also lets me play pocket monsters all day
yeah not a fan personally
what did i juat walk in on
what about your pink?
that is a combination of red and less red
role red
cousins annoy drago
god no
you do that while i make my new anthem
and put them all in the same room
yeah that ones integration assigned, ida
yeah thanksgiving in canada is not what it is down there
i threw so many tantrums yet always get something or someone i wanted
im thankful for ponies, my pony friends, war, and muskets
wow narcissistic much
makes sense to me
neither are as easy as that
easy
wack
more
but one of them went home and there is now 33% less dog in the building
or your skin
lol ida
bc im gonna put a hat on one but im not sure which yet
the closest one is string cheese dan
dan?
i keep hearing word about it, is it worth watching?
i saw it already, dragonite
bc like you gotta celebrate christmas right? but idfk how to do any of that shit besides the food
i dont mind turkey, its good, but i looked at what we're having and it looks 10 times better
both
stuffing? what is it?
stuffing indeed
its food and it is goddamn amazing
kugal youve only eaten like 3 foods shut
then i remembered you're canadian
there we go
mr food expert
whats the word. pm me it
mr food expert
master
he still has an alt somewhere around here that he mentioned earlier
do i want to know?
thats a nice way to put it majestic haha
fourth of july is only american in name
fair point.
happy capitalism.day
we shouldnt have months and just have 365.241 days every year
that wont work out
just hit the middle ground
rainy i'm going to force you to re-watch the movie over and over until you change your mind
functional 9/10
well he doesn't seem to mind
duck
what's it on?
indeed. welcome.
but i couldn't do it last night because mystatlab was under maintenance
just break webassign until he gives up using it
that‚Äôs some dark stuff lol
your face is infinity
yeah what i said is infinity but in math form
there will be a good amount of limit questions
one of my wisdom teeth just came in and i dont mind it
which is more differentiation lmao
ive started getting fancy with how i eat the same 3 foods
how much mass in kilograms remains in your leftovers?
oh definitely
and be stuck with my great-aunt?
either that or ill go into server settings when nobody's looking and add a greener nu role or whatever it's called
thanks
you know what's the absolute 100% best feeling in the world
that was me the entirety of bio a few years ago
that's actually pretty rare
do it for the tense pre-presentation college students
some professors make you memorize them and suffer
annotations were the big boxes?
youre right they did it because it doesnt work on the devices that account for more than half of all playbacks, _and_ most of the others don't use them
annotations were ass
in essence, today is a mess?
just check the comments of the wooly world videos
i think it's just average
welp, guess emile's comment sections now will be flooded with chuggaaconroy cultists. not sure how i feel about that
curse mobile and making it hard to show that
also i got a confirmation email saying im enrolled in calc ii, so thats neato. now i just gotta take my calc i final and kick butt and do my best and then i'll be on the road to more math lol
how the heck is 100 average
no one knows why
as far as i can tell
im saying some would if 0 was the average
cause that's hilarious
i definitely do because im an idiot but for fucks sake just move the scale to a better place
but does a 0 baseline not make more sense than a 100 baseline
so it's impossible to get negative numbers
bollocks im not green anymore
well, at a certain point it starts to decrease
it makes me happy that two-year-old me is on average smarter than now-me
the system was proposed by a psychologist
do you mean _your_ arms dont functionas swords
gotta make an email that wont be taken but will be looked at without being assumed to be spam
making throwaway emails is hard
ok cool
not trying to one up the suffering contest
wow. ive never applied to schools before and it‚Äôs kinda very scary
alright so i finally came back to my third run on emerald
i mean that'd be kinda cool now would it
also no greninja & charizard this time
i‚Äôve used all of those except for delphox
i was also so tempted to make azumarill a temporary team member yet again and choose crawdaunt instead
even then i haven‚Äôt played either in a really long time
im thankful for flubs
yeah, i still think the sequels in gen 5 are better than the originals
the final boss was better
ehh, i either loved or hated the changes (or lack of change)
if did not go well.
but that doesn't mean i will like it as a final boss
this is almost the exact same fight as we had recently
some people were annoyed with the changes to lusamine also
~~i think you mean climax boss~~
i thought the story in sun and moon was better than black and white. i just can‚Äôt be with everyone calling that the best story
also it was already confirmed that the 8th gen games will have a different engine to let's go and that they will be the best looking games in the series so far
i am convinced that they just look sun and moons engine and made let's go in hd
let‚Äôs go looked more like x&y in hd to me
you have to play a game to give a score
also to be fair
the most toxic and moronic nintendo sub community
sorry if my phrasing was bad
-rideable pokemon
i made a whole team of 6 follow you around once that was a glorious mess
brb getting food
flubs what should i buy tomorrow?
some people give me a weird look when i do it irl since they can hear me whisper it
essentially, greeks are cooler
are you comparing roman nanotechnology to bird doo
truly too ahead of their time
we can map out the entire chicken genome, put it onto a computer, then broadcast that via wifi which is really radio which is really electromagnetic radiation. thus you can radio people chicken shit
honestly the last half hour of talk in here is what enhasa should be like
darn
i wonder if youtube api allows you to get a list of discord users from those that join a channel
oh well maybe we just havent advanced far enough as a society to make use of inte or polo
here let me get the sum
is that not what you entered
probably
even if ya did then it still shouldnt be that high of a number lol
lucius appuleius saturninus, a tribune, passes a law to redistribute land to military veterans. the law requires that all senators swear to abide by it. quintus caecilus metellus numidicus refuses and is exiled. he goes to rhodes to study philosophy.
i dont have a good word for it but its too round i guess
soul color changes proportionally with numbers of unsolved murders
hahaaaaahhh
fun prank
you *must* know what that is
thats a new low for you
it takes being the most horrible to have that moniker
i've got to work morning concessions tomorrow. because we need basketball games in like 9 in the fucking morning, an elementary game at that
done
didn't help also that it took forever to get the nature and ability i wanted for my azurill also which needed to be happy to evolve, so that was fun with all of that walking xp
is it me drago?
radio silence speaks volumes
you can say it
only after accepting your low lewdness stat can you grow it
let's try and get eyan in, it's friday
(ssh, not here, rainy)
(maybe later)
you underestimate how dumb i am
i have one semester's experience with uni compsci
(‚ó°‚Äø‚ó°‚úø)
that‚Äôs how i am right now
squid stop hating things
shut up it's owls
i'm a month and a half into this run and it's been exceptionally smooth
nobody yet
hooray time for another round of me putting off contacting any of you until sunday afternoon when everyone's packing up
is it a coincidence that deci just came online or are you two planning on league?
also buh bye ida
you think that's bad? i'm just gonna drive 24 hours and kick in their room door
super nerd army
also i can also confirm that the friends suck ass in this game
i hope so
i‚Äôm already argonian
also what happened to not worrying about details and "fuck it just do it" in regards to youtube?
who remembers when memes had effort put into them
what else was there
it still takes some details ya ninny
romans didnt know it existed lol
dont have time to wonder into the  endless vastness of space
what the crap twitch
iv unit, extra large, liquid crystal display, direct message
alll valid abbreviations in modern language
ive counted to 4 in binary on my fingers a few times
something something noose nice
here's a gilgamesh one.
most video game characters do
what happens if it gets full
my mom would break physics
was recording something today and something catastrophic almost happened
greekid
think about it dragonite, going to go eat, get back to me later when i stream
it's very bad
i had to do one of those stall battles against his milotic with my walrein
does that bot help with music theory and the resolution of v7 chords?
i wish
tomorrow is black friday so i gotta go to best buy
i can but im not gonna do that quite yet,
that aloix guy is a fucking loser
til boxbox watches chugga
is that going on right now?
the teacher is talking about fishing with a guy who isn't in the class
oh human
i don't have much left and i'm going completely from memory because i'm at work
just my shorthand "draco" would suffice.  i know it's not fitting for a metagross, but it's less complicated that way.
well you don't actively make videos right now. üòú
now that's a good story.  üòõ
i feel lonely, sad, and bitter, despite being surrounded my a lot of awesome people.
i'm sort of in a similar position, only with college instead of work.
i'd be lying if i said i didn't have a lot of fears about it though
i'm worried that nobody will care, the world has changed around me quite a bit, but from a youtube perspective, i'm still the same old derpy kid who just wants to screw around with videos
i appreciate that.  right now, i think support is all i need
it seems like a huge liability, lol
rainy, you are one of the most important people in my life
i couldn't sleep right now anyways
i avoid it like the plague
i will admit though, i'm surprised how chatting with you guys isn't actually hurting my productivity that much
yo eyan, ping me wherever if you want, i'm get a tiny bit more sleep
i'm usually 8-4 if i'm in the front, or 6-3/4ish if i'm in the kitchen
plenty of sleep time
that sounds dreadful
the end
somebody
hey nerds
tis a good story
bella!
no thanks
50 sounds good when you‚Äôre stuck in the 30s all winter
what‚Äôs the hottest it gets around there?
i said special twice
it sounds lewd
wow, choosing that over me, i see how it is
definitely
just human
oh god, that's terrible
nobody should want to be reincarnated as me
besides, i'm not stupid, i'll be in a call with friends to watch over me.
irrelevent
eyan, outta curiosity, do you see a therapist?
so, to answer the question, some days it can be my entire shift, other days, not as much.  i'm "accounts payable" though so my job is pretty much just to pay bills
i have a bad habit of finding an excuse to not see one
much cheaper solution
now tell me a story
understood
i‚Äôll be watching the stream after i finish watching raw
i've been able to talk to my mom about my issues
how long does that take? like, does that take your whole shift or just most of it?
i can‚Äôt imagine one side of the county to another
no it's called fun mode
since she knew exactly what i was going through
holy crap it's brad
shouldn‚Äôt be too bad
working out does good things, therapy wise
i can do more, i just learned that once i got to about 3 hours, i started not liking it anymore
i know it's not the brad i know, lol
this may not be the brad you know
driving is fun for a while
why not fly if you have to drive 7 hours?
f
try a 9 hour plane ride
i usually stop at a denny's in middle of nowhere wyoming
i'm a capitalist at heart
wow, way to assume and talk about me like i'm not here
i try my best
you bastard
but "no futher punishment" is not a complete sentence
gift horses? are you planning on sending eyan a horse for christmas? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
ill be back in about half an hour if i get through volunteer duty fast
i‚Äôm not allowed to do anything around here
i'm a grinch, who needs santa hats
good job (‡πë‚Ä¢Õà·¥ó‚Ä¢Õà)b
also
yeah
i demand that somebody tell me a story
i demand the story of ragnar the red stop
kinky
i want an original story
once upon a time, a squid had to get ready for work. the end
there once was a hero named ragnar the red
guys, i think i just hit the lottery
too many scales for me
ok here's a story i'm recycling right now and the teacher decided to take a shortcut through the blizzard to go grab bags for recycling
try setting it on fire
also nice unintentional double entendre
i thought at least jake would be in it
that's the maids job
well they arent that popular and have caused a lot of problems for youtube
also bella, not a kitten
yo fuck thats a good point
he wanted to come with us
she is a cat
didnt she fucking murder subaru though eyan
high five
and my body
like i know it was a misunderstanding but she still murdered him pretty hard
beacon of feminism as i am, i've always wanted to be a maid
i'll pay for all of your needed maid expenses
i could be like the butler who always falls asleep and plays ds games on the job or something
i like maids
i can cook and clean like a goddess
we are strong independent women
of course to keep it in proportion youd have to remove the forearms and the middle of the torso
and how tall is ida?  lol
i feel like i really want to know what some of you look like
i think one of them is nearly 7 feet
my cousins have giants for parents so they‚Äôre all tall and it‚Äôs annoying
now we need a disappointed head butler. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
he's the butler
yeah, but i'm sure he would prefer dark lord of the sith and hand of the emperor
rainy had a soul? this is news to me
cats
not anymore
that's molag bal's domain
i don't really know what i want
love made with  pizza sounds mediocre at best
nice
that's an odd form of precipitation
i get the feeling you secretly want to actually be my maid, lol
just roll with it
hey you're  cute hon
public class lower{
eyan;
i never said i disliked ass, just i'm more of a boobs guy, lol
good job
did ya guys see youtube rewind 2018 came out today lol
later, eyan.
\*and he was never heard from again\*
i used to watch his stuff as well back in the day.
would i be bombarded by people‚Äôs surprise if i said i have never heard it before
<:kappaclaus:520412032042926080> and <:kingofchristmas:520412492787089408> are here for the holidays
how is red dead 2's music and art better than god of war's?
just dont watch shit you dont like, and if you do want to watch it for whatever fucking reason, dont make it our problem
guys it dawns on me that maybe eating a large amount of coffee ice cream just before midnight might not have been the best idea i ever had
thanks guys
so i‚Äôm not allowed to not like something popular? don‚Äôt act like you never go through it
i just want you all to know i went to bed at 6 so i could wake up at 1 am and play smash until work at 4:30 am
but that's being human imo
~~if it makes you feel better, i would probably be worse~~
his channel was my childhood
we'll see, the theme of right now is "screw it, just do it"
here, anyway
and sometimes it makes threats
it's people like you who stop by and remind me that i'm still remembered for what i accomplished so long ago
ted talk? this doesn't really feel like one of those
i've certainly gotten salty because of popularity for things i didn't care about.  it's not really a logical train of thought though, that much i will admit.  dragonite is right, why drain energy into caring about what's popular
emile goes on a noa rant for two minutes and fifteen seconds
ooof, drinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow.  how could i forget the golden rule
\:thinking\:
i think reality is slapping me over the face again
not sure how to feel about that
you got two parts in and then stopped.
that didn't work
i wish i could edit myself
ah, the best kind of reward
oh nice
but i legit thought i failed my calculus i midterm but got 97%
the college classes usually start later than my highschool semester but they also end earlier too
friggin hell yea man
thats not too shabby
otherwise i would have failed it miserably, lol
except for that one semesters in freshman year in highschool
oras starting now <:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>
gotta eat breakfast, bbl
you ca be the daedric prince of cats
to me i saw 'breakfast' and it's fairly early where i am so i was like "yea makes sense" in my head lul
i said skarmory, not skarm jesus christ
i‚Äôm back from work. eyan still streaming?
i wonder what would happen if i went around introducing myself as "mr spam"
oh i've come to terms with this revelation a loooooooong time ago pal
did you record a black screen again eyan
there is no reasonable hour
it's beginning of the month so we get a lot of monthly bills around this time so i've been building up for the last few days to a day of just sitting around posting them
calculated that back in june
why do anything simple when you can overcomplicate it
‚Äîdragonite family motto
congrats
welcome
but i've got an ass that you need to install a mod for
you mean the finger lakes? because those exist <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i‚Äôll try it first, but thank you
engrossing
50 mins
what _does_ this coast hve
darn it squid
is it really
yes! thank you kugal i thought i was the only one
when i got promoted
squid everyone knows governments work best when theres two leaders with opposing views who dont want the other one to win
there‚Äôs like 3
it was a 100 question ap chem test
lmao
i mean think about it. being a great runner but your name not being recognizable makes it easy to hunt people for sport but not get recognized while people snatching
fair point
so how are all the non-sick people doing?
and if you get spotted what are they gonna say? "5'7" white guy in his late 20s with an average build" like theyre gonna be able to find you out based on that
whats counts as being dead on the inside?
man im really out of touch?
sounds fun, but i don't think that story even has an ending
wow dragonite
then if your local recording doesnt have sound you can pull down the video from twitch, extract the track with just the game audio, and use that
soon‚Ñ¢
welcome to the show
he learns from the best
that‚Äôs west coast
yeah, no kidding
i mean, i was the one who came up with the term gigglebutt, lol
wow rude
spreadsheets actually require energy right now for me.  v_v
but he gives out free hugs sometimes
i need more confidence, and maybe a map
i had to bother a company twice for a model, got it with half the dimensions missing, did pixel measurements for the rest, made the 3d model and now i need to orient it and throw it back into a stock photo using the product plus our accessory
thanks
i actually have an irl friend now, it's kinda weird
otherwise i'm just really tall and awkward
i couldn't tell you a single thing about pretty much any presentation i ever watched
i dunno, i'm in a weird state right now
to fix it.
i could flip my loneliness to  smothered by far more attention that i could ever desire, lol
imagine the chaos that perfect possession would case in the world.
i appreciate the company though
on the other hand
very true.
how dare they only charge us 6% tax
new show: eyan 24/7
exactly
i'm also going to have learn to trust people again, lol.  i'm way too stubborn with wanting to do everything myself
eyan we already have the plans, you have only to tell me to <:doit:334014889137930240>
fair enough.  üòõ
what do i look like, a genius?
no worries.
have fun
not really, it missed a page
and scanned
not a half bad idea
i could also easily assist in that department
but if i start doing the weekly series, it could come into play
got some friends that are really good at it
how'd ya do?
film was fun,
is it a euphemism for fart or something idk butts dont usually giggle
people also complained that it took too long to cover a game, which, i mean, that could be arguably a fair critism
all hail bob ross
hopefully being a little older and wiser will make it easier this go round if i succeed again
you did this to yourself
crystal meth
with how the building is?
that isn't illegal either
heyah
maybe it's a sign lol
moving the solar system how far? it's kinda already in motion
no way
lower that to 5 too
guess who just got smash
compooter benig dumb ill do it in a minute
feels like its been 12/10 forever
i should just drop bot.js in the master branch of the repository and let everyone else figure out why it's there
the last thing is to write  my 3 minute speech about it
aaaaaaaaand this discord server is now at the top of my servers
yeah anyway homework bye
it's calculus lol
oh, it's mee6
don't worry flubs
yeah but is it quick and painless or is it slowly stop being able to breathe until all my muscles stop working and i lie there immobile as my brain stops
cuz id rather the first tbh
well, glas to know the tanuki leaf is called the super leaf in ultimate
mesothelioma has become a meme now
and i mean theres always the chance i get hit by a bus or burned at the stake for witchcraft or something
it's just on netflix
just as an fyi
just like seven deadly sins
oh i wasnt there today but im stuck_in_a_box_
it's be beautiful
also i lowered the shanty odds
and theres gotta be a maximum age for most people right? probably before you turn 12 if i had to guess
also here's a memefrom 2011
i mean my phone was a cheap 300 dollar samsung
that i paid 200 for
forknife has some problems but its the best one out there
what about like your spine or something
only dumb dogs
good job
what the crap cats
oh you meant like...ohh
the programming community should band together to destroy the evil
attempt mage
you know i realize i could log in on the school computer and not have to type on my phone
ive seen it. its pretty good
oh good
if youre not playing it now the answer is "not enough"
i have put quite a few other games on the  sd card, tho
i would have like that
~~but it can be better~~
what's new in your world?
that it is
ggez
wait crap when did it become 11 pm
why does it mention that you have the everyone role
how many
the rewind has over 9.9 million dislikes
help
i just did it
hooray for interpreted languages not making sure your variables are spelled right at compile time, because there is no compile time
whatever happens happens i guess lol
every day is christmas
how does one get a 100% in english
you should totally talk to us
honestly, not everybody should.  i've quickly learned that anybody can make a decent living even if they aren't smart.
it's funny because he's pink nu
he'll be fine then.  meanwhile, i'm sitting here thinking that i didn't have a job until 23 if you don't count youtube
i would consider it a job because you are/were making an income at one point which in my book sounds like what a job does lol
i'm tirrrrrred
falling asleep is an issue for me but so is waking up
also, yeah kugal, i guess it was technically a job, in fact a damn good one, but i feel like it did nothing for me in terms of developing skills i need for the normal workforce so now i'm playing catchup
depression's a big dumb fuck
thats an interesting way to look at it, i havent thought of that
and i don't want to be foolish and jump into something that's doomed to fail just because i feel lonely.
because i still feel like i acted wrongly, even if i just didn't have the right information to act
but i think when i got with collette, the mistake there was just not really thinking about what i needed out of a relationship
i like how you evaluate the consequences of waiting and not waiting, becuase that could be the very difference in making a final decision
as long as i like them for them im happy
yea i've always been in the mindset of it's better to wait, any attempt to wait to become older to fully commit in a relationship take that opportunity
i also know what i like
how dare the human race evolve in a way that promotes reproduction and the survival of the species.
or just is too screwy for my tastes.
4 hours away was tolerable, but that is definitely my limit moving forward.
im gonna brb, i should get ready to leave here for the bloody final
ah yes, that's kinda important
nah, i really am just looking to talk to people
if only walkthroughs for relationships existed, and ones that actually eorked amirite <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i think that‚Äôs all we can do
life requires and ungodly anount of patience
if you even know what your vision is
i don't have it down to a science, but as the years pass, i get better and better at knowing myself
honestly wouldn‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs highly dependent on the person
woah that's an essay to catch up on
except the dragonborn is life and you're alduin
she's definitely too good for me and she knows it
i mean, i'm honestly not opposed to mixing things up
if you don't start i'm gonna scan out every page of the drivers ed book i have somewhere and randomly send you pages
may have to
10k subs?
but for the record, i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm too good for anyone. quite the opposite
im back
yeah, arrogance
i mean, in all actuality, i have some confidence when i'm not depressed as hell
that would burn through healthy mental states like a forest fire through california
not the most appropriate timing there
sadly though i couldn‚Äôt live in any other state. california has pretty much got all that i need
i think so. it‚Äôs there enough for me to remember
or something like that
i prefer to look out upon the world and see death and desolation
there‚Äôs always full streets of parked cars here
and i'd say i'm not exactly a road rager, but bad driving is probably my biggest pet peeve
and then i will get one
and probably die
that was pretty nice
eyan, i‚Äôm sure you have a better chance than me in my area üòõ
its ok dragonite
dragonite, that wasn‚Äôt a dream. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
ew...
on the topic of warm temperatures
nothing is nicer than weather in the comfortable 50s on a nice autumn day
well, you are his creator
i don't know you well bella, but you seem like a good person.  i don't think the arrogance that rainy is displaying is appropriate, but i think you can feel good about yourself
ida your country is already skyrim
and the endless power struggles
wasnt that riverwood though
is there a good mod that lets you be a bard?
any female* single
i never used one but i know there was one bard mod that was pretty popular
and usually anything that popular was at least good if it was what you were looking for
huh, darn i would've been good for music lol
i'll have you know
haha good one master
i'm surprised you didn't question how full of shit i am right now, lol
that it is, thanks flubs
worst bot 0/10
what master said
either way pings will fly when it starts
oh crap then i'll be sleeping, oh well
wow how specific
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
i have the sudden urge to punch something <:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
well, i have just reached my state of boredom that i go through every year before christmas; all i can think about is the new games i will play afterwards and nothing i have now can keep me entertained
your small people are so hard to understand
no happiness allowed
let people ruin their lives in peace
i actually can't wait for the return.
why you cant go to college and also be successful? i mean you can but i dont see why youd put yourself at a four year, hundred thousand dollar disadvantage
yea..
master that is how you remove yourself from the gene pool
i cant get text to zoom in in my video editor even though ive specifically selected the option designated to do so, is this some weird windows shenanigans
but also, same. sadly
~~who?~~
i'm michael stevens
dont it though i mean if you got money you can get one of those cool hand freezing anti-death machines
between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes
screw you
you get that a, wouldn't want anyone getting d around here
maybe i removed it when i fixed the thing with the censor list not working
<:gwqlabsthonkery:398950779769061376>
i have like a 4 gb card for my 3ds
yeah the censor list doesnt work
i feel like you do
text or call your grandma
huh.
oh, who am i kidding, of course you don‚Äôt
to obad im already 2200 messages behind for that
given that outoftouchtube is owned by google
now the only thing i send outbound email for is calling my sister dumb names
how were you not already using gmail
you too huh?  üòõ
afterward it goes back to normal style
the end product is the same and it lowers costs
cows that exercise taste better btw
well you can ask him about it when hes available and brew your thoughts together until then
you want to keep talking about this?
mcdonalds doesnt really care if their meat tastes a little worse
what'd i miss
it should probably care if the meat gets contaminated and they have to recall and check large samples for disease
who decides that's a good idea though sharing blood is the source of like half the non-malaria diseases in the history of forever
but probably no because theres no way this is gonna become a problem in my lifetime
do i want to go in for my last final or just sleep
also surprisingly doing ok despite getting up before 4:30 today
actually it doesnt but thats still an awful lot
how low do you want price
brad is this what you do for fun
mood.
then it'd kill me though
well i know that 8.2/40 is around 20% prolly closer to 21% so you couldntve done 5 times better but definitely did more than 4.75
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
dragonite why does a highway need to own islands?
3:30-9:30
want the audiobook?
i think my transcripts get updated tomorrow
you‚Äôre definitely thinking about it a lot then
0.0 stephen is doing a weird thing with the ending song atm on stream
there
good job kugals
you get
my final english grade is 98.2% lol
the midterm was like 90% multiple choice with just one short response  it should have been graded by the computer
same honestly
thanks <:pogchamp:305560024443518986>
my weapon is bad memes
i think it's the steel typing
hey remember in like fourth and fifth grade when we'd get like five things for homework and the teacher would have all of it graded by like the next morning
it turned a samsung galaxy into a grenade.
and whatever other fucking shit that counts as a character
you‚Äôd still get the best thing and use those buttons for others anyway
and ive heard good things about those pocket monster games
i think theres one in the house in solitude that starts the whole thing
skarm is god
brb gonna go talk to her
why madagascar?
oh right
lol if you want to
hmm it's 10:30 and ive gotten nothing done i brb
boobs are more fucking sensitive than me the morning after an alcohol bender
that's ok
i guess that may be the benefit of college
just turn it into a snowflake with editing magic
master these are your people or something
i wasnt on the ssformus
which equally is not a benefit at all
dragonite42 :::)))))
oooooooo
as in my major?
i'm the vb2 dragonite
it's a little rough but it's not like i'm doing anything else with my pitiful existence so may as well.
just gotta use a bit of algebra slight of hand and u substitution and bam its super doable
no matter how well i do on the final in one of my classes my grade will go down
the answer is why.
i'm close to a level up so that's mainly why i'm here lol
do i continue skyrim even though i‚Äôve played a lot today o
is that wrong
at my school it was a 65 or below was failing and you only could go on to the next class in a series if you got at least a 73
it would seem that way
i'm down to my last brain, if that one explodes then, well i'm shutting down until my next brain get's fixed
this shit needs the right setup
lots of new people
a reder red lol
but mr stabby is a snowman
yeah
let's burn it
same thing
hey, i can only afford 7 brains alright
tomorrow can't be easter because easter falls on a sunday
then i'll throw a triangle
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
kinda lame, i wanted the car alarm to go off
yeah i thought skull kid would be one of the newcomers
both
i wouldn't be angry obviously, just don't care
everyone else that has a chance is just i don't care really
yeah square is really stingy
i'm more inclined to play ff6 than 7
watch as the dlc pack for crono only has 1 song in it if he's a character lol
yeah and still only 2 songs
i'd love to see banjo in the game, but i'm not holding hope for it even with microsoft being all for the idea
and universal is owned by comcast iirc which is a competitor to disney
i really don't know who else they could choose
so yeah <:coerip:508432005038342174> that character
and well
there's also the fact that they would not add an echo unless it's a two-for-one deal, and each will give us only one fighter
tmw your robot has friends and you don't
dovahkiin or doomguy
though metal gear rising would make for a better point of reference because platinum games
for some reason, the 21st always had weird sentimental value to me for absolutely no real reason but i forgot about it this year
one day i‚Äôll find my birthday twin
it makes sense actually. i think i‚Äôm the same way, but i had an earlier birthday than i was supposed to but i don‚Äôt know the date of that
paving your own path is the dream
*plays the ‚Äúi hate people‚Äù song from spongebob* this should be my theme song
lets not
you can catapult yourself ahead a lot faster if you get a good one
everyone did
i have pirouettes which are a close 2nd
or at least well enough to enjoy venting his frustrations on fictional characters by brutally murdering them?
an ethically questionable career
it honestly annoys me even as someone who has never played their games
i see that, it's okay though, i won't ignore your ass
i imagine that line will now go in the bot also, lol
oh joy, apps are always unnescessarily long
nice
nice
i'm not even going to ask questions in risk of getting snapped to dust
e!google ask reddit hangover tips
flubs you're a wonderful person who's going to live a long and happy life
but still, i just didnt get any joy from it.
i think it's supposed to be a glass of water per drink
r34lol is great but has become infested with kda
he did it
hai friends ^w^
most people forgot about the meteos situation within two weeks, so it kinda is
i frequently forget rall exists
ohh....
i dont understand, why are there people that find underage anime girls attractive?
i mean, i'm not fine, but i'll be fine, i think
do you exercise regularly?
neither am i
i think i have an unhealthy obsession with this overcoat
and i have a soda machine in our lunch room but i've been cutting back
i‚Äôve had three coffees this week. am i a stereotypical adult yet
i also forgot where my box was so i lost my debit card as well
anyways food is here peace
nice
what is wrong with me
they'll get over it
it's a floating island how hard can it me
tis that cold time of the year
id say theres the effective solution of making all claimed content private but theres too many alternative uploads available
ahhh
today's was about cats
why didnt you just attend them when they were live
greetings, animal\_man\_.
ive never understood that expression. like i get you *can* kick yourself but why. it doesnt even hurt
cheese

yeeeaaaaaahhhhhhh
music to my ears
thank you for listening to my speech
switch things up
it was beautiful
magus9000 fainted!
i mean youd assume as much
i mean, you are kinda a dork
"blow me" -eyan
well
she's just going to recite the entire library of babel
i do want to do that
that's a terrible reason for casual sex
oh that
honestly yeah
what are the main memes of 2018
otherwise
you got that pretty spot on
i'm just depression drinking to ignore the fact i'm spending christmas entirely alone
i've never been so complimented and intrigued at once
i'm not eating there
in statistics you always round to the even number
i don't have time i just make it by putting off things that are actually important
but cool
get fallout 4
based on the context, you
what are we fucking?
cool
i was distracted
<:ironic:307345212328509442>
kings orders
merry christmas eve, ya nerds
the rest being days off from work, partying with your friends, and watching gladiatorial events
of course you did
magfest is a 3.5 day event so on any given day there's a 1% chance that i'll be at magfest
have fun, don't break anything
oh i have some time rn, time to scan out the driving rules book and start bothering bella with that
*me starts harmonizing* who lives who dies who tells your story
music and gaming festival
it's the main day in some countries
ironically missed the ping because i was playing sims 3
all driving speeds will be in m/s
i like how the modern internet just lets you google strings of six words and instantly find out who said them
nice
yummy
it's a sheogorath quote
i'm pretty sure we lose like four one-millionths of a second per year or something
its the one people want the most of
so today i was playing my drums, with my phone bluetooth connected to my headphones and then when i decided to stop playing i dropped the phone onto a drum, and it landed onto one of th tension rods in the worst possible way ever
the clone wars
that‚Äôs the exact lyrics where i thought it‚Äôd go bad, actually
like one day the charger port just decided to lose any and all grip
point b
well you can be alive on the outside and dead on the inside
no the answer is boston because one train breaks down
that
something something westbound train 70 mph something something eastbound 10 mph faster something something when will they meet
i can't talk
sheogarth - guru of madness
mine may have a second one, but with the only angle i'm viewing it from, it'd be impossible to see
i'm on data
it's always an experience
(unless you‚Äôre west coast, lmao)
the twelve days of christmas?
do we have ninja turtles?
ginormigantuan difference
excuse you
i thought mine was missing a few vowels
id join but im calling my friend
flubs
at least send him to the right channel
i could say whats on my mind right now, but i'll save it for when he's sober <:lul:305559915714576385>
first of all you didnt die, yet.
nice
he‚Äôs a baby so most of them are blurry as heck
it came to me

<:roopog:442070287769403402>
happy crimas friend
ok nice
they have coffee. i am sleepy. it‚Äôs also almost eleven. it‚Äôs probably not worth
she is
other than that one time
shes into kinky shit
<:gwnonexmaikasmug:402867199825674251>
it‚Äôs still only christmas #1 tho
merry christmas
so my average day for the past year consists of 7:51 of sleep, 3:20 warframe, 2:39 school, 1:40 with eyan, 1:36 with family, 0:57 on homework, 0:37 in the car, 0:36 on reddit, and everything else is bellow half an hour so its inaccurate
christmas merry
happy christmas exclusively to those who dont celebrate
id join and sing but my throat is missing
i might pop into the stream later when my family is not here and i actually have peace and quiet
cakeonator
underwhelmed
i‚Äôm a baconator
i'm just gonna stay in call while playing ffxiv
nice
that one definitely counts
good lord you people are still in voice?

santa's stand is jesus?
okay, ,christmas party in vc.
so you got 3.4 years

nani

panic mode activate
look
ruined the grading curve
i win???
rise up
duel me
they don‚Äôt reach a peace, that‚Äôs alright
time to get some pistols and a doctor on site
you have him turn around so he can have deniability
you pay him in advance, you treat him with civility
oh god
it was amazing
oops?
honestly, i'm stupid proud of that timing
i'd say it was that he was announced as the first dlc of the fighter packs, even at such a big event no less
how can men be so fucking dense
i am a goddess
at any given chance
are you calling eyan stupid
it's a mess
if eyan had infinite density shouldn't we all be accelerating towards pittsburgh at infinite speed
depends on starting location and end destination
yes danit
fuck you
i'm in school, so that's where it's spent
oh my
so like
not rn
panda can‚Äôt math
i‚Äôll try to. i haven‚Äôt played in a while
like what the fuck
tsa broke a $400 prop
eyan, go to mag with me, i'll cosplay star guardian ahri
weird, me too
eyan
we can‚Äôt hear you. at least i can‚Äôt
hear who
all of my attraction
ehhh
i'm just drunk
oh im stupid
it's one of those big neckhole ones
thanks! hope you all have a good day
no thanks lol
you're just noticing?
how do you think i'm getting that cosplay bod
eyan
nerds
considering i dn't die of hangove
you know you love it, babe
reminds me of infintie hover in jak 2/3
panada. do i have you on steam
wow, eyan just called me cute
we killed him
no clue how it works tho so rip lol
i wasn't here when that happened
also she's your age, i'll introduce you, she also loves gamers rise up and prequel memes and warframe and is about your age
holy fuck
supposedly i havent joined the steam group before now lol
honestly, 9k has filled much better role of god than any christain god has
how dare you assume assumptions
what is sleep
fuck
you always do, babe
awww
dumb
heed
scream
you like drunk me?
he's dumb
did you see that density chart
nighty
considering the amount of alcohol
master got sent to the gallows
i think she wants to blow me or something, unfortunately, i'm more dense than a black hole so i'm not really sure
oh everyone's gone
haven't gone on any this month, probably a good idea to go burn off the like 4000 calories of booze anythe 300 calories of christmas dinner
why do you say that? did you steal $11 from me?
i probably will soon enjoy, i fucking love hiking
i am a cheap date for real, i look for the chicken on the menu and order like the cheapest thing, if not a salad
i got an electric blanket for christmas and it has helped wonderfully to alleviate cold
7% but i'll ignore it on rainy's behalf
lol, i know i'm weird
you seemed to be quite interested at one point in time
sure
gimme a sec, i gotta get back in character
also eww
you're right
it's okay, i am too
i mean, you could be like rainy, she's interesting, but it cost her her soul
being that awesome doesn't come free
please don't, lol
nevermind
oh, so we're role playing now
i mean
enlighten me, why?
it's such a bother to have to keep turning all caps on and off
my response to it is "yeah, you like that you fucking retard"
rainy said this [2:01 pm] thy queen, zealots: you can just yelll at me, i'm into it
fair enough
r/askreddit i assume?
same, they feel like a waste of time
there was some story on reddit about things people accidentally said during sex and that story blew up and went full scale meme
they probably won't, just saying, that's the kind of thing where all it takes is that one asshole to screw it all up
i don't call him that, master is a... reserved term for me
where'd my queen go?
i was wondering who you were referring to
so just as a warning, dont get mad if it is very stupid
thank you my queen
don't worry, i can definitely get more mad
yeah, for once i agree with eyan
all of em
are eyan and rainy dating?
you'd have to be some eyan levels of dense
gonna need you to explain that one to me
she just likes fucking with me
does it ever not?
that's not how being dense works
this day is draggin
also you only got what, 2 hours left
normally it's like 40-50 minutes depending on how fucked i get, but it should be 30 tops today
dumbass
unfortunately
what a tragedy
look
and rome wasn't built in a day, i know all too well that looking beautiful takes time
that's how i felt yesterday, but i think that's just called  a hangover
i blame rainy
new year new me
i'm capable of trying
pfft, that's up to your discretion
just gotta gimme the word to release it
obviously
of a useless goddess?
e!google glass of water
rainy only shared one of the two cat pics
so do i, i built a youtube channel off of it
what's the least ajit part of florida?
who's being dense now
don't ruin my fantasy eyan
should we document dragonite as an scp
wait
if you must specify a playable race, probably balgruuf the greater
who is the hottest male character in skyrim?
yeah that
you won't stop me from handling you sexually? wow, truly a scholar and gentleman
i can make any cosplay for any body, given enough... experience with said body
why would i not be?
there are quite a lot of medical students though
hmmm
picky, are we?
nice
people like complaining more than money duh
we have children?
technically i'm referring to my ap system, not windows
i didn't even know we were dating let alone that far into things
hmmm
i get the pc
i miss a lot when i‚Äôm busy working and not being here ·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
"rainy - guru & queen of ass"  something like that?
(dont worry the hard drives will be incinerated)
a-sofs
but i dont know if i could handle that responsibility
i ain't eyan's s tuff
highly effective
oh look, rainy is finally understanding how i became more dense than a black hole
me right now
well, it's up to her, lol
what were your expectations?
you're good at drawing a bunch of scribbles and pretending they're instructions
i wanted to go to prom, but
alcohol?
same
ill get the flamethrowers
a lot of people look back at high school with at least *some* degree of fondness
but i wanna dance
oh wait that's for the smoking campaign
that was worth it
plot twist, i was gay all along
fuck all that
now see what you did
btw, 9k, set our permissions for the voice channels to include anything prehistoric frog and above
and thus rainy cried
no idea what you're talking about but okay
hmm?
i never would have guessed from the name
what's with you and baconators?
imagine being assassinated by someone who uses a knife and fork for their pizza
steam apparently understands me
it recommended a game called boobs saga
probably
so it was _you_ who sent me the free trial of playboy magazine?
you dont have to give us an exact number, just the data type that would be required to store them
i'm sorry
huh, maybe i don't have you beat then, technically i only have 3 but i had a fourth that was close
cause if we're going with one date, then, uhhh... lol
and i can just go back though my google account that i use for tindr contacts
i'm here to shine bright and bring everyone else down with me
yeah but with even more ways to start an explosion
like all over the damn place
i sort of always imagined rainy is the personification of a nuclear bomb
the deepest emotional connection i've had heretofore...
i'd say she needs to aim
well i'm not
how depressing do i wanna get with this?
no swearing.
i don't wanna build emotional connections with anyone
backup brains, i burned through 3 of them in my theory final yesterday
probably wise

everything
my two year+s with men permanently scarred me (one literally) and my year+ with a girl is still my friend
the heart wants to beat
therefore brain is stupid
but on the other hand the brain gave us video games
that sounds like a problem that can be taken care of at a later point in time
stop
i type, send, and than ignore
i mean i wouldn't have put it past me to have sent a few to random people by accident
you should send them to random foreign emails
i mean
keep it on
play smash bros.
because you complain about being tired
i'm calling you fucking stupid
not brilliant
so you're tired you say?
you were
that's me falling out of my chair
but we can't test that theory
clearly
<:roodab:509458870700212235>
i ain't picky
lets get it
so it works out
lmfao
shall i spam it
<:roodab:509458870700212235>
good shit girl
so it doesnt really matter
i dunno, next summer
eyan
more or less
but it wouldn't be authentic
but alas
hmm, i'll move to st catharines, seems like my kind of city
i just wanna live in canada
no promises
what kinda breakfast do you prefer?
alright, fine, i'll take the pic after i make you breakfast, if you're clothes aren't on by then you're a lazy fuck
wait no
but eyan
oh right it's still not magfest
probably not
i never had a soul to being with
yo wtf
you will not escape coffee
fair
nice
hear me out
tim horton's is üëå
none of them are talos
yo right
unless it was just a jebait
okay artemis and aphrodite are actual gods so props to you for using actual gods
but not my god
actually isaac brock
empire loves lists
move everything else down a step
me or 9k?
so a clean 10 now ok
that last name is neat
the christians are so boring with one jackass
no offense to any christians in here but your religion robbed me of the first 16 years of my life
this one sounds like a party
even thought mike is still alive
and jack daniels
that stuff is just... no
to make a molotov with?
making a molotov without vodka is heresy
wait you mean it's possible?
so the vip we picked up is now talking about various religions to my dad
pffft
yeah it is better the vip is roasting dad's bad management
doesnt sound like anything new
whos the manager?
wait panda is?
he wants anything
power of what?
my ego
please
i will add on another dirnk to what i owe you
flubs
anywhere
megumin, put her close to but below me
also hi friends lol ^w^
hiya will
that scale tho lol
thanks deci and panda for setting the curve
i work in a hispanic restaurant
i am aroused
ok rain
can you fill this out
precesely
it's a metroidvania hack n slash
and the 100%+ percent come from things outside of the game universe
fidget killed god
that's the only material i know on top of my head cause it sounds like weed
rude
thats less than not productive
hell yeah
but i keep sitting in discord and staring into space
time is math
it's the goddamned skyrim engine
time off means memory decay
it has a purpose
integral of y dx
should be fired
i doubt she remembers half the names
just integrated one of the craziest functions, got this as the answer lul
not much, you?
and i can‚Äôt fall back asleep because i‚Äôm hungry
uh ok then
i'm much more at home in inkscape than gimp, but i'm learning, i think.
and i told you to go the fuck to sleep
oh, so we want to debate semantics of what is possible vs what is justified?
that's deep
that's another large point in the "pros" column
fuck off mee6
i wish it was time for lunch
i love the genre though so i'll never not like metroidvania
also hi ida, i played your gift on stream last night
the number one reason i want smash is to play castlevania, lol
he'd be way too op
i figured the end of the year would suck for this job, but god does it suck
yeah, and?
when that shit comes around i'll have to settle for not actual nerds cause all the actual nerds will be fucking their computers
i'm just depressed
ooh, yummy.
i mean, milk chocolate is fine if it's what you desire
wow 9k, i've never seen someone on here have such a correct opionion
dark chocolate is where it's at
you're wrong on the grounds that you annoy me
dark chocolate reflects the bitter, stygian nature of my soul. i have a connection to it that spans the eons
also, who the fuck spends 1609.58 on a 100 napkins
he's just dumb, he doesn't know what he's saying
we shall rest when we are dead
this kingdom doesn't actually have rules against any type of death
you see the trick is to do that before you leave the shower
try harder
~~they love each other~~
this is too lewd
how's saturday at 6 sound?
pardon me, i am as dense as the entire universe packed into a tiny spec of spacetime right before the big bang
my place
you want her to give you a not dumb reason?
real life is dragging me out of my coffin
imma take an aside to say i have a great butt.
i just had the anime scenario of trying desperately to get my new jeans over my butt
that's cause you're stupid
and the reading is a nice one that i usually have to cram into a few hours so this will be a nice change of pace if done right
sounds like it‚Äôs doable at least
mmmmm
listen here you little shit
quadruple doesn‚Äôt seem like enough
i mean, i got a b
but in high school, that was failing for me
oof no reminders about gpa
but i had just over 1500 on sat and 34 on act
so applying for schools is fun
not really, i didn't try that hard, lol
but i don‚Äôt remember much of any spanish
took one, did fuckall on the english and essay portions, somehow got 1440
my condolences rc
hope so
english however, required 4 credits. so, you had to take one every year
why would i though?
eyan
mmk, that's acceptable
kinky
i have no siblings, but i look forward to fucking with my cousins in the same way
my restaurant already has a well designed site, unfortunately
oh yeah that works
but the pixel count
it's in the show
the blonde's outfit on my desktop is one of the cosplays i have now
cause i feel like that should be prerequisite to meeting me
driving trip continues, i'll be there at like 1
for like, everyone
any chance you could get me the thor "does he...?" meme
that one?
maybe
i expect nothing less
if the rapture happened would it resemble the snap?
even the bot hates me
curiosity expands the known data set to expand a search for potential patterns which can in the long term simplify the work necessary to get a desired answer
how many people sailed out into the unknown and were never heard from again before one managed to find a new land?
yeah, we're all just sentient links in a very long chain of evolution. the way we sway will have an impact on the future for others
sure it does
sure having them around is great for then and there but that impact is limited. if that group does manage to find somethi- this is the part where i realize i have no idea where i'm going with this
being curious is an emotion, emotion is illogical
something about elon musk wanting to have other companies put him out of business
are we planning on re-implementing the naughty words censor or something
actually it doesnt
that's a topic for down the road
also master im disappointed you did not save fus go fuck yourself
fair enough
what is a man
hmmm
in a good way or a bad way
doesnt automatically invalidate them all
eyan isnt it past your bedtime
that's what curiosity gets you
wait that happened?
if you ever think you did something stupid, just remember, at some point in human history someone decided to squeeze a cow's udders to see what happened _and it caught on_
and are they still alive
do you have any data on how often questions in this server actually end with question marks
what is a man
so one to one reply to valid conditions should be fine
some people are into that
jesus is into drinking blood
you mean tomato juice right
it's symbolic ya ninny
>for 10 million, i think my wife would be there cheering me on.
nice
ok so yesterday you defined who was in the pantheon
well i'm out until later, so it'll have to wait
i have stuff to do for the next hour or so
by the 8
ask about the most obscure thing possible
eyan it's just an array chill
also fuck the thalmor too
no, no, fuck that presumptive and pretentious piece of human filth
hey that wasn't nice squid
nice ping time
most of the time
hmm it magically came back
this is a good one to start with
i never let it get that close, i'm always 4 points ahead
when does the day start?
you live
chocolate chip?!
so does string theory
go for it
but reading the room, that may not be best
yeah just mix booze with snowberries, moon sugar, and frost salts
yeah
i'm okay
just reeeee
don't underestimate my power
we're playing for second place
but he doesn't have to be up
cards against humanity isnt a game you play to win. its a game you play to make as many dark jokes as possible
eyan you're ok with boring
they have really good chais
i can't wait to go crash at eyan's hotel whenever he's working night audit
i mean, you're invited if you want ida
haven't we all?
too tired?
and bloody marys
i was a daytime bartender at 17
i mean....
cause you said $25 a month
except on sundays
if someone gets hurt, that's an assault charge
oh i can assure you
do you though?
but eyan
i could just what?
pay attention to me
am i not worth the effort?
pancakes/breakfast in general
so i love em
preference of hair color
when i get pink nu i get a dab emoji
<:treason:396483914803445761>
sipho dias is the real mvp

blob:null/24c29de3-9b1e-4a3a-802d-469d552825e2
i'm not your queen, i am the queen
i kinda want to join the call
so presumptive
if you think i'll forget this... this indignance
"are you having a fucking chuckle" -rainy rn
good place
depends on the day
yeah, she'll be my cat soon enough
oh uhhh
a solid one
go to the store sometime this week
alright glhf
cold
i‚Äôm just glad i have today off. but i probably won‚Äôt be able to take a nap for a little while
i am when i want to be
so, never?
i kinda wish i was at work right now, so much regret will be had tonight
that was a very fitting response actually
around here at least
i finally got a new keyboard
think of all the pretty things you can buy me
why did he design malaria
but i get tired of playing it in long spurts >.>
they have icons

i'm never bored
i'm never bored, just attention starved
guess who just spent three hours building a house in terraria
speaking of sleep, i must do that now

step one: try to diversify with multiple woods used
4tn1te
thonk
she just wants me to call her mommy
i got myself bloodstained today
earth prolly
which happened to permeate like 1.5 states
you call that nicely
she was giving pieces of information and i wanted to have it all mapped out nicely
i call that a clusterfuck
my critics are... usually shortlived
i was distracted scp readings
better.
im out of coffee...
what will cup of java give you
is it better than regular coffee?
i've still got 4 hours and 35 minutes
yeah thats right skarm

"no it's pennsylvania"
good job

or did you get half as much sleep as you intended
wouldnt the light from the screen hurt his eyea
did anybody else ask?\
i'm just watching castlevania videos to pass the time, so yes
there are a bunch of people who tell me it's good, should i submit to defeat and join them?
those are full too
just buy another hard drive
hmm should i join stream or get things done for the first time since forever
lmao he started singing in another server so it continues here
i'm gonna buy a suite so that i can cook shit... though i don't think gaylord suites have ovens... hmmmmm
what do you even do at conventions
d&d is probably something i'd love, yet have never touched
have you ever eaten at the sports bar thing inside the gaylord? every time i dropped by the wait time was like an hour long
also ida, oh honey
i will host d&d&d in my room at mag
how sweet of you
oh wait wrong thing
nice
that's next year
other than maybe disappointment
i mean, i have no expectations for you
i have class again on monday and really not looking forward to it
i had classes today running off 3.4 hours
thanks quitcorrect
scan?
also is that new profile pic from a comic?
....what
considering the one you just asked doesnt
parents franchise documents for who is going to what events and who's paying how much
i scan hundreds a month
you think scanning 14 pages is bad
just like me
i'm so sad i missed out on the peak of vr chat
it was fun seeing him
scanning is easy when youre able to stand
i like sleep, dunno why i tried to get as little sleep as possible for so long
oh wait i know why
pi vpn
i dunno, however much force it takes to stop ~50kgm/s of momentum
then that depends on how long it took
fast reaction time and immediate stop to forward momentum
nerd
yo that name is cursed
don't you do it
well welcome back, bac. we missed you.
maybe one n
i find it weird how i can rename myself in literally every other server i‚Äôm in but it‚Äôs restricted in this one
i agree
i find that actually to be wrong
like i dont get whats up with that
i remember watching that damned pokemon pearl playthrough
how much can i cuss
to test the system
i was gonna test it out
literal scan. gg
also the system is mildly broken right now so yuo really dont want to test it
not as rarted
how do you play skyrim
you think skarm ever works?
but like minus 500 hours
that is a pretty awesome avatar, lol
it was my compliment first <:gwaobapepecry:395628671911854081>
also hey there new friend
don't bring jesus into this
to quote eyan from earlier today, " you're not my mother"
ok skarm take a few steps back

oh, congratulations
oh no, it's a terrible thing

<:gwfateesip:392307687955628034>
and i'm not sure, but i can say *i* haven't bit you.
ooh fun
victorian
i love night shifts
whatever its called. sounds great
is that a thing now
oh ok
it's the uv radiation of the sun that's the issue
uv radiation
not uv light
it does, but in miniscule amount
hopefully
can i just live inside of an x-ray machine
well you aren't allowed to be sad
hello gambit but with boobs
constantly be blasted with radiation
valid
no no
according to the song
i love d&d i just wish i had more spare time to play
by putting down the things he doesn't like
you can run short games periodically or just once a week. or if you got the time and energy full 15 hour games
i recently just finished a campaigng
i feel personally attacked
honestly, i just don't have time and other people for tabletop gaming nowadays. aside from the rare instance that i do.
with discord and roll20, for example
i ruin everything :)
what else does it say
so, play read dead or hear eyan preach more about investment banking <:thinkingsteps:396534879833292810>
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
stream.
rather unfortunate indeed
you mean almost by "all 3 were nearly killed" or "the number of children i have killed is approaching 3"?
i just hate all kids
i woke up at 11 pm
astrophysicist carl sagan?
i can
skarm shut up
half the time that's when i end up going to sleep
what happened to wolverale?
oh right, eyan‚Äôs birthday is today
i'm assuming that's there as a joke, considering candyman is the only with it.
just now?
<:kappaclaus:520412032042926080>
> fault
thats right, "always"
at the very least, i hope we get a mini direct like last january
no they are not
yeah, skam
so all of us are free to abuse your bot then, since he did it to us first
i don‚Äôt know actually
are you feeling okay? that sounds awfully low
we are
also am i the only one who finds it weird how someone would want to avoid knowing about dlc content
just a thought
hmmmm
other way around here, sleepy but not tired
so go ahead
every day is master's birthday
i am lonely, i am gay, i have depression
that was a very heavy "uhh"
the only reason i'm here is because eyan is
yes you are
skarm say brb
what am i saying
its for your own good
he just admitted it more or less, lol
nah, just depressed
its just a matter of doing it
noted
is that am or pm
uh....retail :)
do you work in the loading bay
i did that for a few days and basically ceased existing
this has probably been posted here before but i can‚Äôt be bothered to look through the few months of stuff i‚Äôve missed so here
yeah flubs is
ooos it‚Äôs one
hate it how that just kinda happen s
didn‚Äôt feel like it at all
oh yeah thats me
i ws going to make a joke but i decided against it
im bad at type
im not a fan of onions
i am mostly just fond of them on burgers
pretty much try every food at least thrice
well next 4 hours
the point is to get drunk i dont care what it tastes like
i didn't ask about taste lol
when i *do* care about what it tastes like, ive got ~300 bottles of wine in a cooled storage locker
eyan says he can give you a dick if you want one
god i hate children
your hope dies suddenly instead if being dragged out and slowly bled out
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
the first pokemon ash is shown to have is a voltorb
idaaaaaaaaa ive been listening to people talk about d&d all weekend and i really wanna play but i cant sit still for that long
in the show
woke up to see star wars on. nice
i think a game crashing on a loading screen is better than it just loading forever
genius
when we start doing annual zeal meetups we can play for a few hours each time
that‚Äôs fair.
i'd have to go with switch
because the earlier ones could also play ps2 games
this is quite the predicament
get the gpu of the ps4 and cpu/ram of the switch, then you can play both
oh yeah that one too
that's also still dependent on what p5r actually is. it might just be a racing game for all we know.
nice
you guys wanna waste more time with league?
currently not home, so i would join later
thats why im waiting for the netflix version of the cw shows
20 is not bad.
i mean, we spend time more on games yknow?
that‚Äôs the point, i like seeing people‚Äôs reaction when it‚Äôs going on
bloons
~just rewatch the crossover all summer~
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
i‚Äôve only seen it a couple times... its not even about the game.
i get to into movies
oh hey it‚Äôs back on
except for 2015
not gonna lie the only game i want on swich is smash
ps4 is also entering its last few years until sony releases its successor. which would most likely be backwards compatible
so far the games i‚Äôve played on pc don‚Äôt do as much for me as console games have
oh yay a ps4 vote. thanks arkada
did somebody say miku?
i have
look at his sub animation
never thought of it
can i share them in this chat?
oh yeah you missed thsi thing
oh my god
it also may have been spillover from dc
yes eyan
i have a miku print somewhere but all my past con stuff is kind of just shoved away waiting to actually be displayed one day
dat essay though
and that is my second essay for the day thank you
its just lazy walking
all the important places are nearby
"empty" streets are nice
i like where i'm at, cause it gives me the peace i desire but i'm close enough to a city that at least has stuff to do if i ever desired it
rush hour kills 20 minutes on my drive home compared to normal
we have to drive 25-30 minutes to do anything
and you arent taxiing across the city if you live there
the midwest is not even close to an accurate representation of where i live, lol
steal the silverware for yourself, then
i enjoy cities when it comes to visiting but not when it comes to living. i will never live in a city
i take it that the midwest is no longer high noon land
no thats rainy's go word
however
disaster
is it that, or a natural godsend?
im like part of tornado alley tho
yeah, northeast is good for dodging natural disasters, the worst ya get is snow
where i live our biggest concern is tornados
that one just really hates new york
yeah but new orleans isnt even that big
wacky? really?
also we're pretty good at moving a lot of people around quickly
true, there aren't just roads in new york. there's also the subway system
the more south they are, the worse they are.
return of the jedi is now starting
well that's not really anything new for hurricanes in general
ah, return of the jedi, what a classic
i dont know what youre talking about
lol rip
yeah
those maps they show you in school are all wrong
also birds arent real and the moon is a myth
satorl marsh is probably the butt tbh
wait a sec
i'm never too drunk for investment banking
well that is just rude
oh they're long gone.
i mean, why wouldn't i defend you, lol
why do people ever feel like that?
so yes i agree that brawl has the best music
they probably just felt like being dicks
i've got one open, currently
sounds like a plan to me
rainy have you ever piloted an automobile
same as g
though with working at a hotel, i feel eyan has more available
understandable
i don't know if i'll be able to negotiate what g is getting for night audit, but i can hopefully at least bump my wage up a buck and maybe a little extra if i'm lucky
cant you just get more out of candyman?
i can get him to stop if you want
i certainly pay dividends though.
one day
you make a compelling argument
i'd like to think that eyan knows better
eyan knows a good relationship will be an expensive one regardless
but you can still think of all the really pretty things you could buy me.
eww fries
so shoestrings over steak?
ever had a gretan, arakda?
one if my favorite con memories is having an older japanese man teach me how to properly and safely tie up my partner in bed üòä
i'll see if i can find one.
to be fair, i wouldn't want to watch last jedi again anyways, lol
ughhhhh
i'm never bored
i do it for rey
so i'm at less than 15 in the past 72, why god. why?
cutting out the parts with finn probably would‚Äôve helped
i agree demon lord, i'd much rather have abrams back
i'm just glad that j.j. abrams is directing episode ix
i'm sure a lot of the critics who loved it were paid by disney lol
i don‚Äôt usually hear why the prequels were bad
the fuel is what matters
i forgot that‚Äôs a thing here
do u mean gratin
if i recall correctly rainy paid $10 for that
same
that it is
i just wish i had more outlet's. since my pc/internet has been a bust for months all i have is my laptop. so i'm very limited on what i can do. im tired of watching movies, anime, youtibe videos. i'm bored and sad. not a good combo tbh
you want to get more out of what little free time you have?
oh it is, i've enjoyed playing through the world of light
by almost an hour
they should have ryan reynolds cameo in dc and starwars movies
that's a good way to just delete free time
a character that was on screen long enough for me to recognize her, then the entire planet blew up.
have you tried stardew valley?
neet
jeez 9k, it's like you aren't even mlg lvl 30 in btd5 *or* btd6
rude
what?
yeah we dont talk about that one
i didn‚Äôt read it tho
ooh congrats
<:gwoiczenthink:390299938250293250>
go outside or something <:kappa:374346980136058893>
did he go get a drink
last time it took 9 mins before she left
chief is microsofts mario
not even on pc yet
nobody would expect that now
we can make a night of it
it's an echo fighter for lucina
non-stop
he is competitively ciable
eyan has been popping a lot of bloons
yes he does
but one you play him
he's b tier
of who the third character might be
piranha plant, joker, and -redacted-
xenoblade chronicles' composer did a remix of gangplank galleon and it's nnnnnnnnnnffff
yeah
i know i am but what are you, eyan
oh ok
with two games so far
also again
wow did they even try
dark pit is s tier
a "cosplay"
eyan
she's hotter than you remember
excuse me for my french but
i played a fair amount of link too
my queue is bugged
also
hello
iowa is in central
by at least two hours
oh damn
i have terrible taste in men apparently
if i knew why i was sad
anytime you want
butts are better
what's up lol ^w^
you have some low spec games to play?
same lol
ooooh they have the watchmen movie on netflix. i havent seen it and wish i realized that three hours ago
plus i enjoy typing
i didn't know when my last save was, but it was only ~15 minutes
rainy i gotta warn you
bella i thought you were like, 18 lol
nope
i think that is the ultimate way to catch your attention. just yell "boobs" out in public and bam eyan appears like "yooo"
which co-worker?
darn it, stay in place
i havent watched robocop
just a hunch
no the suit is what makes them look pretty
majestic heres the actual spoiler part for someone who isnt familiar with the game at all: then the infestaiton made the minds of the warframes basically non-existent so then the tenno transferenced into them
that sleep schedule tho o.o
night bella ^w^
did you just call me candy dan
don‚Äôt call me dan, dan
you are saying
i've killed people for less
which means it's perfect advertising for it
"oh yeah lets release prime hunters shortly before prime 3 and then do fucking nothing with anything we did in that game"
who do you guys play as
this is a fucking wild prediction considering that game was...well, kinda shit in comparison to the rest of the prime series
wait all the hunters are alive
since hunters took place between prime 1 and 2
here's hoping no executive meddling happens. it looks like samus will make a full recovery from being on hiatus.
i now see why it is rated t
skarm is retarded
that second part was uncalled for
the oversear
nay.. like a horse?
id let a stranger fuck me for 10m
~~she probably bribed eyan~~
but i guess anything is a dildo if you're brave enough
paid for a house with sex
cause like, then that's a triple win
i mean... its not like they have to watch it
hmmmm
and if i could get my partner involved in it, it's like a win-win-win-win
just answer once for yes, once for no
just be single forever like me
glad we cleared that up
did not mean to dc lol xd
alright
that speech class is as hectic as i expected
i said everyone, not everything
it‚Äôs only not creepy if the standing person is hitchhiking. it‚Äôs creepy under any other situation
wasn‚Äôt even doing that either, so that‚Äôs when you know, that person is a bad.
it was also followed by the man staring at me as he kept driving, with the creepiest smile ever. pro tip: don‚Äôt do that.
technically everyone has breasts
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey they're making an open action/adventure one piece game
why did nobody tell me about this
fucking weebs
nope
boots
gonna be taking english 11 of course, physics of course, us history of course, psychology, criminology, and calculus ii
pretty sure that was confirmed quite  whilel ago
boots
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
also why would nintendo announce a direct for the 10th 3 days before it anyway
isnt there always a big january blowout though
you tried
what will we do with a drunken sailor
most problems are
that's cool
i'm sure i would do the same thing
yeah at some point i think i didnt really care
id assume the friction of moving makes that far more likely
but there's better air flow
aint no quicksand in my 10 square foot apartment but theres quicksand everywhere out there
just like that
i mean if you just walk through sand like that you probably had it coming
and i forget to ding the little bell thing
speaking of which let's check to see how long the very first channel i ever watched has been inactive
agh my calc ii prof hasnt gotten back to me so now im slightly terrified he wont before the class begins lmao
and i trust retro to do something
ok then
wake up you hoe
cynthia would like a word with you
i don't recall hearing about the characters representing new franchises
i'm just excited for joker's gameplay trailer
that was a fantastic last game
for the record it's "tertiary"
weird right?
maybe i should enter it into a virtual machine or something and find out
you and i speak the same language
i haven't gotten anything really bad since about 2010 either. somehow around then i got an infection that caused my computer's printer spooler to stop working. that was fun. and a pain in the neck because in 2010 i had to actually print out stuff.
python
any preferences as to how?
hmm you might not object to that
you can practically hear the whitespace
it just sounds like a gutteral hissing
as much as i want to give you attention rainy, it's my lunch break
rude
wait a minute
oh god who ungaged rainy
i literally just play to get diamond than quit
caged
probably something with sheep
i'm at like 10, i want 6 more
sleeping makes me anxious, fuck my life
finger had a minor stroke
never claimed to not be normal
outer osmosis derived dinosaurs
something something work suck
i solve the issue of sleeping making me anxious by being too tired to be anxious about it
yes you do
good thing i'm always tired
you know but to ask, darling
you left it up to me and what i decided wasn't good enough
oh wait, i might actually have a reason to be sad
wow, not giving attention to me, so rude
my heart feels at home
we should abolish snow
also, i only have one style of fashion and it usually involves a hoodie of some sort
10-20
and mag 2020, the year someone finally teaches eyan how to dress himself
although that feels like fricken forever ago now
save me some cake
it‚Äôs like how 2010 sounds really recent
dammit eyan, i fucking told you to save me some
the second i consume a single carb, all my abs will disappear
girls don't eat cake
this is discord, shitbrains
it really isn't
maybe i should go back to bed
i mean, i believe it
i mean, so does getting slapped in the face
i just remembered how i used to wear hoodies in the middle of summer
i mean i'm not aiming high for life, namely because i want to get a red seal for an electrition

evidently
yo same
stop being so popular
i am insulted
well, i'm doing my best, lol
which do you prefer
hmmmmm
maybe
and with pleasure
alright, yeah, i'm in
you wanna play now or later, how you feelin
i don't need your negativity and discrimination eyan
jeez
also, are you guys playing overwatch without me?  cause that's rude
yeah that
soo much
also what we playing
<:gwoiczenthink:390299938250293250>
games stuck on a black screen
stuck on "entering game"
look i just said remove it
budgeting 101 with panada
thanks
they need food <:gwaobapepecry:395628671911854081>
that would be good
does anyone have any recommendations of what kind of parts i should buy for my pc in the spring time?
i'm giving my share to the people
are you trying to _reduce_ your job security good sir
and i think there better than a 1060
that was fast
thank you autocorrect
sylas
what's his face
wait
i mean why don't you say you're bi and get over with it
rainy goes gay like 5 times a week, i'm not too worried about it
i generally only play one or two types of games, i only like a few genres of anime, i do the same things over and over
same
jesus christ you fucking morons
we know what you said.
clearly
nobody here was claiming that you said there was something wrong with vanilla
or at least i was
elaborating on their definition of being boring
also do most people side with the empire? reddit is like 90% stormcloak lmao
most people side with the imperials though
i wonder if those are the same people who turned on nick in fallout 4
3/10 aela never wears that many clothes
or is that mjoll
urf time
it's overwatch time
time to go home
because rainy likes being complicated
but respectable
definitely.
because usually theres also programming in there
men love boobs and skyrim
there are no good boobs in skyrim
place your bets for how long it'll take before we optimize and talk about boobs _in_ skyrim
someone doesnt appreciate c u l t u r e
the longer answer is that fake boobs are attached to fake women and these fake women are often idealized to what we like, making them innately more appealing than real boobs
that too
controversial opinion: i also do not understand the appeal of boobs that are big enough to generate significant gravitational fields of their own
also 99% of fake boobs dont work at all like real boobs. the defying of gravity is mesmerizing
i prefer concave chests myself
what, contemplations of anatomical geometry?
what's the point of boobs you don't share
no. i was just drawing lol
butt wasn't an option
can‚Äôt you like both?
lol what do you prefer panda
i want pizza
oh eyan
butt
i was gonna say all boobs, but rainy's answer works too
this is all a figment of your imagination
eyan you probably have one of those anime mousepads with the wrist braces on the bottom dont you
i actually don't dragonite
<:rooderp:531156967943569410>
except then i'd have to obtain one somewhere
if you're sitting at a proper angle, they pervent carpal tunnel
i spend literally all my spare time at my computer and ive never done anything like that to my wrists
fixed it
excuse me what the fuck
salud
i see there‚Äôs a party in vc or something
izi pizi
doubtful
still eatin tho
easy
define "doesn't look like it's from the ancient era"
sounds about right, dragonite
eyan tell them you're from the cia
crap im supposed to be cleaning my room brb
is this like lwiay but for papa ryan?
thats the problem haha
oh its a time limit, but i talk fast and its annoying
papers are so easy, bless
i cant write like anything
imma forget 90% of this speech
if i dont rush my words, it may be a solid 4 min speech.
i got an 85 in it
lucky
math. no. bad.
people seem suprised by 500+ a lot
all the good things hurt you
dont worry
arkada draw something else
i could, but i don't want to leave my other friends
<:oddonepog:509217203271499786>
back in brawl.
get me pizza
wonder how much work it would be to make my own
you rang
later nerds, i need to focus
eyan
it just works
my presence is a privilege
to panda
eyan didnt want you here anyways
you guys still in vc
the sequels
the protagonist of star wars
rain, rain, go away, come again another day
hmmm
rainy, come back
and i don't look as hot as sneaky yet, but i can dress up and look better than that
and my current xcom character honestly looks exactly like me
perv
i would so go back to gay for her
but i'm gay
coward
that's why i pick at their food
but i let them order
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
noctis is adorable
that's hermamora
hmmmmmm
oh i remembered why we aren't dating
i'm just so anti-investment banking
virgo that's it
look bella it's nothing to be ashamed of
the little mass-produced ones with memes on them and stuff
amirite
bella you didnt tell me you had a twin
better late than never i guess
there are things i should probably do but i dont feel like doing them
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
but they ain't cause you're investment banking is boring and you are a coward
be lazy, it's fun
rainy dont be rude to the one who can have you decapitated
this makes me want to look up zodiac stuff instead of writing notes for my speech.
go to bed you dumb fuck
which will probably happen
going to get food and probably sleep at a reasonable hour, eyan you should let rainy keep her head
alright
i'll have you know my grandmother was killed by an astrology doubter
oh man
ever
as in two days of me with my hair up working on essays all day at home, testing all day at school and forgetting to shower for once
game about the gays
it's a supernatural thriller
dumbass
i know c
what was it?
and hey, you love it
oh i'm not happy
lime what?
this is from work
an it reference
i make that specific reference all the fucking time
of course i want attention
this is what i'm getting in a couple years
i'm gonna drink another can of monster and then stream momodora
wow you fucking would
i'm not enough for you????
fine, i'll leave then
how dare you leave
now for the point of the night where i get existentially lonely and wonder why i told everyone to go to bed
oh good
ughh
yeah, i do
okay
one step
did someone say... panda onesie?...
so really i'm just staring at my screen thinking about all the things i don't wanna think about
oops
good one
that's why i got 6 hours of sleep
thunderdome ü§£
so tired...  v_v
what is sarcasm?
debatable
if i left at this point i worry you'd scarcely be able to maintain healthy autonomy
i‚Äôve just been playing red dead all morning
i gotta work a short shift this afternoon
same
i plan to be superior than all of my fellow humans
i'm gonna start streaming just so i can have this as my follow alert
free game
one of my actual faves
hmm tfw i can't get audio unless i use my capture card ~_~
spiderman grapple and parkour mechanics, it's good
wow rude
but i just did a flawless up turnip up throw up smash combo
ironically enough, the one time i do a thief playthrough, i really haven't used much stealth archery
cause i usually do beserker: alteration, two handed, light armor
i've done a fair number of nord playthroughs so usually two-handed, either light or heavy armor, block and then depending on the playthrough, ice magic, speech, enchanting, or maybe tossing in some one handed and block
<:treason:396483914803445761>
i never claimed it to be honorable, lol
just so i can dress a cat
the dun
9:27 am] king of zeal: i am a dumbass and rainy is too good for me.
i don't believe you
uhhuuuuuh
to be fair, dunkey is toxic, lol
irl stream? <:oddonepog:509217203271499786>
install linux and then blame it
smash me
i'm proud of you dear
i'm not interested in losing
nice
that i can do
are you talking to the robot again?
alright, going home
only if you rub me off instead
see ya'll in a few
yeah
you said a story
you thought his story was great?
oh boy, it's thursday, time for my weekly meal
dat's cool shade, i shall let you return to your work then
i been busy working on a twitch/ discord emotes commission atm
also, rainy, it's not a weekly meal if you've already had a meal
but fried food makes me feel sick thinking about it
ewww
i like tofu eggrolls
y'all entertain me, it's like a four mile walk
the only things that that's really happened with are potter and skyrim (not even pok√©mon, despite how much of that i played in high school)
those are few and far in between
but as long as it's an elder scrolls game i'll probably forgive it
hey panda can you post that kanna emote again
which one
but they are all valid
thanos laptop
bunny girl senpai is my choice for anime of the year
it had me actually smiling.
you have such wonderful and unreadable tiny squares
you're not a full thot
but newvada
foiled my plans
play the song
no u
well since you asked, i'm currently on my weekend after a seven day work week
no wait
gottem
why do i only hurt the people i love
in my opinion bunny girl wasn't that great
it's fine to have a bad opinion
wait are you trying to send me to gulag for wrongthink?
i mean don't get me wrong i like anime. just not funny girl senpai
bunny
have you considered being nice?
by that do you mean you will be nice to master and master alone, or do you mean you will be nice to master and literally not do anything else?
only the last seven years?
then we'd just have wyoming and not wyoming

can confirm; i fall asleep best around 4 pm
which is why despite being a clinical insomniac, i still get in bed and get up at the same time daily
i'm actually a pretty productive member of society all things considered
just be like me
ignore dragonite he fuels bad habits
emptiness is the only truth of life
if you think that's fueling bad habits you would not like to see my dms
precisely
whoa whoa, where's my invite?
that's not bragging that's doing a good job getting your life on track
i don't know
trying things you haven't before is a good start.
(‚óï Œµ ‚óï)
like not crash constan - oh wait it does that too
it doesnt support animated png though which sucks
i just have a copy of photoshop from 2007 that i keep reusing the install code for over and over
kind of what linus does in ltt
work
but with less words
wait are link previews off? i'm tilted
i mean  i have made some shit in premier like that edit i made that i sent to the meme chat
and i like typing words
i quite liked pinnacle, but that was before i knew what true editing power was like
movie maker was pretty nice
but it got the job done for really basic editing
or at least i assume it was in like 2001
no but really when i was 14 and had no idea how people cut video together and opened up movie maker for the first time, it was literally magical
same squid
so back then, movie maker quality was good enough to attract an audience
i honestly think i'm just gonna shoot to do my weekly series idea and any let's playing i do will be a side project for fun
cause like i've said, i've spent this past week trying to look out for you and you say i'm being rude
you call me a dumbass
cause newsflash dumbass, be it one way or another, i like you, i don't call people i don't like dumbass
i call them asshats or fucktards
~~i just don‚Äôt like most people~~
i like how we're suddenly having an academic conversation about the distinction between dumb and stupid and eyan
and also it's honestly way more cutthroat at the bottom of the ladder (and the middle, and the top) and way less "hey let's have fun" now
oh, i know it's your style, thus why i didn't take it as a downright insult, lol
it's just not particularly my style to call somebody i find endearing a "dumbass" lol
it's not a conversation, it's me explaining to the dumbass
it just doesn't really work well on me
please, i have no luck
i can do playful banter to an extent, but if i'm not in the mood for it or not particularly prepared for it, i can read it the wrong way
but i can respect that, so just know, that i'll never mean it spitefully, only endearingly, and i'll cut back on usage in which it could be construed negatively
i hope all of your depression is smited away
how are you today?
which is the perfect message for the new guy to see upon joing the server
oh good
ahh yes
if one's not in the mood, we just cool it and support instead
i would probably just let them know in a normal way that i didnt like that joke
feels weird when you use that abbreviation
~~cause i'm real good at sucking dick~~
eyan i really want to make some smart remarks about that but i'll leave it alone for now
my personal issue with that
but let me post something in blackomen
it's a potion of ultimate healing
it's this
i shall delete the bots as my first decree
i only need it for a minute
are you a hot single in eyan's area?
i'm sure i could make myself hot
i count anything within one states distance "my area" with the exception of upstate new york
should i delete and repost it?
previews on
the almighty thanos whale... has arrived
the almighty thanos whale has arrived!!!!!
can i take her place
but you know me
eyan very much rigidly defined everyone's perms on blackomen
and then playing limbo
why did riot recommend me viktor
jesus
in more ways than one
pretty sure i'm the only one from new jersey
i refuse to be upstaged by ninja bartender
no but i've taught him all the memes so he could probably convince people that he is
hd supply can burn in hell
holy crap, the bot gave a very real response, lol
five what
that's about the best way to put it.
where i live, we say yinz
uh, not really
where are you from by the by
here
off to a real life ceilidh in a few minutes with an american friend
yinz is a term hailing from yinzer land, aka pittsburgh, lol
also from pennsylvania as it happens
although she still claims to have won the superbowl
why do people not like philly again
pretty tame if you ask me
you weren't alive in 1994
well
we live in a society
1990s: "we dont have enough features, add more"
2010s: "we have too may features, get rid of something"
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
i've cooked for many picky friends and partners
what kind of food do you like?
alright, but you have to feed me as well
or at least it is for me now
but that's the fun <:gwaobapepecry:395628671911854081>
it's no secret i'm picky
and i'm a good cook
i had a friend who wouldn't eat anything with any form of tomato in it at all, and italian is my specialty
also a baker
also pasta is literally the only thing i make and half the time it still comes out overcooked so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
lmao
actually that's not true once i made this thing with chicken that came out okay. what was it called? i have no idea. how did i make it? i have no idea.
because if you don't bake your pasta you can go to hell
historically people have needed far few reasons to do things than they have to not do things
a squid walks into a bar.
i think i just burned myself
so the correct wording would be "a squid _squelches_ into a bar"
i can imagine
thanks
i don't know what i want to do right now
isn't that what you want me to do?
i never said i objected
i questioned the real motive behind your statement
uhhhhhhhh
and i find your vocabulary and sentence structure equally as charming
right now, doing you is probably what would make me most happy right now, lol
well i find your frequently retroactive tact entirely amusing and charming
<:gwoicfidgetthinker:390299944910848000>
good to know
just realized baro is probably in town
also furret are just under two meters long
sounds hot
that's what a koffing is for
i just want a roserade so my home would always smell fantastic and i could poison my enemies
10/10 tricky tanky ice type
ice body restore health in rain
restore health in hail rather
of course, as a trainer, steel types are obviously my favorite
dunno
it's starts to get muddled after what i listed off
primarina's nice but rowlett can move its face independantly of its head
<:keepo:327304799919800321>
more jpeg as ordered
he said jpg not jpeg
god damnit
i got distracted
i like mismagius more than honchcrow
honchkrow, sorry
purple things
i can actually get either a mismagius or roserade, which should i get first?
it's probably an odd fetish of mine, but damn do wedding dresses get me going
and then i shall be in pittsburgh in 27 hours and we will be watching rwby
and i guage everyone's romantic compatibility based on who in the show they are like.
i just know that i'd supposedly love the scythe girl
qrow is better
wow and two weeks again
spooky
i want one
one sec
does amazing rwby art
also
i also like this one
i was lied to
im sure if you ask rainy for another she'll give it to you
is it safe?
gladly
just embrace it
i am truly inspired by your words nutter
rainy no one ever said that
oh, i have a good folder system, don't worry
if we're posting art
well, iris heart did
respectable
not plutia
understandable
i agree.
post it anyways
that ori pic is awesome
look
rainy why do you do this to me
i heard something about birdbox(?)
black mirror bandersnatch was pretty cool
havent seen it tho
last village is already gone
sad that this is how it had to happen
my art folder was out of sfw stuff anyways
also, i didn't know i could get more attractive either
ironically the smash censorship was a blessing for less than sfw images of mythra
there are other security measures
but that‚Äôs effort
fukc
zeke x morag melts my cold heart
realmaster, i am hurt that you think that way of me
that's actually pretty cool
pay up
i liked peach back in brawl, she was probably like, maybe my 4-5 that i'd occasionally play when i was bored of my mains
god dammit
daisy is my current smash main
smug dead inside zelda is me
now i get to say bowser is hot without getting weird looks in public
can't hear you
iirc
okay, but in game if mario doesn't touch a flag or axe every 500 seconds he dies
or are you talking about smash?
yeah, more or less
please if i'm stupid then that would make everyone else
but people can "progress" like, 3 bosses worth of gameplay in an hour or two if they move quickly so if you decide to build a nice home, suddenly, you're playing catch up or just being gifted gear upgrades
i don't even know what you are trying to say
what im trying to say is theyre not the most rational of people
i kind of need her alive
i could probably still beat it though
we never said that he was rational with this
what is my corpse supposed to turn into a furret?
but somebody changed their name, lol
i'll stream after i eat which is right now, bbl
but that's just me
i'm gonna say it's short for babylon
if i'm to be a furret i better learn surf and headbutt
that's rude panda
i'll just turn you into my hm slave with cut only.
like he's annoying me too, hence i proposed murdering him
well i never claimed to not be
oh it's not you
maybe 12?
i just need to choke something
well still, either way agitation falls under that category
out of curiosity
that's up to you though
i should probably join stream but i'm listening to someone play jurassic park music on the french horn
but french horns
why is my life so complicated
a healthy dose of steel alloy a day keeps the doctor away
i just like this artist's style a lot
wait why isnt eyan streaming?
i looked up the simpsons rating
told you to stream
you're lucky you pay me a lot of money
before streaming
odd technique but ok
i would've been banned along time ago
if you don't the universe will explode
eyan
he never finishes
delet
lmfao
nice
candy cease
stop
delet you
do i get to say a catchy one liner before the delet
wait
mr stark
honestly getting kicked in the vagina is pretty painful <:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
or every fourth person in all four
this is a very complicated family tree
yeah
so you can call me daddy?
nice
scarlet witch
how did i do that
cause she's a bad bitch
and she dies
wait
did anyone get spanked by thanos?
i could join stream or i could go to sleep early again
i am happy af
!skram
if  you could follow my twitch that would be greatly appreciated üòÑ
just go to the arctic circle
we got like an eighth of an inch last night i hate it
is that like a handicap for "playing without normal metabolic process" or something
sounds like a terrible design decision
keep speaking like  tierzoo and im gonna flick your nose
pretty sure living on your own is adopting yourself
actually just gonna start smacking your nose with a newspaper like a dog
alright back to streaming
but fuck i'm cute when i put effort into how i look
my fucking roommate doesn't understand that his loud fucking movie that hes watching can be heard
people keep telling me i should play ff14
but that's limited in some ways
like you're not allowed to join a free company, add friends, do pvp or pass level 35
food for thought
tho buying the expansions after getting the base game doesn't extend that time
i should definitely give the trial version a go though, my mmo experience is limited to like a half hour of eso and most of that was me going "wow there are a lot of buttons i can press"
well ffxiv starts off with few buttons
sigh
more storage devices
i was told
gonna stream sc2 so people can laugh at how badly i suck
boop
and that's on top of all the backlog i had from last week, lol
well then.
this still feels weird
you're not wrong, i generally learned better off on my own, problem was, i'd just cream, lol
luckily my school was all right with that but i wasn't gonna worry about it either way
its okay theres more quality content to watch
wanna bet rainy?
listen mate thighs are god's gift to us and no one can convince me otherwise
i saw it earlier; it‚Äôs pretty good
why am i seeing ads for bras
~~do you have interest in cross dressing?~~
screw you too google
(‚ïØ¬∞–¥¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ /(.‚ñ° . \\)
be like general grievous
follow his example.
or it just looks cool
going to take a wild guess that this is a "no"
that‚Äôs what happens when eyan needs energy
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
sup bitches, your queen graces you with her presence
~~they are if you know they have a dick and you want them because of that~~
i would gladly take a subreddit full of cat gifs right now
humor him
skarm you're only three years old
go for it.  üòõ
im not really in a bad mood it twas just a goof
hopefully it'll be smoother sailing from there.
who needs deleting?
ah yea, i think you'll be just fine though man youre friggin draco
sounds good
mine are 8 weeks instead of 15 for examples.
look at you nerd and your...job. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i‚Äôm getting ready to do nothing and relax until i gotta go work a closing shift
~~it‚Äôs not nice when i have to work~~
true that
probably, draco
hmm.
what's a paladin
thinkingface
weeb
calm down war
why not
you have my word
heat up the blade first i wanna be branded
well now you're just being picky
way to stay optimistic
it's always been my dream to be killed by candy
candy do you own terraria?
fight fight fight
10 paces
gotta negotiate a place then too
and much as i want to die, i live to please
relatable
terraria
preach
verbal agreements are binding if either party starts to act on it
or enough
i puke it up shortly after
why tf
meat is great
so yeah
hmmm
rainy you home?
no rainy
nobody is fucking hillary
but what do i make
pasta
burg
depends on what would be on the burger but likely burger
now 9k, you may ask me, did i just spend the last of my plat on being pink?
if you don't kill/die looking good, what's the point.
i miss her
also hai draco and xeon
this lesson doesnt look that long and it looks super interesting
if my view of the course is correct i'll be nearly 2 - 3 chapters ahead
is there like a clean version or something that seems like it would be a common kind of survey to make
finally got around to deciding who i'm gonna put effort into in smash ultimate
they have most of high rock in it and it's pretty likely that that's where es6 is taking place
shulk and marth are always gonna be my boys
i've been having a lot of fun with lucas
and i've been on a metroid kick lately and ridley's actually good
i just like palutena
can't really say for 4, because i didn't get the dlc for that one
i just enjoy the kit
pk flash/freeze - freeze looks cooler
pk fire - knockback on lucas, wall of fire on ness. personally prefer the knockback
pk thunder - lucas's goes through people
also, full disclosure, i picked palutena because i like thighs
or in other words
plz dm it to me, thank you
top 10 photos taken seconds before disaster
uh ok
youd think someone named angery boio would have a higher wrath rating
does it ever strike you how odd the naming of final fantasy x-2 is
nope
final fantasy 100
i can confirm this
sounds good
super mario land 2 comes after super mario bros 3
also
oh u rite
this sounds complicated
when shulk says theyre eating people
bloodthirster also has +3 to both attack and damage rolls
god fucking bless
+9 to hit +11 to damage is still really good
what the hell are these queue times
4 times per turn
somecallmejohnny finally noticed me
speedrunning marathon for charity
i redid it, this is me
thanks
case in point.
then you aren't really better at smash
so, rainy's evil, and she doesn't have laziness holding us back
but gluttony counters pride, and sloth counters avarice, and those two sins are me summed up, so i've no time for the others
pretty accurate
the latter
and maybe
and go through their upload histories
night my dude, gl hf don't die
no u
everyone deserves a good night
kugal
thats right i said it
y'all ever just stay up till 1 30 am and imagine yourself in a fantasy setting
yea you'd want that huh
i wish you would talk here more because i like having you around
shoe's on the other foot now huh?
i've found this discourse immensely nice if we're gonna go there
will do
i should also head to bed
looks cool
interesting lol
i keep thinking about my weekly series idea, i really want to do it, lol
~~kingofskarmory.~~
pretty much
work isn't really supposed to be fun, lol
yeah but- dammit
lmaooo
would somebody who is flawless choose to be with a lesser being who isn't flawless?
pity
also good morning darling, and the rest of you lot
i won't be dying for the next several thousand years, so i would prefer to spend less of it feeling lonely.
i always feel like i scare people off when i'm here
my current setup is an scourge aasimar  fighter (gunslinger) level 6 and i'm planning on taking some levels in wizard for some illusion and defensive spells
bring a laptop with you for low work days or when it's snowing
ive been needing to record something since right after christmas, and it would probably take all of like five minutes, and ive kept putting it off, and suddenly my self-imposed due date is mid-afternoon on saturday and i still havent done anything
have you tried mountains?
out of curiosity pm
also, we're not understaffed, we just value actually working at work, sort of
glad someone else gets it
and why do you even _own_ that many pencils
he is still sitting there
sure
wait a minute i can just slap him in the face and be satisfied with that
relevant
10 paces, not ten steps
yup, gen 5 is best
okay, but look her up on the internet
i mean, don't get me wrong, she, is hot
but the generation as a whole
nvm, you're good then
cats are the solution
cats
ok i have a better solution
they should have made cynthia playable in dppt then gen 4 would have been objectively the best
it was an honest question
guns? are you playing the mtg version?
yeah so we just got up and left
currently replaying the original version of bowser's inside story
eyan dont _all_ of your exes have cats
my kitty, ryu
3 if you count the stray that collette looked after for a while, but it wasn't her cat by any means
yup üòÅ
also, very true drago ^^
i was told we have a criminal here, come out with your hands up <:gwowokannagun:358278230341320706>
i literally have a curtain of the things cascading down from a hook on my closet door
good point
katia, max
jesus that place is bot infested
i apparently have wisdom teeth. i also learned what wisdom teeth are today
wisdom teeth are great
theyre totally pointless and take you out for like eight whole days when they have to dig them out
imoutos are sisters, dragonite.
im so sensitive to pain from my meds id probably fucking explode if i got any kind of surgery even a minor one
im not gonna bother getting it removed
ouch, literally
yeah pimaster
everything is ouch and the getting rid of the ouch makes other things ouch harder
same
i need serious professional help.
neither have i
i cant type ok
in regards to why my lust is low, its because i only really use sex for jokes
or threaten it with invasion
it doesn't _currently_ have oil you mean
master is the last one i would have expected to delete that
stream just ended lul
i cant read
this guy looks so troll
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
if you're more north though, yeah, you're probably fucked, lol
this is what having no life really looks like
ok so
and absolutely nothing would change
riki as a *character* is fine.
but he has absolutely zero plot relevance
bouncing off reyn's head was pretty plot relevant
and i‚Äôm okay with that
wait.
i just realized.
mushroom universe is part of the bionis universe confirmed
all the stuff in bionis interior makes a lot more sense now
he'd totally do this
my networking teacher talked about bitwise and today and im pretty sure i was the only other one in the room who wasnt totally lost
bitwise is great
it looks like we‚Äôre going to be getting quite a bit of snow and ice tomorrow
i'll just stick him on the pi, create an infi ite loop and chuck it out the door
yeah there is suppost to be about a subway sandwich of snow
theyll be falling from the sky, why go somewhere and pay money for one?
lol, literally just saw that tweet
i wouldn't mind a subway brand snowblower
it was never my intent to deceive
also i am now feeling ·µÄ ∞·µâ ·µá·∂¶·µç À¢·µÉ·µà
i could be wrong howvwr
brb grabbing a drink to honor a fallen brother
or is it the polyhedronal demi solid kind?
simple, sleep, and then do schoolwork
that's what i did
boing boing, everyone have a pancake
did someone up and vanish off the planet?
a new xbox one controller because the a button keeps sticking, headphones because mine aren‚Äôt working that well anymore, and a microphone for videos
gen 5 is still good to me
pre gen 5 over here
eyan you should pushthe upload date ahead by three days so when you do post nobody will know if theyre being trolled or not
i honestly think turning pokemon into 3d models ruined the series for me
do it
do it
i wanted to do a trailer for the channel anyways, so that's such a brilliant idea
but it'll have me
inb4 eyan dying in space
scishow did a fun video on wonderfully explosive compounds a while ago
skarm has returned.
aka my childhood.
it doesnt????
im kidding, don't over exert
did someone say xenoblae
originally i wanted to do it weekly, and if i went with that plan, i might have had a literal date planned for something like that, but i scrapped that because i'd be overdoing it.  i'm trying to have realistic expectations and goals right now
nein
alrighty
squid shut up
no i don't like that
i was thinking more xenoblade 2
~~‚Äùthis sucks because blah blah not pok√©mon blah blah‚Äù~~
i'm still kinda planning something along those lines, but i just don't think weekly is a realistic time frame, plus, i want to test the waters and see the reception of the series.
but i don't want to do it, this assignment is dumb
ok im gonna go get help
i actually don't have a preference though
it didnt have to be nasa i just did that because it sounded the least awful
i shall put you on fill duty dragonite
hi majestic ^w^
wow, me too skarm. <:oddonepog:542511305349922836>
i caught dialga on the first pokeball
congrats
the spreadsheet is like where most of my sadness is
times i wish i had hypnosis
damn
that thing  cloud autosaves work every half second and is really easy to access from any device
like this morning i woke up just in the worst mood not int he mood to do jack shit, as soon as i see feedback from the prof on my assignment my mood was instantly changed and i felt on top of the world until i heard about my fucked files
destruction of sadness does feel like there is some symbolism to it though
fun fact: i have a pretty distinct dent in my skull already
lmao
wrote 438 words in the past hour for my personal notes, i should probably be focusing on the english homework and not said notes
i shoulda specified
here it is
"no work was done because fucking frank used a defective bucket and ended up just making a mess when he was supposed to fill up the watering system. fuck you frank, you're fired" -management
my pdf was 6 pages long lmao
can i just cancel speech class for the rest of time?
your calculus course sounds a lot more fun
here during the last portion of the test the teacher just stopped caring and had the instructions "set up but do not integrate"
oh crap
it's kind of a heartwarming comic
damn
#relatable
if i had to do it you have to do it
so, i‚Äôm pretty much going to avoid the internet for a bit in a few minutes
alright mario maker now
they fucking made a tetris battle royale
taura and kamiya working together on a cyberpunk 3rd person spectacle game?
that was honestly a pretty disappointing game to end on
in the eye of the hurricane there is quiet
listen
i may have got nothing i thought i wanted from this direct, but i got everything i never knew i wanted
all is normal in the world
classic
i expected mother 3 finally
and whoever else
master if i wanted that answer id have posted this on reddit
what did you do
thats just when you substitute warframe for sleep
youre always sleep deprived
hey man
what?
sure why not
of course you do
why do i still want it?
i need it
which i find hilarious
i am uncomfortable
how'd you find our little corner of the internet?
oh, sounds neat! thank you!
if i told you id have to kill you
yes and i needed them last tuesday
<:doit:334014889137930240>
now it's just dumb.
can this meme die already
it's not even funny dumb
the only characters i can play are shulk and marth and marth, but without tippers
wait a minute randall munroe is writing a new book but it's not coming out until september
i knew it
its pretty sad
i know
i think it's like the things from war of the worlds but im not sure
are you sure about that, 9k?
finally got my channel going after 2 months in the making
pancakes indeed, good friend
of course it was
from his point of view of course
i've been putting you with you people for two years
boarding is in 10 mins, why is it legal to have flights this early?
you seem knowledgeable in the ways of food

rc want to put in my ram sticks for me
very
there's uh
does anybody know why ram looks like a shaving razor
one stick in and nothing has exploded yet
lets see if it doesnt catch fire when i turn it on
im prety sure the first one is okay thought because windows responded when i took the second one out
that you have to wonder how and why it got approved
i don't see how 1999 was wrong
does everyone have the same block fall speed though or can the advanced players rush ahead with quick downs? does everyone get the same exact block series or is it various for everyone?
now youre thinking like a game designer
which are really the same thing
meh fuck it it's probably good i mean, i dont know how else i can answer it
read that as universal constants of meth
they really should have picked a better location
good job
this leads into

i did it \o/
maybe squid needs sleep
i don't know, maybe a phrase that starts with v and ends with y
says you
transhumanism
the future
i am a cyberpunk nerd, this is my shit
it's a debate of nomenclature more than proper philosophy
idk people already push the limits of species as it is
i mean
imagine if we called all electronic devices "doodads" and didnt differentiate between tvs, computers, phones, web servers, etc
though more of a cover
hmm the school computers let me install stuff to the program files directory
master why cant you go play fun games
but all other instances you can get to by the time you own rhino
i don't own rhino cause i don't care to own rhino
and holy shit is that iron skin addicting
you press 2 to become immune to damage, you press 3 to double your damage, 4 to knock up enemies, and then you just weapon them to death like the jengo fett that you are
what numbers be they?
3 and 4 are unnecessary
the day patreon starts taking a 30% cut of creators income is the day the internet will break
anyways, good night. annd pancakes
yeah.
even if youtube gets a competitor, i doubt it would amount to much because of how much of a juggernaut youtube is
what if we made a platform for sharing videos
i do think he would be able to start it all on his own
look at how many people he got to fight the battle against t series
can confirm
wait no
im pretty sure candyman and rainy have money trees
i'm pretty sure its like 10m
who would do marketing though
oh wait
tmw your robot has a more robust love life than you
just the romantic story i needed
maybe so
kugal i'm outsourcing my eyeglasses appoinment to you so i can play xenoblade for three more hours
no more
say no more
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
are you certain though
just rest after surgery was much more preferred
considering i feel pain
what happened?
and im out of oxy so im not tired all the time now
what about your before-work nap and your during-work nap
my two hour lunch is a two hour nap
boing
yeah but how much of it was you
i was just thinking about how my computer hasnt frozen since i replaced the ram
unthaw it then
was it an *explosion* of flavor? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
hey don't sentence squid to death for a pun
i have the wii shop song stuck in my head help
life mission freaking accomplished
there is no salvation
specifically the version with awkwardly long pauses
ok so
kana peak
prudent
huzzaaahhh
yeah, that happens. thankfully no surprise uniques in 1
the concept was discovered during the industrial revolution as part of the effort to make motors more efficient
entropy applies
say that to their face
hey michael, vsauce here
vsauce
it's like 0.01% of adobe flash but on the 3ds
~~no, the other kugal~~
it‚Äôs pretty windy here; windy enough for the power to flicker off twice
so about the aesthetics then
if youre lazy like me a good way to get the permalink is to hit previous and next and youll be back where you started but not on the front page
oh yeah
thats a horrible way to format
thinking
it needs more jpeg master
im in a little bit of a pickle here
theres a lot of ways by which skarm can be made to summon me
1 is a bard the other is a rogue and the other is a warlock
i already volenteered to be dungeon master not realizing tha about 8 people come in a span of around 10 minutes
i was wondering when you were going to show ip
your handwriting is even worse than mine
this is unacceptable
custom made minis for my dnd party
no u
is that your excuse now
encryption suggests that youre able to reverse the process and not destroy the data though
lies
a unique key is generated for every message
agh, i don#'t have space in my current group
if i had more time
dont make me count
don't change the subject mister
cadance she's probably avian and robotic
when shulk says im really feeling ti
she is tired of the memes like the rest of us
that's funny whenever shulk says "i'm really feelign it" i says "well at least that makes one of us"
first off.\
then there's also this somehow connected
next up,
he gets a 2.5x multiplier for his english voice also
guys i have a dumb question
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
now it's basically bypassed my backlog entirely
wait this one's better
where are you finding these
with a little luck somebody's going to realize that is a sauce pot on my head before i graduate
starters for the new pokemon generation üëÄ
i have that same guide back home in india lol
oh good, i'm not the only one who thinks that
i actually was positive toward the 7th gen starters even though i tend to be highly critical of newer pokemon designs, but these are flat out trash imo
animaniacs
the grass one has "potential" but it's going to be a hard sell unless it has stunning evolutions.
yeah that's what i'm banking on at this point
i usually don't care for the fire starter, but it's the only one that has any appeal to me.
i only glanced at the video since i'm at work, but everything else looked really cool, so i'm semi-optimistic.  pokemon designs aren't everything i suppose
i dont think so somehow
fire one looks the least bad
actually the water ones pretty cute the more i see it
people are worrying it‚Äôs fire/fighting and if it turns out to be that it‚Äôll be sad. and a little funny
i want a fire/fairy bunny, a true gay icon
incineroar
scorbunny (soccer/football)
grookey (cricket)
sobble (water polo)
oh god, brexit jokes all over my timeline
shield hero would like to disagree with you
"alright, we saw what gen 8 has, so when do we get gen 9?" lol
funny that you mentioned ass the same moment my classmate did
clearly not
monkas
and he used to do youtube
well, we seem to always get at least one new eeveelution in a generation with an even number
gamefaqs says no
if you're counting megas, then they also made charizard part dragon after all =w=
no human being would reasonably interpret that as meaning the save button is disabled
can i like hex edit the game to enable saving because im not leaving my wii to idle until april
so according to the recording it was about an hour exactly and 5-10 minutes of skippable cutscene
`you know there's || spoiler text || now right?`
btw eyan is not my real name.
why exactly am i binging on dude perfect stereotypes and scott the woz videos, again?
what about a meat sword?
i thought fiora was the 7th party member, but it was actually chief dunga
dead font
but when zanza said "it's perfectly safe"
deinos sauros
and that kind of thing
ok so
just yes
next we have battle quotes!
i thought it was riki #2
squid you could be a meat shield
just so you folks know
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
welcome
you dont know pain until you have taken project-based calculus 2 in an engineering school
master did something probably
don't try being positive on me mister
i hear the classes that would have came after that are even worse though
who needs to know how to differentiate the curvature of a raindrop so badly that it's like 25% of their final grade seriously
this is the end of me
my bot is officially better at calculus than me
that's neat i guess
<:lul:528108303939665920>
i stopped caring about it after a little bit also
and sobble
im probably going to go with whoever has the coolest mascot, like usual
being fire fighting
platinum
fire/fighting
i think they could easily do this for the tutorial area with the galar region btw (i got the region name right?)
"do you need any help with pokemon training -your name-?" ~ the professor in front of a school
yes or no
it would be better than asking in the beginning of the game also while making your character
iirc in the town where falkner is in 2nd gen the teacher of the school asked if you needed help
i need help navigating the d pad and a button, if you don't mind
it would have been really handy if console manufacturers had been designing the input devices to mimic their intended function ever since the days of the nes, right?
the vines on the house looked blurry but
i bet you anything if something was changed with 8th gen people would be like
hey remember the puddle from the spiderman or whatever it was
also eyan might hate me for this but
i forgot about that
hey master remember when it was called big brother in code before i decided that might skeeve people out
i still think it might be
i dont really care honestly
going through jubilife city many times
not entirely though since you could only visit part of it the first time through
dragonite stays on this earth for two reasons: magfest and skyrim 2
jesus
it was a bit confusing in my recent replay of it
big sigh
i looked in so many cafes for the last one
i thought it was just battling
the pokeathelon was great
lucky bastards, having childhoods
my childhood was a childhood
you would have no life
should i send his code to you via transistor radio
but then there's nothing special about the "binary" descriptor
it's like the communications infrastructire they used during the cambrian explosion
eüÖ±ic
no the pringles are mine
and probably sword or shield or something
is an example of 1.a like "hey guys check out my work and support me on patreon!" followed by posting 10 different pieces?
i assumed that "you should share content once" meant like if you had like a picture of aqua and megumin from konosuba, you could only post each one of them once rather than just one or the other once
you can post the 10 pieces but dont ask for patreon support
lmao
though that might be a bit confusing because the rules specific 3 - 5 minutes long if its a video/audio
i guess make a 5 minute podcast
yea im gonna be in a hurry in a minute
it's like a research project
and i still have to do some research
and it's due wednesday
let me know if you need music
which do you think would best fit a research project video centered around genocide?
the correct answer is skyrim music
skyrim music is under middle ages
we should probably have 1 day be the unit we're working backward to seconds from
which solves some problems and makes some new ones
a nice base of 2
they already hated working with dates and times
how time flies
its probably worth mentioning to everyone who has me added on league that i changed my name to aloix
welcome
not do homework
hope you get well soon, majestic.
you aren‚Äôt
getting sword ofc
that'll give enough room for "we're stuck on a different planet" and nla day to get engraved into your skull
or do i not do more homework
congratulations, you have activated stage 2: superwinter
mechonisonis
let us play a game
and i hated it
unfinished battleonis
i don't even know what the fuck the water starter is supposed to be
dunban's level of coolness
that was it
no it's a baconator with a colossal squid in it
how about
it's not canon
the best ones are the ones where the last letter is already an "n" though
squid don't encourage rc.
dicksononis
ive only seen like four heart to hearts because im too lazy to look at the list of the ones that are available
intellectuals use dundun
if i didn't start doing it, then he would. so it was inevitable
problem solved
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
wait
at least the first and maybe the second was on wii u virtual console though
i'd like to get to golden sun at some point, it's just that i'll need those games to be rereleased, because i have the feeling those games are stupid rare now.
the guards on those light bridges are also not very good
i cant post the other two now though because they dont fit in the size limit and i dont feel like squeezing them
that respawn location is practically as bad majora's mask respawn points
i just want the number to be as high as possible
like... poke yes, but don't try to burst, and don't use your crowd control offensively unless you know that we can't get turned on
yeet
> physics
thoughts?
hmmm
im happy i don't have to write a math essay this year like i usually do
naisu
i've written four essays so far and have two left to finish by the end of this week.
ey yi yi draco
most important question
incorrect
the stress man lol
i threw up a little while typing that
that's great, nicely done
two weeks
i can imagine so
it feels like it should be special attack stat but it doesnt seem to work like that
x should be interesting in that case
first time i've had a teacher snap at me today for the first time in like 6 years
alright well im never saying a word in that class again
(‚óï Œµ ‚óï)
so i don't know where the gray area is
working on it!
ranger
grenadier
i thought i was already set up as a grenadier?
i'm gonna be sticking with grenadier
sharpshooter
i thought "grenadier" was a kind of candy until i saw it spelled
>provolone s tier
dragon eevee when
my work here is done
the hell is wrong with you
you know what i can accept that
oh ok understandable
good burgers
nice place
shame it closed down
bestestonis
i saw some really cool art of steel eevee yesterday but i can't find it.  v_v
at least turn it off first
dont lick your graphics card
ahhhhhhh, i want to be at home right now.  üò≠
oh, i've got it all, don't worry
riki the legendary heropononis
i wish ice types didn't suck across pokemon games as a whole
well, the xcom series will be a let's play
alright
digital forensics in criminal justice and fundamentals of networking.
do i need to cite the candy?
the hardest part is getting started so having a bit of a head start on a fresh start will maybe give me the slightest glimmer of hope of hitting it big again
and that's gonna be the next crash
it sounds selfish on paper, but if i'm not enjoying myself, nobody will enjoy what i make anyways
yeah
i'm actually pretty hyped
i really don't care much about too many new games which is nice
gen 6 was so forgettable, i don't remember disliking it, i just don't remember playing it, lol
hello so hyped
because 6 and 7 were no better than 5
nice
where does xenoblade 1/2 fit in all of this?
"theory" has basically no meaning outside of science anymore
and used bionis slash x
nice
i wouldnt even care if the internet wasn't the internet and people don't get that it's just fiction
i actually like tora the most out of the three main nopon in the series
i've never used vespiquen but i remember it getting solid praise back in the day
mostly because the other two fucking suck story wise
oh yeah that thing existed
xeno 2 box art
the last thing i'm still figuring out is a name for the "weekly series" idea, which has turned into an every other week series, lol
interaction
i know of nothing about xenoblade x
fortunately at that point in time gamestop hadnt entered freefall yet and you couldnt go more than about a half a block without tripping over one
i got one for 50 in 2015 and had to go to the fourth-nearest gamestop to find a copy
wait the sticker on my x copy says it was 20 before tax, i feel like it should have been like double that
tatsu is xenoblade x's token nopon
and then we went and saw inside out.
it was only relevant at launch
the title looks like it's just megadimension 7
i should play persona
you of all people never beat x?
i don't remember the details since, well, never beat x
legit
i have new pfpf
this joke feels like a repost
that's actually pretty compelling
they even incorporated the shield and sword into the anatomy
needsmorejpeg
that'd be a terrible surgeon
that's all you had to say
but my room was legit so cold
and it‚Äôs frickin hilarious
you all know nia‚Äôs welsh accent?
do you happen to you recall where you originally found it, eyan?
i really wish i did, but the only reason i was able to post that is i left a tab of it up, i couldn't find the original reddit post

it was fine
it was a well made eeveelution idea.
though he's been getting better and sending me more shorter/interesting vids
before i had like a 35% interest rate in his vids now thats up to like 70%
so i might get xeno 2 for my birthday
how could i have been blind to this
thats just the xc2 box art
weird
mario party battle royale
whoever places lowest that turn gets knocked out
which is why everyone rolls at once
tnat wlj
i feel like 40 would be the good number
the problem is the pickup-and-play-ability of the game
hence the success of tetris99
i don't get it
id say it has to do with how industrialization was the death knell for a lot of the natural world but i know the internet is 100% not sophisticated enough to come up with something like that
did you ever have two threads open on reddit and respond to the wrong one
it do be like that sometimes
master im giving my reddit account to you
that is oddly satisfying to know
is there a scientific term for the "brick wall"
13 is the minimum for it to give a consistent result
let's see how it does with non-roman proper nouns
it's one of the things that comes naturally to us programmers after a while
i know how to streamline my lol ranked sheet win rates
you think i know what half this shit is?
so, the input was this
a dozen exactly
well i am
upon furhter work, there is a google translate function inside of the sheet to automate the process
and by that i mean js takes forever to do that if i decide to
it's pretty great
nopon are made from rubber it seems.
how about i live in a universe where battle royales don't exist
then we wouldn‚Äôt have tetris battle royale
i need an excuse to ruin my life further
does that mean you stay up for two nights or you stay up twice in one night
ever
but dark isn't a quantifiable thing it's just the absence of light so it makes sense to say you have two lights but it doesnt make sense to say you have two darks
my teacher was talking about bitwise with one of the other groups in my class today
i have never been jealous in my life until today
bullshit
imagine a person who perpetually lives in magfest
hmmm
netflix has a page for it but it 404s
i fell asleep to that movie every night for like, the entire latter half of middle school
i mean none of the characters in silence of the lambs are livestock so
are they not?
and that is how i live my life
screw charm strange truth beauty
rise up
you're not very good at quarky humor
relevant
why counterfeit when you can just buy a threadripper, duplicate the shit out of that and sell it for half price?
explains the eye searing resolution
pretty sure vi just feels awful now
yeah those are some good changes
the big things to me are the w and r changes
and that r buff is huge
i knew that much
screw you too
they can tell someone's been binging certain videos, apparently
now you can procrastinate three times faster
how does it feel to have more screen real estate?
by the way now that im done with xenoblade im probably going to un-backlog nier automata next so prepare to hear me fanboying over it soon
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
i know the feeling
it is nice to not have to deal with swap space nonsense every time i open premiere
happens all the time
i bought the cheapest ram in their entire store do i _look_ like someone who has money
see? you figured it out!
why would you waste a three-word shout cooldown on a word wall
that's a cactus
i finally did it guys, i have bought chrono trigger ds
disrespecting the dragonborn tends to end badly
so good to kill lorithia
i think the word braggadocious is really underrated.
it‚Äôs a good word
hey virus
apparently, today is national napping day, according to twitter
that sounds like floating point
floating poi t
maybe that was floating poit also
lmao
i said the same thing basically
naisu
good idea
the volunteer thing i drove 50 minutes to get to may not be happening today
update: just running late. that works.
calaklaba
i‚Äôm sure you did fine
now that i have interacted with a girl, maybe my dad will get off my back about talking to gorls
at the beginning i had that panic moment where i couldn't remember my address lmao
haven't had that happen for address but i get where you're coming from
