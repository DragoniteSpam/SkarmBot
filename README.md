### This is the original version of SkarmBot. It is mainly still here for historical and / or comedic purposes; I would not recommend using any of the code you find in it.

# Additional Requirements:

A discord API token named token.txt placed in the parent of this directory

A Wolfram Alpha token named wolfram.txt placed in the parent of this directory

# SkarmBot

Instructions on how to run:

**Make sure node.js is installed and you have all tokens**

In Command Line:

```cmd
git pull https://github.com/DragoniteSpam/SkarmBot.git

cd skarmbot

node bot.js
```

For those happening across this in a search of the Internet, this bot is held together by duct tape and spaghetti and magically magically works. Use at your own risk.

I would not recommend "borrowing" our code because there are way better resources out there.

(the wolfram thing is kinda neat though)
