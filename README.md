# Additional Requirements:

# SkarmBot

Instructions on how to run:
node bot.js



For those happening across this in a search of the Internet, this bot is held together by duct tape and spaghetti and magically magically works. Use at your own risk.

I would not recommend "borrowing" my code because there are way better resources out there.

(the wolfram thing is kinda neat though)
