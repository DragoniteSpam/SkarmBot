# Additional Requirements:

A discord API token named token.txt placed in the parent of this directory
A Wolfram Alpha token named wolfram.txt placed in the parent of this directory

# SkarmBot

Instructions on how to run:

In Command Line:
git pull https://github.com/DragoniteSpam/SkarmBot.git
cd skarmbot
launcher.bat


For those happening across this in a search of the Internet, this bot is held together by duct tape and spaghetti and magically magically works. Use at your own risk.

I would not recommend "borrowing" our code because there are way better resources out there.

(the wolfram thing is kinda neat though)
