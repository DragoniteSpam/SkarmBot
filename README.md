# SkarmBot

A starting-from-scratch rewrite of the glorious Skarm Bot. The goals of this rewrite are:

 - the entire code base shouldn't be crap
 - the entire code base shouldn't all be in one impossible-to-read file
 - the entire code base shouldn't be reminiscent of [this](https://xkcd.com/1513/)
 - the entire code base shouldn't be impossible to add new things to
 - if my co-authors could pretend to have some idea of what "code style" is that'd be a plus too
