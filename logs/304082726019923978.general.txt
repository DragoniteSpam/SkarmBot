i haven’t played overwatch in a while
rarity pkushie made in the uk
henlo wolve
classmate rolled his truck after drinking and driving

platinum was the last game to have it
in the newer generations they kinda made red a pushover
coffee drinker
that's the smell of nature, you fool
it just might overhaul though.
they charge money for use of the mods content.
that's a good idea.

i assume you are talking about your grandma, and if you really want her to shut up ask her about m-81
the case shouldn't affect your flash drives like that
you already do, ninny
i'm honestly more excited for that time around since i'll be playing gunner xp
i don't want there to be too much lag
so i don't have to do that ^^^
that means you swung to attack.
good
also i came very close to mistyping "weilds ass" which would be a sight to see
you really like to steal doors, huh rc
why do i have the bad feeling he's going to abuse that emote
i wonder if "greater masa mune" will ever be a thing. <:thinkingking:325447327940870145>

i mean if worse comes to worse (i have no idea if i used this right or if it's written properly) you could always use the *"legal"* roundabout method of installing windows. although, idk if you can do that on a laptop.
i thought it was all in good fun but it was actually meant for me to feel bad
new super mario bros ds was another option but i done the let’s play 4 times and it requires the bot screen
“prick”
i already promise not to have a huge freakout ever since the october 8th 2016 at 7pm incident
okay then
i didn’t. although i was feeling slightly more upbeat today
no squid that’s inappropriate
i mean he's practically banned from this server anyways
what do you guys feel about randomizers
i could have done 1804 or 1815
it's not that, it's just that my internet is going to make things a pain because of constant buffering
dragonite, smack him with a frying pan if you please. =w=

<:lul:305559915714576385>

only reason im not aggressive in civ was ida telling it’s not a good idea
and they started asking me advice
(drago, put an icon on your alt, you lazy bum)

btw side tangent i saw someone wrongly say "i believe in you" and said "i believe at you" and i refuse to say the correct way
and it only really gives you the bonus ad for the brief time frame when you're in combat.

my favourite mod wanted us to be a trio

thats where the secret money comes in
oh look it's after one in the morning and all ive done in the last hour is google "whats the point of 4chan"

"do you really want these kinds of people on the _normal_ part of the internet?"

i think i gotta restart my laptop or just log out
yeah
but that really is me
so for some reason i decided to look through my teacher's github thing to see what he'd been working on
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ

as soon as something went into motion it wouldn't stop

ive been in the atlantic before and theres no sharks

5 pages long, the average lesson is about 10 pages or sometimes even crazier like 15 pages
it tastes like stale nothing
ooooh nice
neato
i dont mind english
if you get understood who gives a fuck
im surprised you found a way to open a box that had no door on it
most of my dms is me either shitposting, having a mental breakdown, or nsfw things
so i guess you can throw windows out of windows if you envision the object your throwing out as a window
if there was no uni i'd prolly reach kilwala in one day
that's all im gonna say on that matter
so i'm worried
welp
didnt i just put you in time-out for wasting food?
no just the comic pages
i had a good response to that but i forgot it
you only blew up the food? that's unusually civilized of you
ok maybe its a *little* bigoted

the fifteenth commandment clearly says that `thou shall not put chocolate and tomato on the same pizza`

plot twist i didnt go to bed i stayed up and read comic anthologies for two hours
i got all nostalgic when playing pokemon mystery dungeon when i remembered his old vids on those games. it's nice to see his community still active
but no one ever asked for my solution
she would be mistress8998
do you mean patches
thats the best name
he is the largest

allow me this as a late birthday present
by then we had evolved past muskets which were fading out over that century in favor of actual good weapons
i was just gonna move it up a bit but that works too
turn my name back to green! pls
that and industrial age was end of colonial and final nail in the mideival coffin
you tell me dragonite how easy is it to eat one?

better than infinitely bad is still infinitely bad
idapoo would also work but ideepoo sounds better

well go get a cat
that's a noni
appreciate it buddy

the only thing about that service that i'm still unlikely to try out is nintendo's voice chat. i know they're oldschool with a lot of their decisions, but a mobile app for online voice chat makes little sense even for their standards
i like that

he wants us to collect data together and i just wanna do it solo halp
*smacks cipher* this bad boy can block so many people
add me if you want
am or pm
this is nothing.
so how did you decide i would get that one?
estimated time to takeover: 6-10 years
new pokemon looks amazing
nope
thats the time that matters
learning games
he wouldnt take the thing with him
so much frigging effort
im up for grinding now btw
because windows 7 is great and windows 8 and windows 10 aren't.
nope
me hungry
whatcha up to
more like that microsoft charges $100 per year for their software
remember how i joked about doing my homework a half hour ago? i still havent started
also t=+3.25 hours and still cant sleep
you're a plant?
all the other days are just night, for there is no sun
like how there’s a venom movie without spider-man
spazzer you haven't lived until you've beaten games that are older than you are
i had no reference so i thought they were good
demon lord stop being old
my hearing is pretty bad
i swear to god axi s3 only starts appearing at night
speaking of skyrim
emo spiderman.
the sad part about me gambling is that this is actually more fun than the game itself...
hmm, bella's not muted that is quite the rare sight
it's from that one berenstein bears book
which is very tiny but almost looks vaguely familiar
i mean water can be synthesized as a product of cellular respiration and stuff
i guess i'll just have to live with this minor annoyance
why is that even a question
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i too like panada's
i actually updated right after the update since it failed to install an update
but i still think they need their own loveroms/emuparadise type of system instead of what they got for the nes games
twitter is the best social network there is, but that's like saying that
you should joint he party
if i wasn't so lazy i'd dig out the discord join/drop sound effects and then play them infinitely into my mic just to confuse you
flubs let's be honest
master are you compensating for something
bye pnada
i remember drawing a snowy owl for a project back in third grade all you see is a giant bird with tiny stick like legs and feet lol xd
i update it monthly
its not a toggle
in other news dogs in cars are fun
be at worlds
i played as waluigi i think
i believe so
or an array of booleans
today “drop the whole fucking team”
bella and aminal
i mean
which is their week 1
nice
can you display that to three significant digits?
hey kugal
see pins
good job discord mobile
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
last year, the most passive aggressive class(es) were geometry, earth science, algebra 2, and thats about it, they were all equally passive aggressive
yo anyone want hate i got a spare
i just got a spare flow if anyone needs it
hey kugal
can i have any leftover tacos?
what skarm
thats where we get tacos
what are the reqs?
last i checked soma was considered good
i'm waiting until a friend gets up to tell me
i'm in the mission
speaking of cacti, has that one guy said anything recently?
i prefer that
this does not bode well
trippy smooth version
darn
because their solidifying the fact that im not a moron and i can actually do the material
i will give you some of my leftover popeyes chicken
nice
be nice flubs
so i have an hour before class starts so im screwing around in the computer lab trying to salvage my writing thing, and the more i read it the more i hate it
anyways brb playing aatrox
a massacre
this is changing the subject a bit but my teacher wanted to do audio stuff in js today
though some are admittedly purposely made stupid, for jokes
because people use the definition of stupid so loosely, getting a fact wrong makes some people go from sir isaac newton to nemrod in some people's eyes
if you bend it far enough _everything_ can be an integral sign
well who knows maybe i deserve it
should probably also farm derilect survival for octavia more
because i was boosted and briefly thought guardian was aftershocik
i oddly enjoy looking at stuff i can’t buy and have no use for
both places were good but we go to lowes more now
rona is better
flubs i love how worked up youre getting over this
sure
poor you <:kappa:374346980136058893>
previews are nice sometimes

![]==[]
maybe you could try loading it into a water pistol
as a computer engineer my solution to problems is usually rebooting, blaming the programmers, or throwing more resources at it
he comes every two weeks
i had someone in my server thinking the nazis were good...how does this happen in a non public server
and drago can be a guest on the show
let people major how they wanna major
it missed obviously.
thankfully i only need get the intro paragraph done by the end of this week, but i'll probably try to put out an entire draft so i have a bit of a buffer.
firefox > chrome anyways
tmw your code doesnt work all afternoon and you finally figure out why
i'm in the middle of figuring out how to use the wikipedia api to generate content for my homework assignment for me
ah, gotcha
i got 1 fact wrong on my astronomy lab and that dropped the grade by 10%
for three hours
nothing
and they sell for more typically
ham is gross
lemonade
i can't believe i got all of ember's stuff in the minimal possible runs
when i met him i was more successful
oh yeah that one was hard
oh hell no
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
who had the changed
i’m not into the camera work at aaaaallll
remember stay single and don’t do hard drugs

i remember back in 2nd grade i really liked ham and cheese sandwiches
i still blame youtube for why i hate film class
im not single
often 8 +
drago
there is tension
hah. time zones.
gotta do 5 waves with objective taking no damage on lvl 30+
kavat cudes up rn if you need them
damn sleep
or maybe just that boy with the hat
how is that going?
too bad i still have no idea how to get bacon in this game
just get my sister to entertain her
what
i want the frame for myself but im probably not gonna go all out like for rhino
first day of fall and it should be 90+
she is sick though
i did use a spreadsheet to check myself though
:dragonitewasamistake:
same
~~wasn’t the internet always stupid?~~
but then again driving on li looks horrible
25th
through x^.5 form or?
man one assignment for literature takes a few solid hours, its impressive
yea i think i may just use double factorial
i’ve come to realize i’d rather be happy and doing what i like than be unhappy and dreading work everyday
im guessing itd just be the factorial of the factorial of the original number
who?
i should teach kids war
play them my songs in return
oh yeah peaceful places
how the fuck will more music help me hear less music
basically i am gonna take everything i learn over the years for this
stellacor

3 teralysts, one gantalyst, and one hydrolyst

win + x -> u -> r
yeet selling out is awesome
its just slush
nice
oh wait my sub expired
there are phones that cost over $2000?
the people you go on discord with
to mot
not looking forward to walking to the bus stop in -20 weather tho
also new york snow is fuckin garbage
allows you to take an aura like corrosive projection
i nearly died
it’s cool that they gave a riven
what's the challenge?
sounds fun
whats the difference between a butt ton and a normal ton
gonna try to sleep now
like +30% strength
guys
as per usual
i realize drago has beaten me in every social media
oh you mean ripping off of r/writingprompts class
that takes skill
i think you mean a shit ton
maybe i can misspell all of the names a different way every time and see if anyone notices
gonna go watchwestwing();}
they can *do* that?
break time
or if you're behind the times, impact font.
would corrosive font be writing with acid?
i dont think this one has a right answer
everything's a library card if you bribe the librarian with enough
and when you die it stops being your problem
that's what "formatting" means right
basically
as you know, fred
that was master's bad idea not mine
16,318,782 as of whenever the public count was last updated
actually
oh hey alan walker is in top 100
mines on the top
rc have you even _seen_ this guy's content
i love the 18th century
16,318,782

thats probably how the fcc feels about public comments tho too
virginia tech? yeah they sent me recruiting information well into my twenties also
oh yeah in dark brotherhood questline you murder the emperor while hes on his ship
oh i forgot that i blocked mee6
indeed.  welcome to our little slice of discord.

my first class gives quizzes exactly at the start.. it sucks
vote'); drop table candidates --;
it's cold therefore it's christmas
also my nose runs
thank you
that sounds cruel and unusual
get the dynamite
this whole mornings real odd
then again
i remember we got papers or something about it in high school but i never read them
hey theres plenty other things to talk about
maybe if you throw it fast enough you can knock out the power cord or something
i did a really good typo earlier
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
exactly
is this like part of your morning routine or something
very badly
thats a first of those
and there are no paper cartridges

so the first piece and second piece should have the same derivative value at x = 0
thanks
but is it differentiable?
brb pretending to be productive today
my brain is 50% ponies 50% war
or you could say a= -2/x
i wasn't complaining, i was just giving my thoughts based on what i've heard
it's not about whether you can afford it, it's about what you're getting in return
becoming school teacher is harder than it looks
is rate my professor a working thing in canadialand
too late doing calc first
the classes are way tougher than film
just saying personally, but the 4 years are a literal 4 commitment so it’s the same thing
final*
i started taking ap chem as a sophomore but then dropped it because i was barely even going to class
i think the highest for freshman here is bio
im in such a good mood
well that’s easy
ok enough of being a huge nurd, time to do dog chores brb again
also i apparently have no role in that sheet
i should probably tag him hun
it’s normal probably
you have no valid point
is that a good thing or a bad thing
it’s not surprising, but official
because i do the dumb
was that because you didnt speak english or because you answered "musket" for every question
should have learnt french instead
i have poems to read. hopefully
i got chewed out in first grade
leave'er johnny leaver ohh leaver johnny leavr. for the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
a special fuck you to the guy who looked right at me while i was downed vs the gustrag three in a nitain mission and didn't revive me

legitimate question: what's wrong with using a ternary operator?
i have places to be so i'm just gonna leave
almost all research is done, shadow clan
none of that matters why the fuck would you put that in your resume to literally everything
also this is happening
sitting is comfortable and rising is hard
they also have metal
if it was easy everyone would do it
more or less <:gwovoraphixd:390538507799494658>
thats the boy
i like it when my code is a metaphor for my entire life
jupiter
no it would probably be the timestamp of the last time the page was edited
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay hiccupping again
here we see the dragonite taking a half hour to get out of bed as he continues to fiddle around with his metal spaghetti dinner from last year
i thought it was unusually sane in here but i assumed that squid just left the window open again
it keeps fuckin changing
oh, so he's too busy getting x to divide by zero to get y
and slap this one girl at bronycon i hate
that...doesnt make sense
yeah
lies
okay then
and nitain
nah that sounds like work
snorlax

warframe is good tho
you go on the google and look up snakes. they teach you codes
times this one by 20
not doing any classes on it
"here's a template lab that someone turned in in 2007, just copy and paste some words and add a table of your results and write me two sentences for why your results don't match mine and you get a 95"
my friggin college calculus course is easier than my high school honors course
the directions are equal to "ok go and do it have fun!"
and i was never told to start working on it, only that it was due monday
like spaghetti or people
also what the fuck how do teachers have enough time to grade all this stuff and still make tests and shit
but it's due monday
yeah
my favorite part is when you catch the black hole at just the right angle and you can see an image of yourself without needing a mirror
ghosts dont scare me they make me feel safe
i know only of blitzypoo
i been noticing my mood changing quick

<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>

okay no wonder my peanut butter is wet
i realize something

coffee sucks <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i could not agree more

im in a computer lab now and dont feel like discording on my phone
dragonite happy
trains are nice

i just feel like this list is missing a few things
believe it or not
and a boat fishing mode
man life is so much calmer without thunder everywhere always
theres no underwater infestation
oh no
flubs please refrain from doing pg-rated things with the bot
play the lottery on when my next song comes out

\:thinking\:
theres not that many pink nu to choose from
that fuckin fat kid ruined the show
right as you say that one of my cats tries to sit on the face of the other
it's art

i was just surprised
thanks this is confusing panda
i mean this wouldn't be the first time he's attempted to save something
mine is usually somewhere between -100 and 5000
saturn

urgent question: is everclear safe to drink
mix it with koolaid
cutting everclear with water?
then you'll know pain <:rooderp:399827526744014848>

i'm great at men
i almost fell in love
and some lucky fellow's, at some point

i’m not down for this
i prefer standing tall in empty fields in thunderstorms
im pretty sure if you read enough bible you could find at least one or two instances of god being a knob to jesus
it's like that but an anime
idk maybe i just got used to them as a kid
oh hey
my sympathy has been replaced with contempt
10/10
dragonite dont do it now

.....

well yeah hes getting up there but his son wasnt too old
great so header formatting doesnt work on discord i want a refund
its fuckin gross
i mean theres no way he *isnt* but its a question of to what extent is he
even though i’m not bad at formal essays, doesn’t mean they’re enjoyable
let me guess
then there's no way to get a refund.
so refund your nitro subscription.``` <:kappa:374346980136058893>
of bugs
i uh...... no
you've been tricked
but its nice
because si
did you try turning them off and turning them on again
is the frame slot the issue?
one of them i’m too sleepy to try.
the easy one is 10 slide kills without damage
that might have been a different game though but im pretty sure it was xenoblad
reyn time basically the most well known meme that is not "i'm really feeling it" from that game
i don't remember seeing one like that either
who here is dumb?
ive had that happen twice and waited it out both times
so i stopped doing it
redemption arc’s fine
but i learn an important lesson, that caring is often enough to get us through and to be happy
<:rooaww:399827525599232000>
that one almost doesn't seem thematically correct
grab it asap
my bus broke down 😂

baseball
what pirates do
sense of pride and accomplishment
i need to mod my skyrim
it's also got an eta of never because it's an entire aaa sized game being made by a few people in their free time on a rapidly obsoleting engine
they’re just windows stuff before 7
does that matter though
i use an adblocker so who cares if they target ads
and you wanted to get insurance
if you accidentally broke a table because you didn't know that would happen if you swing an axe on it, that's something you had control of
i don't know is on third.
yeah i did one of those a while ago
enjoy spending money on shit you don't have to because "it's the way capitalism is'
you're hopeless.

if you can’t fill out a resume without help, how do you expect to live on your own?
this also confuses
if you tell a woman you’re jealous of her beard, you better be ready to get thrown to the moon
even if i live away from my parents now
you have a play skyrim button on your keyboard?
all of my facial hair is around my neck

idk if this should be here or memes but lo;
hey i know what i should do
i will
i didnt play harvest moon

you mean there are people who _dont_ show their passport when asked for id

they were sitting around 32-33 dollars a share a few weeks ago now theyre at like
mmm, how so
base twelve would be awesome
and i mean im bad with people
its the execution that gets you in trouble
also theres nothing illegal about *wanting* to pour boiling hot water down someones throat

windows wants to update and is giving me the option to do it either now or now

skarm say brb

drago
hey want me to be your anivia coach?
leason
tbh i never actually care about converting people to bronies just for jokes but i still converted someone
but other people
following does nothing though
also is it bad
i assume you meant follow
talking to me is great ida
of course we don’t always have pony talk but you get the picture
good thing i left that server when i did
why is base12 good?
i'm so lonely

my server is dead, two pony servers are too noisy
oh wait my power is back so i can toilet again
only one?
kick/ban

exactly, theyre always annoying self-centered asses
he didnt even look at the damn directions on how to complete the assignment
as do i
you should read the directions on how to complete the assignment before taking up 4 hours of your fellow student's time
thats fair
also its probably a lot easier to have adult intervention offline if they see it happening
i need a full size version  of it to comprehend
in college its full of people who are millions times more humble and they're just more real
thats dumb
yeah remembering an infinite set must be a swell time

~~yeah, just ignore that last message of mine~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>

do you want to be married?
maybe i should lol
vortex is dead
like there's so many other things you can use that money for
but my social life been boomin recently and i just dont have much chill time anymore
also it supports out skyrim supports voiced languages like polish and japanese and stuff. i should set my language to that and see if i can still understand anything.
but dual wielded
nobody at work knows tho
and theyre hazy as fuck even with my glasses on
<:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
yep, that's how uni is
youd think there was a bunch of dust in there or something but there isnt
i didnt diss it

tbh i haven’t seen any college kid smoke
oh god, there’s a chance for snow a little north from here 😑
i have never seen this game in my life so i don’t want to ask what it is
its not
comic book plotline?
i saw the previews and i am very ready for it
though impressive
im just...?
very slight but very much liked
the fuck is a syllabus?
oh well fnatic is from eu
like super super hard
i want you to be super hard on me
so, thisll be fun
i'm alive
you know is it bad that im still not done my essay due last monday

i think so
and flubs you would not like this person
i can get a slice of pizza at school for 2.65 but it doesnt taste very good

well yeah. its cod. thats to be expected. shitty, but expected
it’s not good to have lol
so far your friend’s not bad
fight my enemies yes
(this is totally not based off of a stackoverflow question i saw a little while ago)
its a special arrangement of only the finest ~~volatile death orbs~~ vitamin rich frenchless unfrieds
considering i don’t think you’ve had this chain before i’d be ok with that
i'm right on the edge basically
and if i flirt with her punch me hard
i’m an east coast boi because i live here and don’t travel
burgers for dinner is good
time stops love
hmm i dont feel like working on game but i dont feel like nto working on game help
flubs hates everything
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>

time to buy prime junk
or did you feel like batman?
i need like 3-4 of those
your dog is dead
we're only  touching a tiny bit on integration but im like amazing at integration, so that's little worry to me
since we're still in q1 here
and make that annoying dragon that spawns by the college turn into a pile of living chickens on death
i do not insist
i had no school today yet i still did some school work
i don’t want it to work like that
hmm there's one section where one of the graybeards uses a gendered pronoun when talking about the player character, i wonder if they correctly change it if you play as a girl or if they just assume nobody would notice
looks like the only boss frames i need now are mesa, atlas, and nekros
my love life
usually, though
i feel like im cheating
aight
i might be able to, but not quite right now
it was like after 40 mins in before 48
i can kinda see that
guys i think skyrim is a singularity
well from my perspective, a full time job may help since it's more consistent in terms of hours.  though i'm not certain.
i slept for 14 hours but woke up early
i couldn’t stay asleep for that long unless you killed me
sorry
i just got done playing skyrim 15 minutes ago
and you don’t have it on your switch or pager or rock
that's $50,000 an hour and you've been here for at least thirty seconds
because some aspects of programming are more complex than rocket science.
what does that mean
i kind of want to know what would happen if you set up a battle with like five hundred participants using my code
play skyrim
i have become crazy
20 or 40?
maybe a shiba
happy womb escape day
k back
im not sure if i just complimented you or insulted you
rip zeal wheel: he had a short life
i can’t give up on league when i never played it in the first place <:kappa:374346980136058893>
took care of dragon

there’s only a couple shows where that’s ok
at most
can't take away a whole pc <:kappa:374346980136058893>
but my mom is bad w computers so i'm gokd
wanna play my games but ehhhh
i realize something
"can i pronounce its name?"
damn
haha time to make fun of a movie
can't find the account though
i found 36 ds and 45 gameboy advanced/color games in a box of my old stuff
its fine in sandwiches but doesnt work well in ice cream or candy imo
so more i go to get

wtf fnatic
not bandwagoning
anyone can win
when did it become 10
whos aqua
~~aqua is now magma.~~
of course they aren't bad
long term it may be a better move
rikara did not deserve to go play at worlds at any capacity
i rather see them than 100 thieves at worlds
im hearing aphro wanted meteos kicked and cody sun out
they already knew they wouldn't have wom
they could have let him one game since he worked all year to get them to worlds
obviously rikara was playing in challenger series for one year and academy for most of this year
could make sense though
you don't know that
well shit, how am i supposed to come up with that money?
no reason for him to
its your brother
agrewd
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i’m back from work ya ninnies. and eyan is streaming
gonna do one more run for the night
i just made the "all required move effects do their job" milestone, the question is, do i keep going or do i finally just play skyrim
i just kinda wish my midterm would get graded already so i can see the horrible score i know i got
like if i dont show my work in the best way he usually wont care, as long as i came to the right conclusion and he knows its my honest work i get full credit
still no octavia
so that fucking joey with 100 metapods doesnt beat you by running you dry on pp
my profs don’t even let you see questions you missed if you didn’t get to class early enough
i need to dump some cause im at 14/15 rn
the only thing i dont really like much about the class is how some questions we are tested on but arent explained how to do them properly
i mean yeah if i choose arceus or dialga or something i'd just look like an egomaniac
and it's been 5 minutes
in practice the above is false
these are closely guarded doctoring secrets
and i wouldn't have met you guys
and smelled like perfume
normally yes but when it's you they're smiling at one should probably start worrying for their sanity
top ten things said before disaster
that sounds like a euphemism for something to do with the toilet doesn't it
i think you’re becoming 
i got a fiora bug fixed by getting on the front page of r/lol once
now to do it with all the consonants. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
**normal**
i forgot about that
i have a meeting with a prospective school but there was nothing that was said i had to prepare... so i have no idea what i need
delusional
plus it ain't exactly hard to fake degrees <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
🎉 good job aminal

squid is playing skyrim
personally i think im pretty great
where is my sister
she broke up with me
oh my
i am?
the smoke detector just went off and dragonite's dog.exe has stopped working
no it doesnt
you dont hear anyone going "dear ideal masters ill trade you this dark soul gem for a spicy alchemy buff"
theyre still not part of the game's files though
hey man dont judge the dwarves on their cooking techniques
so did the dwarves get yote or just kinda fuck off and stop existing?
but should i really?
incantations are probabaly part of summoning
i know right
is dragonite awake _before 10:30 for once?_
this is non-negotiable
play it safe and ask in the morning. people interrupting your mindflow is punishable by death
think it would be safer if i asked an hour later?
in other news the wikipedia page of "list of numbers" is pretty good too
thats got whats his name
youtube shut up im not voting for any of them stop telling me who to vote for
havent seen it
theres only one i actually want to see
i miss the office. probably going to rewatch it
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
for the past 3 hours
my hair is too messy
dare i ask why you are on your phone?
yeah i ate a baby
i'm pissed btw since sakurai won't get the satisfaction of revealing these characters now because of this leaker showing off all of the remaining characters
i just looked the lyrics up
but anyway my rant is over now
that is not a chaurus
but seriously batman and robin is better than the dark knight
if it wasnt intended
just move duh
making sure you're the right guy here btw, is that you flubs?
wasn't even working on the wired computer
the wifi isn't out
no it was my old flipphone
hello kugals
i hate phone typing
big enough where i don't fuck up and press another button
i uninstalled skype
i only used it for 2 things
i sort of understand that, my hands were really shaking after playing on my ps3 for a while
but who gives a fuck its easy to use
i must know these laws
i have to actually look at what i'm typing if i have to use a touchpad
yea he said he had tog o
it isnt even about cold i just have a weird feeling in my hands and wish for it to not be so annoying. if i wear gloves i dont have to put as much pressure on my fingertips
i remember that
the what now
good point
im great at saving money gum
tell me what he said so i can say it too
i can't spell
the forsworn are nice they have cookies and only try to kill you on some days
but i figured out what the joke was gonna be
because it's like
good job gum
did someone steal his sweetroll?
idk how females work
hey sis wanna move in with me for a day?
i am depressed
asking for a friend
oh - dah - ving

that was four and a half hours ago now
night at 5 am
im in bed before my sis
guess whose monitor broke the night she needs it
blitzypoo is next in line
my classes hardly have gotten cancelled this semester and i don’t approve
the females only have bad luck though because you keep trying to talk to them
thats the best
yeah i'm surprised there's that many too
pfft
either or
interesting
i'm not either but it makes my inner seven-year-old giggle
panda's here who wants to talk about butts
amen to that one
see ya drago
night drago
i’m just lazy and did an all in one kind of character
she is 19
i can hook drago up with a girl
also did i say i was going to sleep? i lied i got distracted by reddit
how old is she
you and her go out
but jesus that reminds me im gonna be 17 in like a couple of months
im gonna invent it for the lonely and desperate though
everyone wins
does that help
my parents want the opposite
~~sleep is for the weak and squid~~
plot twist i never slept
good job?
is the twitter-removing-the-like-button thing real or did i forget to wake up this morning
why didnt dragonite see said email?
so anyway, i drove a half hour to class, only to find out that class was cancelled
guess who got an email saying that class was cancelled!
that’s not the reason you should have to dislike this happening...
i recorded stuff earlier. need to edit it sometime
oops didn't see you there
needs more letterboxing
i should probably record something
#getidaoutside
my desk drawer is jammed shut and that's where i keep my wii remotes
you too
maybe revise that sentence
shit i needed ida since idk how to food shop
so sad. i already miss its weird screeching and rubbing sounds
well i eat like what the soldiers ate in the 18th/19th century
just buy food
is it even that good for you
is what good for you
instant coffee
honestly
and i loved it
both on pc and phone
provolone is pretty good but mozzarella is better
i have notifications turned off
this will be the stupidest thing i ever do
becaues that'll take forever
one of my programming teachers told me i failed the midterm because i answered all six qurstions instead of choosing five
i know that, deci
nick valentine has the same voice actor as belethor and a bunch of other minor skyrim characters
silly dragonite its not the pastime its the career
okay, so where you do want me to put this lighter fluid at?
dont do that its bad
its so very fair and balanced that he gets a free soul charge
honestly i think a lot of people would stay in the server if they were greeted by a bot calling them a fuckwad and saying he was gonna murder them
buy food to make into food dont buy instant shit
so basically the whole ordeal
im curious now
his excuse was that he has bipolar disorder
depends on the topic
i have uploaded all of my 2014-2015 super mario 3d land videos
but they have tacos and burritos
you should do a histiry essay on tbe history of history essays
the best thing ever
that’s how i was until 2016
drago
and walmart in the frozen food aisle
i also like cheese
like some people do
which makes you eligible for a parking ticket
the latter
so i'm in no way tempted.
it's a dessert pastry made of phyllo bread, filled with a mixture of crushed nuts, and held together with a syrup.
i came in to class
blackwake is on sale
despite someone gifting it to me
then yes its good
your body wants you to get coffee ice cream instead 😉
and then there's stuff like the halting problem and the unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics
also take everythign i say with a grain of salt, im just angry, i dont mean anything i say
i don’t, so i don’t know why i want one
just to give ya an idea
maybe
im doing it, i cant let today happen again
or that you can’t be accessed by them, so they’d know it anyway
the focus is all just from running eidolon hunts
delete it
good choice kugal
no flubs and not robot
where are my dating advisors?
cool thanks
lies
good luck
people are pretty adamant about getting their candy
im not too fond of halloween
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
f indeed
well that was tragic
shit i would be older than my big sis
im kinda curious to see what she'll say lol
it's ok, there's always next time
okay thanks but
im asking her out thursday
we live like the 18th century
that is not a pick up line
enjoy
perfect
sooo if i date her
i always want to try chick-fil-a
jeesh its almost 4, where did time go
i dont think thats how it works bud
dare i ask what his response was?
i went out of a bathroom
interesting
i should probably install a virtual machine with ubuntu or something
with spongebob
i can’t get my head around it
but the c did not accept the peace treaty
sounds fun. might be able to later
they had a strange start schedule but its evened out
pls use code word
i guess they didnt make any in the years i played nintendo games
i dont think i played anything on the gamecube
i was busy
when elder scrolls 6 is cancelled, dragonite
we're fucked
why has no one used pick up lines on me?
secrecy
nobody has it also how the fuck do you get robbed by a me
places arent open
i think the elven dagger has the fastest swing rate
oh wait
master its cursive
i found someone im smarter than
<:doit:334014889137930240>
nice
sot has more content, which is saying something
a majority of my diet is frozen food and cold cut sandwiches
that doesn't seem right to me
howd you get that funky n
ahhh
<:doit:334014889137930240>
ida aren't you taller than most people
i hate you
i'm popeye the sailor man, i'm popeye the sailor man! i'm strong to the finish 'cause i eat me spinach, i'm popeye the sailor man!
guys
she’s basically a vegetarian
xenoblade it is
i have an opportunity to record xenoblade today, the question is, can i be bothered to turn my wii u on
i think i did
shouldve replied "because your mom told me"
predicted death date: 8 december 2057
wait you have your normal icon how did you do that?
lmao even wolfy doesn't like "to-mah-to"
better than canadian weather
so thats $60 an hour for private security and $2600 for the flight and hotel
i will pay for her food though
i have to do a paper... but its also halloween.
he probably swapped back after that screencap was taken.
unless dragonite feels like staying up till 2 as usual
hmmm
ftp is for like lettuce and cabbage and stuff though there really should be a separate protocol for the important stuff
tcp stands for "the candy protocol" right
academic or professional?
uhhh
nice nice
i do get made fun of too if i slightly grow it out
when is paper skyrim coming out
also probably why i don’t like them
<:doit:334014889137930240>
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
oh they definitely are
halloween is dumb people dont even look like scary
im a kaiser
i think halloween is moreso a fashion show now
perfect <:lul:305559915714576385>
hey man i profit regardless
that's not what i was going for
you record your office?
i hate halloween
awww whyd i do that
and its not fun
like so many times i wish micheal would bully her hard
depending on context, especially the dwight one
but i love ryan
he left his kid at the end so what? he's cool
the office
not on netflix
because spoopy memes
im gonna do that next time
pffft haha
there is a 25% chance she will say no
since beef
with what sleeping? <:gwcentralpikalul:377110562116468766>
works for me a little too well
jeez that box office is a lot
also that ^
<:rooblank:399827527289536512>
he is lonely
i think usually do almond milk
weird, i can do that soon
and i usually take my coffee skim and 0-3 sugars depending on the day
panda, let's go get coffee
or like straight as an arrow
i start every morning with a triple mixed with milk and chocolate protein powder
minié rifle
post malone? <:roothink:399827523581771796>
but now i'm gonna make sure she thinks you're hideous
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
besides you can't hurt me rainy
i am a hair person
and that i should stick to history
i got acne on my forehead as well
i am gonna kill her tomorrow!
my own sister against gum
because eventually you cross a line and you go back to us and ask what you did wrong.
me neither (sorta)
on purpose
my grave!
i told her she is the best
i think i’ve only seen an episode of scrubs
i just said she has more than you.
i prefer a slumber party
bam roasted
it’s like what me and drago so
oh look it's three in the morning how'd that happen bye
i wouldn’t know what to order. i should try that out
it’s fake
if you like white chocolate go with that
so what's the other option bella?
cause thats the most common answer
of what the literal differences were
what do i sound like? some attractive guy that all girls fall in love with?
real men play mario kart
smash just gets way too much hype and attention
next week boys next week....
mario kart 9 is happening?
okay well i blame flubs
good enough for me, thanks guys
because i left cookies and milk for santa once
wonderful, thank you
that certain emperor is me
a character from xenoblade if i'm not mistaken
and i can’t say i want more from the game because tons of people will call me selfish or ungrateful and say i should be happy with what we already got. fucking stupid
how do you know that
oh flubs she got sick tomorrow
yeah, i guess that’s a point
there you go
him too
worth it if it works
in fact i appreciate it
what did you say to you know who when you asked her out?
flubs
but fell in college love
no problem
so i would say they were sweet?
its only two late when one or both people are dead
what else?
i wouldn’t care unless they were still dating someone
not an a hole
just have no self esteem
there arent really more though
depends who i don’t like
you mean my little one or ida?
well good luck with that whole thing. personally ive given up on relationships because i suck at them
and upset
in my life time
yet you were in the hospital waiting for her
although skyrim would technically be useful in that it would prevent me from eating any more candy and that's probably a good thing
i need someone to help me grocery shop
ahaha no
nobody goes to the arcade anymore
i'll buy wine
no offence ida i know you would
why is the library a choice?
so i would have to pick
just think in less than a year you'll be able to go to a bar
probably helps not to limit it to one place
farmers market it is
there is this good ice cream place...
or what bella said
that is benny's date
not mine
is there a stream right now?
i lost my gba and my ds with the slot in the bottom
i got rejected
true
tuesday no matter what
yes you can
i doubt even _he_ knows honestly
but can i ask when will king of zeal/superskarmory will be back recording for youtube again?
that kid who i blocked, his brother confronted me about it in the middle of class
i am a disappointment to myself
skyrim
yay?
well i wish i saw that edit sooner
<:lul:305559915714576385>
"we got to have.... *moneyyyyyy*"
>that sad moment when you realize you have a stronger connection with piranha plant with the games you've played over the characters in the fake banner/grinch leak since you haven't played those characters games
i'm not sure on how many stages we got with smash 4's dlc btw
the german empire anthem is amazing
like why do you care, lol
bummer we didn't get smash run though, but oh well
the "not-so-great" maze.
hopefully there's not going to be another stupid great maze again
yes its more chill than secunda, dragonite
and then it turns into who cares about a boyfriend when you can get an a in calculus
how many square tomatoes is it if each tomato is 3
like i said to that certain person i saw, he could always be dlc
which is better than platforming imo
i have my character predictions ready for the dlc
nah, just felt like saying it
still gunning for elma and joker, though i have my doubts.
it probably wasn't important right
this isn't in any order btw
who probably got it from somewhere else
for the record i didn't invent you rang i got it from foxtrot who got it from the addams family
i could have invaded canada with all of my stupid high school videos
oh you know what it's private
i guess if you have steam 2fa enabled you should grab your phone too but only if you own skyrim
you said yeet like 6 years before it became common
and the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade and told of bold lies and the gold he had made
how did i miss that
i actually dont really like the smb3 overworld
so greenland is on white witch time
also i played x in italian once even though i can only read like ten words of italian and was fine so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
the 90s were a mistake
other n64 games aged decently, sm64 was not one of them
i loved playing as them
anyways, i have nothing to do until stephen’s extra life stream starts in around 3 hours
destiny 2 is supposedly free until nov 18 but i cant find where tf the free version is downloadable
and i tend to call myself a cat so that makes me a furry
-----.----
good maybe i should not give a shit more often
...----...·-·-·---.......------..---
yeah
..-...-...--......--
and it actually takes months unless you pay money
·-·-·-----.---.....--
see if the achievements were no hit a boss or complete the game at sl1 thatd be fun
you know what better than that
like i just dont enjoy the action of eating
poor paris
run from it
im also wondering this
as much as i would love to see everything go down, i have work tomorrow afternoon
peggy still arives
dread it
are they nice?
aint nobody cooler than this dan
be a shut in neet who hasnt seen the sun in two years
amazing island is *already* back in fifth
sup pham, i just got a switch, so if u got one and wanna add me, here’s my friend code.
i wake up at 6 for work. makes me feel like i have a productive day
yeet
sleeping doesnt make me less tired
i woke up at 9 today and really wasn’t into it
1 am
maybe ida
i do indeed
you get used to it.
well gives me a few days to work out what i wanna say to her
interesting
it hurts
i still dont know *what* magfest is
perfect drago
it's also a secret excuse to eat hamburgers all weekend because all of the other food in the area is either expensive or trash but dont tell my mom i said that
its directly across the sound from me and they have cheap crab and cheap alcohol
he has hair like you
i give you my presence
drink alone in sadness and cryu
wing together a perfectly calculated setup
it's like 1974
i spent 1 hours before i fell asleep watching musket videos
i think you're a bit too concerned about the layout but if it makes you happy and gives ya something to do, go for it
freedom it is
wait stream is on now?
thats why
only convention i know what i want to go to
out with family
when going to nyc we do usually stop at albany overnight to visit friends tho
you should probably do that too
demand your money back
these are quite obviously shrute bucks
guess i'm going to hell (the piece is called the gates of hell btw) lol xd
"let me make my *entire fucking life* public
drive into pillars, is a good insult
you're allowed to run around it if you can't kill it somehow
but i like free experience and money
well i need a script writer
also writing is hard \
flubs, you need to react to more than just the c
that concerns me slightly less than mr. joe on street street knowing everything about my daily life
was a very interesting car ride.
dont google that
i dont have his phone number
they're waffling about somewhere, i'm sure.
how dare she say that
brb class
you tripped over a mouse?
well i need a lawyer and my sis is the only one that knows how to do this law thing from those ace games she played
i have it
it made a really loud nosie
well yes. but sometimes we don't like fractions and prefer decimals

oh wow
also i used a random follower for the boethiah quest and now i feel terrible

okay, because 100%ing mm is not as bad people say it is, and you're also on the remake and not the original
<:lul:305559915714576385>
because video game movies are famous for being well-made and successful
i dont see it

first thing in mind that i think when math is said is calculus
i forget what the other name for the biggest exponent is
is that my cue to spend the next four hours writing code for things other than classwork or
what’s wrong with breakfast
but that method is gold
things it doesnt do right: 68,7634,541
okay the last time i ate breakfast voyager 2 had officially left the solar system, but only just barely
although node probably lets you do it
things it does right: 1
the "getting up before 10:30" part
maybe 4th
i wonder if i can launch both the special edition and the regular edition
yeet
it is bad
earth prolly
someone should collab with me

to be honest
i like war but usually when i am here i think about it more
someone lemme know if thats too harsh, i'm legit not sure
great now i just know my mind is as bad as eyans thanks
this server is not nearly as mentally taxing as some others i'm on

and i thought ida was actually gonna end up like one of them because when eyan's server started she just went super mean to me
im too rough now
and one of them threatens to punch me
you were here yesterday though
ida i need protection

hey heard about that new undertale prequel game?
sorry
and flubs
not the first game
didn't know who it was so i rejected the request
wowee
but back then it was absolute horseshit and no one wanted to pay $60 + a monthly subscription for a shittier version of wow
and probalby even more that ive never heard of
usually just end up getting 50 in one handed and giving up and go full warrior
two handed or some sorta conjurer is what im leaning toward rn
hmmmmm
because i'm terrified
jeez how many ffs are there now
still the same thing in oblivion
but you could conjure armor along with that
i’m very curious to know why some guy has a cut out of what i think is ash’s hat strapped onto his forehead
i have 108 as my iq
i dont like playing as an archer
lab mates and i today picked up beans with different items in the name of science.

mapquest is not a dating app
active?
but i have a rarity beach pic when i pretend to be rarity
thanks i've been up for 3 days
two in the morning is nothing

i'll get back to you in a few days
dont rush yourself kugal
listen, after i more or less dropped off on harvest december after how absurdly long the august arc was, i think i'm at least going to try to get caught up with something that is not 'dragonite tries to read on camera'
that sounds like peripheral abuse
what, did samsung make that mouse? /s
fancy that
panda might know
is stream potato or is it on me
im not drunk im flubs
i’ll take the silence as a yes
yes samsung made it
okay, ,the show more input i guess broke
that brings you to a grand total of 55,682 years in jail or cleaning the toilets in the zeal palace until the end of eternity
what’s eyan streaming? xcom again?
good to know it's still functional i gu—never mind
no he is not
yeah youre definitely up late
vampirism is great though
that sounds like vampirism but worse
but yet you want me?
guys.
i am suspicious
the amount of dog pets that must happen per second is greater than the amount of seconds that happen per second
so someone tell me why my computer mouse is half beaten to death?
never give them back to me ever again
sooo yeah
yeah
dont say that to her please
im trying my best to assist
wait
like?
and yet im kinda down for the similar reason but for me it’s more of
i need that medicine
always wanted to experience a life of a soldier in the 18th century
i won’t ida
go to razer
top ten smartest human beings who broke the system
we get snow
i had fun there
people are always angry there
but you seem to enjoy life
now i don’t
though flubs happens to not get under my skin at all...
tbh most of the reason i dont stew in a pot of self hatred and loathing is because id be justified to and people wouldnt really be surprised
platinum
i like dogs
cats aren’t that bad as i originally thought
im german!!!
like i only dont at this point because i didnt before
im going to the hair salon
actually looks great...
get a mohawk
i know, but that just gives me a few basic ideas
oh no
we've proved that √2 is irrational, we've proved that the number goes on forever, isnt that cool?
ida wanna cut my hair?
you'd think that would be impossible
and thats what makes it so not absurd
hey flubs did you know there's the quadratic equation...and the cubic equation? for cubic functions, functions like x³ and not x²
well, math isn't simple because life isnt simple
i like science and math though! d:
idk maybe the higher level shit is cool but i never did any of that
which is why youre frigging weird
ok mr 100%
if they dont get high state test scores then some bad shit happens to the shcool or whatever
knowing how to do basic multiplication and the primary colors doesn't exactly make you look smart
which leads me to think about war the most when i am here...
you're just gonna buy new ones aren't you
9th grade i took algebra, 10th grade i took geometry and algebra 2
but now it's like the complete opposite
im currently in intro to stat and calc 1
algebra 2 had *some* trig for me
done with my phone call
dinosaurs are fucking awesome
not for me though 😦
here ill teach you about dinos instead
then fuck em
theyre fuckin awesome
bully them back
make them feel useless
do it!
bully them back
why is it not alive
i could win a world record for how stupidly redundant i can be
did someone say steak
butter on cookies?
no theyre like so vanilla that they dont even contain vanilla
why do i have to suck at this game so badly
weird right
is having a good time with your father a bad thing?
yes they have animals with names like kangaroo and wallaby and blue-ringed octopus
the answer is yes
google was actually really disappointing
fuck
im getting flash backs to poems some girls in my highschool wrote
probably
this "3d rendering system" thing is haaaaaaaaaard
not anymore
"shut up my sentret needs the exercise"
right skarm?
i also considered microwave oven and motorized can opener
my calc 1 midterm was stressful enough lol
and then it ends and you are even sadder because it’s over
i fixed my mouse btw
i broke it with a hammer and fixed it with a hammer
poetry for fun is really pleasant
human with a side of aged honey mustard
i like it
155 pounds is a lot tho
is 70 kg a lot and is 20 m/s a lot
not with that attitude
maybe i should just take it up to the roof of the english building and drop it
> is already signed into google drive
will the livestream be live until 11’ish?
imma become an artist
i held!
nahhh
oh, eyan’s streaming
hey ida civ 6 next?
t=+15 minutes and teacher is swearing at git, as usual
i was one of those until i wasnt
but i held on
i really should probably go home but the other people are being so weird it's hard to resist wasting time to see what airhead things they do next
watts aren't a lot
climate change sure is good aint it
at this rate i'm conviced fall just completely disappeared. so now there are only two seasons
and not july
what is a noitarepo
can’t i just create a goddamn palindrome
but then you would need shirts with three sleeves
well flubs they usually flow downhill
but you would definitely pet it 50% more
well
if you know something is a dumb idea
this will be the stupidest thing i ever do
both
everyone gives me a less than 1% chance
rit is not a state university
not a courtroom
nah cuz if i did that i couldnt get on to the night terrors as quickly
first off, mood
and i just made up some 9 year olds new gamertag
second semester was more of the same plus a political science elective
pretty sure that's tje gamertag of a kid on my bus
i like using 489 in names because its very witty and im quite smart
dont enter rem
dude being sad about the future is next level
as i say
i'm in a permanent cycle of mad and sad
this is the biggest time i chased after a girl this deep
this one
i'm falling asleep from boredom at the same time
dragonite, you do cool things, stop
"opportunity"
is it pronounced eye-er or err? who the fuck knows
is hampshire not pronounced with the shur part
that’s the only way i’ve ever said it
black cats always win
i want to pet my dog
i can love both
but she's sleeping in dad's room and i dont want to wake up dad just to pet my dog
unnecessary
demon lord you should upgrade to a dog
nah jk i love my cats too much
why on earth would you want your code to execute _slower_
i remember begging my mom until we got one xd
he's of contrary opinions
you know what pronunciation makes no sense what so ever
on the other, what kinda shitty ass parent would disapprove of a class that helps their kid be healthier and more active
no im lazy
but nowadays cats are easier for me to take care of
i tend not to like the kids who play it
1% chance to get her back
it just still feels way too early for this area's snow season. and it's not supposed to be winter yet
fuck i should be sleeping
dab drago
bella i'm kidnapping you and forcing you to live in the temperate part of the country so you can suffer with the rest of us.
and its got mountains
if it's about me
again
this, a song of sons and daughters
college girl and i talk a bit more lately on snapchat
when you grew up in phoenix
hmmm
shall we watch again?
the bear thing killed me
once you know what verbs and prepositions are english is pretty ehhhhhhh
you’re fat
hey drago
how much do i have to pay you to use that?
well tbh i don't know either
does rarity work?
he got the wrong target.
hey ida would you punch me in the face if i started shipping you with rainy
i just go with w/e
you should use my node script to generate random usually-pronounceable character strings
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
i got two gay big sisters yay
one hangs out with me through games and one hangs out with me through vc
rainy's cute, i don't mind
a trans?
wait i was dating a trans
i dont wanna scroll whats up
so ask someone else
transgender*?
my mistake
you already have a stockpile
best friends would be ida, flubs, stormy, and breana
the answer is violence, dear rc
today a prof told me to make a medicine wheel
haha what a fuckin loser. being mentally stable sometimes. what a nerd
i love queer circles
civil war...you are talking to a friendship and war general
this is just kingdom of introverted ninnies: 1 vs. 100
but im like bi polar
i will individually break each and every one of your knuckles
that's uh, most of the reason i made it
ditto with ida and master
i forgot it
that was suppose to be an insult
i am genuinely happy that they see me like a younger brother
i like trolling hardcore here
that would be awesome
in that case do i have you guys' permission to change his name to "drago's toast"
got my hands on nova prime. what do you think of this moon themed fashion frame?
clyde
this is fun
and when the truth finally dawns
lowering the brightness by like 20% did it
i’ll take your silence as “yes”
here is a good joke
and regardless of your actual intelligence
if you asked an order of seconds earlier i wouldve signed up
if i have it i guess
where did you leave it for that to happen
it took me 10 seconds
just kinda...roll right out onto the floor
it happened before i lost it i went to class in the rain a bunch of times
mood
same, rainy
i think it's that they look at the game with the highest accumulated review score
kingdom of introverted ninnies: civil war
so maybe ones like kotaku's review of the game might be a factor as to how xeno 2 didn't get it instead of dragonquest.
good job
weird
i like beef
thanks i think i was happier not thinking about that
even if i wouldnt like them under any other circumstances
in which case its perfectly acceptable
would there be a challenge run for pokémon or/as
oh okay
same thing with my dad actually, you would think at first he's the nicest guy on the planet, but when you start to spend time with him, that's when things start to go downhill
was a much needed visit because it definitely distracted me from ym stress and stuff and i was feeling lonely as shit this week
that's only three hours are you okay
personal favorite kind is the one where it only gets funnier and funnier and you  can’t stop laughing, and you try to stop, making it funnier
it’s always good to get out for a while
i can’t math rn. it’s ok lol
me: gets up, sees that it's just after 9 am
never played either. both look ok to me
guys
yes flubs you can once i am done with it
that was the plan
though pls don't upload nsfw
also like what do they matter at all
yeet
there's your score
wait a minute why is dragonite on the side of the physics engine while im supporting the compiler
without the catalyst of math the leaps to get here would never be made, not before the heat death at any rate
flubs say something funny
i wanna pick a fight with this blade lord person
math bad
you should pick a fight with like a bumble bee or something
i wanna hear little dratini stories
ida wanna talk about pie or something
pogi was the leader
i was very close to one though
that was drat—
i can't forgive that
its just an example of when sending someone to prison is ok
i mean getting someone sent to prison ruins their life but if they murdered your parents it prolly justified
okay new plan let me dig around
insert obvious joke
so skyrim stream it is when i have time
but resetting every time you accidentally blow lydia off a mountain is annoying
gonna teach drago
why do you own all the dlc if you gave up ten seconds into the base game
i rounded down a bit
so you _did_ beat the tutorial bear
***hey dragonite did you hear your baby cousin won an award for marching band and was named ceo of earth, incorporated and has a girlfriend*** and by the way are you still like alive and stuff?
which is 100% acceptable by the way
(◕ ε ◕)
oh hey digging through my pics
but dont 100% it because the dunwall city trials are fucking horrible
so don't watch that
i did once
which are basically semiannual two-week black fridays
but....
ram might go down in price in 2019
all of it
no i definitely cant
that's like their whole shtick
ssds have gotten cheaper
fair enough
well if you're ever looking for more harddrive space i think i saw a 1tb ssd somewhere for like $130~140
every day is black friday with newegg
socks are the only garment humanity needs
did you hear someone got sued by nintendo for running a rom site>
youtube just shitted itself again
and ive been trying to get out of those for _decades_
squid arent you boneless though
hi angry i'm etinogard
black bear
ewwww
what show
"these people literally behave like my coworkers why would i want to watch it on tv"
i am angry
the first season sucks flubs
okay, his favorite food is the fingers of people who aren't as smart as they think they are
> math
and you love the fat guy
ida if you don't know what those are you probably dont want to look it up
tarantulas can be pets
problem is
wasps. oh wait, that's deadlier
do you have like an atom bomb i can borrow
drago's pet shop
crap i was in need of a filled soul gem
can someone kill me
with a mod
also creator studio bullshit is dumb
~~chicken breasts or real ones?~~ <:kappapride:379352530863521792>
i'm going to leave it that way until march
that should probably tell you something
actually i expected something worse
i got fired after
ping me if you set up a game
i could probably find a better one pretty easilyi though tbh
maybe when i have time wednesday
apparently it came back
didnt you only break up like three days ago
flubs we need an anthem after this
hey theres a statue of satan in a public square in kansas or something because of the confederation
drago you are greedy
worse.
i hate film
what is the film class about?
there’s a lot more info about it than o ever realized
oh damn i'm late i could've subbed in for drago on data structures
sounds like a fun one
without a controller
10,800 seconds until fantastic beasts
hey hey just because i wanted a tyrannosaurus as a pet at one poitn in my life means it's okay for _everyone_ to do taht
im not
false: it’s a 51% chance
only skyrim, fo4 and 76 so far run on creation
well i dont like having a beard and facial hair because it's more trouble than it's worth
i'm surprised so many people want warrior.
flubs
and even if its technically a different engine is it really *different*
but that one wasnt fromt he beginning i thought
so, uh, i wouldn't count on it anytime soon
you played mage
just play better 4head
i just dedicate a day to steam games
my recomendation would be awakening since its my favorite and its the one i started with
i'm honestly not that interested in slay the spire
i should work on that
i kind of wanna play 100% orange juice
i'm bored and kind of want to play some multiplayer....
good choice
i just woke up from an exhaustion nap, hi eyan
i'm down to  play
it's back, without blank cards
hey eyan, is it still possible we might see you play fire emblem?
they all left me
wheres my money then
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
yup but the plan this time was to fix it
blind luck
is reddit down?
that might take a week
password?
more
thats the 26
like he literally just said
linked in
no i just send death threats to it whenever it pms me about shit
true
charizard
i dont wanna get the thing tho
nonsense it's just soda poured on your hamburger so you dont have to eat them separately
we are all terrible. we are the hive.
round 2 rn
good lord squid
also did the rules change? i appear to be getting the cards that i play but are not selected returned to me
oh ida hates me today
the linkedin thing has a bunch of tags you can search by
i understand how it works now
it was the card i drew that turn
oh my god
god bless rngesus
about 33% chance of this being the last round
oh ida forgot to leave and rainy is typing
can you guys remove me on nov 23?
gn ida
well do it sooner rather than later, and by that i mean throw in the towel
all i have so far
wait
somebody
does this black card not even matter to y'all?
him and panda were both at 7/8
nobody cares about grammar
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
dammit
not a single expression
just a couple times every update
its great
in other news it turns out that telling a computer to figure out if two angles are close-ish to each other is _ass_
a bunch of scientists did a study once about why we sleep and after a ridiculous amount of time and grant money they concluded that it was "because we feel sleepy"
kugal are you a fan of modulo division
me: ok it's midnight i should go sleep
from scratch
he got paid for it too
once a _month?_
i think these stat questions are legit broken
well, ,i missed the last sat test for this year. so at this rate, i'm not going to be able to apply for college next year
i don't think we have one of those nearby in corn central
the only test i had to take was an accuplacer and bam that was good nuff
not dead
i havent played a pokemon game for years ):
darn, i wanna play games rn
so you pay to have a chance to pay to go to college
just dont take the tests
fair enough, rc.
societal pressure, higher-paying jobs, dream jobs/careers, etc.. take your pick
not higher paying jobs for college?
did your ds charger not reach the wall outlet or something
basically something that you could do in glsl and expect to work the way you intended it
“what killed the dinosaurs? the ice age!”
i can talk about generics and abstract data types all day dammit
i was gonna say something about doing what makes you happy no matter the cost but yeet
life
and liberty and the pursuit of happiness
the physics gnomes went on strike so gravity on venus is whatever it wants to be
yeah, who knows when that thing will get pissed and attack you
wait
that's most likely wrong
its not dependent on if its a planet or not
well we're not taking the atmosphere into consideration
different acceleration due to gravity
everything that exists that has mass has a force of gravity
so the moon isnt a planet because it doesnt orbit the sun, and pluto isnt a planet because its too small
why arent stars in solar systems with two stars planets
that’s what kids do: repeat the same shit a million times until someone yells at them
i'll just need a death star-sized bag that's all
first, they got to deal with the hundreds of thousands of people saying how terrible fallout 76 is
theres nothing on yt i want to watch. send help
hmmm
oh my god, ,the score for the ps4 version...
keep in mind i was like 8 lmao
it also doesnt matter because the atmosphere would dissolve your bones on venus before you hit the ground
big yes
i named my sister voldemort in my contacts and now i flinch every time she sends me a message
but you also didnt say all your suggestions would be as horrible as they are
alright so i have to make a decision today. do i just eat turkey cold cuts with instant gravy on top or do i make myself an entire turkey and eat the same thing for a month
ew rom hacks
one channel i've gotten into the last few days is mother's basement
three tiles
speaking of pokemon tho
i havent eaten at all today. this sucks.
aight well ive got 50 minutes so ill go start now
i'm bored

join vc
yes i know its terrible
he was a nice kid. gross though
how do you pat harshly
or that one
wack
that's hammer bros and bloopers
:boxthinking:
sure idk its name
whatever that means
i think the last one has a story behind it
just not happy
i almost did that once fortunately the imposter site was trash and looked nothing like what the actual site looked like and i figured it out pretty quickly
i'm definitely creating enemies with the let's go base atm
hi yes i’m a band man. can confirm woodwinds are the worst (like it just ends there at truth)
most of the time i am still asleep by the time it starts
~~now why would you accuse twitch grandpa of something like that?~~
speaking of bad man, some people in their patreon server might send stephen a shirt with “badman” on it. and mal is in on it 😛
i need to be at breakfast stream more
but i hate to completely toss away ss completely.  i think the best way to handle those comments is to just prove them wrong this time
nier automata is 50% off
makes sense to me.
you take away my modship so you can kick me off the team
lemme check
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
bella what i havent eaten breakfast since 2014
i don't want emotions antymore
not anymore
oh it's not grey
i opened skype the other day and my eyes threw up
when is later?
just find out how messy her house is and make yours messy to the same degree and she won't notice
i just remembered today is when we get stuffing.
~~so you’re a hoarder?~~
so all of the things that i'm probably going to be awful at
so prepare for reading
i ain’t doing good at understandin’ your language

i keep hearing word about it, is it worth watching?
i saw it already, dragonite
but he is not awake as the same time as me
bc like you gotta celebrate christmas right? but idfk how to do any of that shit besides the food
both
i dont mind turkey, its good, but i looked at what we're having and it looks 10 times better
stuffing indeed
stuffing? what is it?
kugal youve only eaten like 3 foods shut
its food and it is goddamn amazing
stuffing is life
then i remembered you're canadian
there we go
mr food expert
whats the word. pm me it
mr food expert
i should probably drag my right hand man here for protection
master
help i want more pie
alright lets make this easy for you then
he still has an alt somewhere around here that he mentioned earlier
do i want to know?
thats a nice way to put it majestic haha
fourth of july is only american in name
fair point.
happy capitalism.day
we shouldnt have months and just have 365.241 days every year
but even so
that wont work out
just hit the middle ground
rainy i'm going to force you to re-watch the movie over and over until you change your mind
functional 9/10
well he doesn't seem to mind
duck
indeed. welcome.
what's it on?
the last lesson was on hypothesis testing between two samples, both independent and paried
your course was pretty damn fast. we're only gonna get to integrals this monday
but i couldn't do it last night because mystatlab was under maintenance
just break webassign until he gives up using it
hey were always blue for me
that’s some dark stuff lol
your face is infinity
yeah what i said is infinity but in math form
there will be a good amount of limit questions
like master said: everything is derivatives
one of my wisdom teeth just came in and i dont mind it
which is more differentiation lmao
ive started getting fancy with how i eat the same 3 foods
how much mass in kilograms remains in your leftovers?
oh definitely
and be stuck with my great-aunt?
you know what's the absolute 100% best feeling in the world
i made libre office pissed at me with a 3gb ram sheet
either that or ill go into server settings when nobody's looking and add a greener nu role or whatever it's called
thanks
that's actually pretty rare
pretty much all of the reviews on all of the final fantasy games on steam say one of two things
that was me the entirety of bio a few years ago
do it for the tense pre-presentation college students
some professors make you memorize them and suffer
annotations were the big boxes?
youre right they did it because it doesnt work on the devices that account for more than half of all playbacks, _and_ most of the others don't use them
annotations were ass
in essence, today is a mess?
just check the comments of the wooly world videos
welp, guess emile's comment sections now will be flooded with chuggaaconroy cultists. not sure how i feel about that
i think it's just average
curse mobile and making it hard to show that
also i got a confirmation email saying im enrolled in calc ii, so thats neato. now i just gotta take my calc i final and kick butt and do my best and then i'll be on the road to more math lol
how the heck is 100 average
no one knows why
as far as i can tell
im saying some would if 0 was the average
cause that's hilarious
i definitely do because im an idiot but for fucks sake just move the scale to a better place
but does a 0 baseline not make more sense than a 100 baseline
its stupid where it is. keep everything the same, just move everyones iq down by 100
intelligence quotient
so it's impossible to get negative numbers
bollocks im not green anymore
it makes me happy that two-year-old me is on average smarter than now-me
well, at a certain point it starts to decrease
the system was proposed by a psychologist
do you mean _your_ arms dont functionas swords
gotta make an email that wont be taken but will be looked at without being assumed to be spam
making throwaway emails is hard
ok cool
wow. ive never applied to schools before and it’s kinda very scary
nothin much whats up with you
not trying to one up the suffering contest
alright so i finally came back to my third run on emerald
i mean that'd be kinda cool now would it
also no greninja & charizard this time
i’ve used all of those except for delphox
delphox is the one with a wand or something right?
i was also so tempted to make azumarill a temporary team member yet again and choose crawdaunt instead
even then i haven’t played either in a really long time
they use it?
im thankful for flubs
yeah, i still think the sequels in gen 5 are better than the originals
the general opinion in the pokémon fan base that i strongly disagree with is that gen 5 is the best and gen 4 is the worst
the final boss was better
ehh, i either loved or hated the changes (or lack of change)
if did not go well.
but that doesn't mean i will like it as a final boss
this is almost the exact same fight as we had recently
some people were annoyed with the changes to lusamine also
~~i think you mean climax boss~~
i thought the story in sun and moon was better than black and white. i just can’t be with everyone calling that the best story
and i haven’t bought a pokémon game in years
also it was already confirmed that the 8th gen games will have a different engine to let's go and that they will be the best looking games in the series so far
and with the let’s go games selling 3 million copies fast, i think it’s safe to say we will be seeing more let’s go games
i am convinced that they just look sun and moons engine and made let's go in hd
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i don’t really like saying communities are toxic, because every single one has its terrible fans, but yeah, some parts of the pokémon fandom are awful
let’s go looked more like x&y in hd to me
anything popular, labelled toxic. even when it's a relatively great community
irrelevent
you have to play a game to give a score
also to be fair
the most toxic and moronic nintendo sub community
sorry if my phrasing was bad
-rideable pokemon
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
-following pokemon
btw were the motion controls a turn off for you also squid
i made a whole team of 6 follow you around once that was a glorious mess
because he's like perpetually drunk and that would explain a lot
brb getting food
ted talk? this doesn't really feel like one of those
essentially, greeks are cooler
greek seems to have stuck the most, but it certainly spread tech progress across the isolated nations a solid amount
are you comparing roman nanotechnology to bird doo
truly too ahead of their time
we can map out the entire chicken genome, put it onto a computer, then broadcast that via wifi which is really radio which is really electromagnetic radiation. thus you can radio people chicken shit
honestly the last half hour of talk in here is what enhasa should be like
algettu has been revitalized
darn
i wonder if youtube api allows you to get a list of discord users from those that join a channel
oh well maybe we just havent advanced far enough as a society to make use of inte or polo
i was curious to see if my calculator could do large sums so i inputted an infinite sum only to 100000 terms and it the calculator took 20 minutes to evaluate the sum
here let me get the sum
master you do it for me im tired
probably
is that not what you entered
lucius appuleius saturninus, a tribune, passes a law to redistribute land to military veterans. the law requires that all senators swear to abide by it. quintus caecilus metellus numidicus refuses and is exiled. he goes to rhodes to study philosophy.
even if ya did then it still shouldnt be that high of a number lol
i dont have a good word for it but its too round i guess
i need a nice corner couch to work on
soul color changes proportionally with numbers of unsolved murders
hahaaaaahhh
fun prank
this is about the purity test, isn't it?
and what is the score of 15 from? the roman thing?
you *must* know what that is
thats a new low for you
it takes being the most horrible to have that moniker
i've got to work morning concessions tomorrow. because we need basketball games in like 9 in the fucking morning, an elementary game at that
done
didn't help also that it took forever to get the nature and ability i wanted for my azurill also which needed to be happy to evolve, so that was fun with all of that walking xp
is it me drago?
like why do i need to justify everything with this guy lmao
radio silence speaks volumes
you can say it
rainy i hate to say this
only after accepting your low lewdness stat can you grow it
i prefer not being arrested
let's try and get eyan in, it's friday
(ssh, not here, rainy)
(maybe later)
you underestimate how dumb i am
though asthma makes nerds, not nerds get asthma
i have one semester's experience with uni compsci
(◡‿◡✿)
that’s how i am right now
squid stop hating things
shut up it's owls
i'm a month and a half into this run and it's been exceptionally smooth
nobody yet
you should use me as your meat shield because i'm probably the skinniest person ever
is it a coincidence that deci just came online or are you two planning on league?
as soon as i get a chance
hooray time for another round of me putting off contacting any of you until sunday afternoon when everyone's packing up
also buh bye ida
i look wonderfully grumpy, thank you
you think that's bad? i'm just gonna drive 24 hours and kick in their room door
i’m already argonian
how do you say "cheese" in dovahzul
super nerd army
also i can also confirm that the friends suck ass in this game
i hope so
what the crap twitch
who remembers when memes had effort put into them
also what happened to not worrying about details and "fuck it just do it" in regards to youtube?
it still takes some details ya ninny
what else was there
no its just old fashioned
perfect
dont have time to wonder into the  endless vastness of space
romans didnt know it existed lol
iv unit, extra large, liquid crystal display, direct message
alll valid abbreviations in modern language
ive counted to 4 in binary on my fingers a few times
also doesnt matter if you use thumb or pinky as 2^0
weird til "our" and "your" are only off by one letter
something something noose nice
most video game characters do
good for compression i guess
is it gilgamesh?
here's a gilgamesh one.
my mom would break physics
what happens if it gets full
was recording something today and something catastrophic almost happened
~~name a dratini after me~~
yeah but it's about eleven characters too long
greekid
hubble, galileo, brahe, kepler, etc
think about it dragonite, going to go eat, get back to me later when i stream
all of them, but sceptile probably won't get much use
it's very bad
i had to do one of those stall battles against his milotic with my walrein
does that bot help with music theory and the resolution of v7 chords?
we're live by the way
i wish
tomorrow is black friday so i gotta go to best buy
i can but im not gonna do that quite yet,
that aloix guy is a fucking loser
til boxbox watches chugga

is that going on right now?
the teacher is talking about fishing with a guy who isn't in the class
very mooooving
oh human
first come, first serve.  makes sense for this sort of thing.
i don't have much left and i'm going completely from memory because i'm at work
just my shorthand "draco" would suffice.  i know it's not fitting for a metagross, but it's less complicated that way.
but they won't get much use so i was thinking of giving them to my not so active but big time past donators
not really a "story" per se, but you were the first person i watch on youtube ever and for the first few months, the only person i watched.
well you don't actively make videos right now. 😜
now that's a good story.  😛
i can only beat most of them on normal.  i have beaten a few extra stages and hard runs on the easier games though
i found your stream randomly, you were doing solo queue for league and wearing your teemo had.
i'm sort of in a similar position, only with college instead of work.
i feel lonely, sad, and bitter, despite being surrounded my a lot of awesome people.
i'd be lying if i said i didn't have a lot of fears about it though
i'm worried that nobody will care, the world has changed around me quite a bit, but from a youtube perspective, i'm still the same old derpy kid who just wants to screw around with videos
i appreciate that.  right now, i think support is all i need
it seems like a huge liability, lol
rainy, you are one of the most important people in my life
i am here
i couldn't sleep right now anyways
yeah eyan, i'll cover for you, i'm off, go grab a nap
i avoid it like the plague
i will admit though, i'm surprised how chatting with you guys isn't actually hurting my productivity that much
yup, i do it all the time in the kitchen, knife in one hand, phone in the other
yo eyan, ping me wherever if you want, i'm get a tiny bit more sleep
i'm usually 8-4 if i'm in the front, or 6-3/4ish if i'm in the kitchen
plenty of sleep time
that sounds dreadful
the end
somebody
hey nerds
tis a good story
bella!
no thanks
i couldn't live somewhere where 50 was considered freezing cold
50 sounds good when you’re stuck in the 30s all winter
what’s the hottest it gets around there?
i'd rather move north if i had to go anywhere
i said special twice
it sounds lewd
wow, choosing that over me, i see how it is
it's been a rough week.  >_<
definitely
just human
oh god, that's terrible
nobody should want to be reincarnated as me
it's at least good that you're venting, though
so that was neat
besides, i'm not stupid, i'll be in a call with friends to watch over me.
oh you’re working right now? didn’t know that
eyan, outta curiosity, do you see a therapist?
so, to answer the question, some days it can be my entire shift, other days, not as much.  i'm "accounts payable" though so my job is pretty much just to pay bills
that’s special
i have a bad habit of finding an excuse to not see one
much cheaper solution
now tell me a story
i’ll be watching the stream after i finish watching raw
understood
learn to drive
how long does that take? like, does that take your whole shift or just most of it?
i've been able to talk to my mom about my issues
thanks guys
no it's called fun mode
i can’t imagine one side of the county to another
since she knew exactly what i was going through
holy crap it's brad
working out does good things, therapy wise
shouldn’t be too bad
so now i take the bus
i can do more, i just learned that once i got to about 3 hours, i started not liking it anymore
i know it's not the brad i know, lol
this may not be the brad you know
driving is fun for a while
why not fly if you have to drive 7 hours?
f
try a 9 hour plane ride
i usually stop at a denny's in middle of nowhere wyoming
oh no eyan is dead
i'm a capitalist at heart
and i'm sure she wouldn't mind paying interest anyways
wow, way to assume and talk about me like i'm not here
i mean
i try my best
you aren't wrong
you bastard
gift horses? are you planning on sending eyan a horse for christmas? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
but "no futher punishment" is not a complete sentence
you’re not a compl
it’s stupid
i’m not allowed to do anything around here
ill be back in about half an hour if i get through volunteer duty fast
i'm a grinch, who needs santa hats
good job (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
also
yeah
i demand that somebody tell me a story
kinky
i demand the story of ragnar the red stop
i want an original story
once upon a time, a squid had to get ready for work. the end
there once was a hero named ragnar the red
guys, i think i just hit the lottery
too many scales for me
impressive
ok here's a story i'm recycling right now and the teacher decided to take a shortcut through the blizzard to go grab bags for recycling
try setting it on fire
also nice unintentional double entendre
i watch them for the same reason you watch gross surgery videos. you know its gonna suck to watch but you just cant look away
that's the maids job
i thought at least jake would be in it
well they arent that popular and have caused a lot of problems for youtube
jake was in it; at least the last couple of episodes
also bella, not a kitten
yo fuck thats a good point
he wanted to come with us
she is a cat
high five
the cat _is_ the maid
didnt she fucking murder subaru though eyan
and my body
like i know it was a misunderstanding but she still murdered him pretty hard
i'll pay for all of your needed maid expenses
beacon of feminism as i am, i've always wanted to be a maid
i could be like the butler who always falls asleep and plays ds games on the job or something
i like maids
i can cook and clean like a goddess
we are strong independent women
and how tall is ida?  lol
of course to keep it in proportion youd have to remove the forearms and the middle of the torso
so maybe rem is more apt
i feel like i really want to know what some of you look like
yeah but i could’ve been like... 5’10
just means you can attack the abdomen easier
i think one of them is nearly 7 feet
my cousins have giants for parents so they’re all tall and it’s annoying
now we need a disappointed head butler. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
he's the butler
hey 9k
yeah, but i'm sure he would prefer dark lord of the sith and hand of the emperor
rainy had a soul? this is news to me
cats
not anymore
you ca be the daedric prince of cats
indeed
that's molag bal's domain
i don't really know what i want
love made with  pizza sounds mediocre at best
nice
that's an odd form of precipitation
well i'm pretty tight with azura, and she knows all bout that void shit
i get the feeling you secretly want to actually be my maid, lol
just roll with it
hey you're  cute hon
public class lower{
eyan;
i never said i disliked ass, just i'm more of a boobs guy, lol
good job
i would do that shit seconds before it's due
did ya guys see youtube rewind 2018 came out today lol
later, eyan.
\*and he was never heard from again\*
hay thats a plus
i used to watch his stuff as well back in the day.
would i be bombarded by people’s surprise if i said i have never heard it before
<:kappaclaus:520412032042926080> and <:kingofchristmas:520412492787089408> are here for the holidays
how is red dead 2's music and art better than god of war's?
just dont watch shit you dont like, and if you do want to watch it for whatever fucking reason, dont make it our problem
guys it dawns on me that maybe eating a large amount of coffee ice cream just before midnight might not have been the best idea i ever had
and proud of it
so i’m not allowed to not like something popular? don’t act like you never go through it
i just want you all to know i went to bed at 6 so i could wake up at 1 am and play smash until work at 4:30 am
it could be quite terrible so don't be too excited.  😛
but that's being human imo
~~if it makes you feel better, i would probably be worse~~
current game plan for salvation of the project is making 3d models then getting the angle just right to have them align with an existing stock photo of a person using a product
his channel was my childhood
here, anyway
we'll see, the theme of right now is "screw it, just do it"
it's people like you who stop by and remind me that i'm still remembered for what i accomplished so long ago
and sometimes it makes threats
i've certainly gotten salty because of popularity for things i didn't care about.  it's not really a logical train of thought though, that much i will admit.  dragonite is right, why drain energy into caring about what's popular
you got two parts in and then stopped.
emile goes on a noa rant for two minutes and fifteen seconds
this is important
ooof, drinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow.  how could i forget the golden rule
gday m8
\:thinking\:
not sure how to feel about that
i think reality is slapping me over the face again
probably like, the end of my yt career level video combined with early yt career level editing
that didn't work
no more than normal at least
edit yourself
not a half bad idea
i wish i could edit myself
for somebody to fill the void of emptiness in my life
ah, the best kind of reward
oh nice
but i legit thought i failed my calculus i midterm but got 97%
the college classes usually start later than my highschool semester but they also end earlier too
i fucked up the curve several times in one of my entry level finance classes
friggin hell yea man
thats not too shabby
otherwise i would have failed it miserably, lol
except for that one semesters in freshman year in highschool
oras starting now <:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>
gotta eat breakfast, bbl
to me i saw 'breakfast' and it's fairly early where i am so i was like "yea makes sense" in my head lul
this stream made a bunch of people join
i wonder what would happen if i went around introducing myself as "mr spam"
i said skarmory, not skarm jesus christ
i’m back from work. eyan still streaming?
hola y'all
calculated that back in june
oh i've come to terms with this revelation a loooooooong time ago pal
there is no reasonable hour
did you record a black screen again eyan
it's beginning of the month so we get a lot of monthly bills around this time so i've been building up for the last few days to a day of just sitting around posting them
why do anything simple when you can overcomplicate it
—dragonite family motto
i remember
congrats
welcome
but i've got an ass that you need to install a mod for
why does it mention that you have the everyone role
i feel like most people have that one
i’ll try it first, but thank you
if you send me the original pic i can do this with a better resolutino
you mean the finger lakes? because those exist <:kappa:374346980136058893>
engrossing
specifically the middle one
50 mins
what _does_ this coast hve
darn it squid
is it really
yes! thank you kugal i thought i was the only one
dang it it’s for the holiday spirit guys
when i got promoted
squid everyone knows governments work best when theres two leaders with opposing views who dont want the other one to win
there’s like 3
it was a 100 question ap chem test
lmao
i mean think about it. being a great runner but your name not being recognizable makes it easy to hunt people for sport but not get recognized while people snatching
fair point
so how are all the non-sick people doing?
and if you get spotted what are they gonna say? "5'7" white guy in his late 20s with an average build" like theyre gonna be able to find you out based on that
man im really out of touch?
whats counts as being dead on the inside?
crustaceans can't play video games silly
sounds fun, but i don't think that story even has an ending
wow dragonite
then if your local recording doesnt have sound you can pull down the video from twitch, extract the track with just the game audio, and use that
soon™
welcome to the show
he learns from the best
that’s west coast
yeah, no kidding
i mean, i was the one who came up with the term gigglebutt, lol
wow rude
but he gives out free hugs sometimes
spreadsheets actually require energy right now for me.  v_v
i had to bother a company twice for a model, got it with half the dimensions missing, did pixel measurements for the rest, made the 3d model and now i need to orient it and throw it back into a stock photo using the product plus our accessory
i need more confidence, and maybe a map
i actually have an irl friend now, it's kinda weird
thanks
otherwise i'm just really tall and awkward
i couldn't tell you a single thing about pretty much any presentation i ever watched
i dunno, i'm in a weird state right now
to fix it.
i could flip my loneliness to  smothered by far more attention that i could ever desire, lol
honestly, if i could have touhou powers of some sort, i probably would just be content being my own little god
imagine the chaos that perfect possession would case in the world.
i appreciate the company though
on the other hand
very true.
how dare they only charge us 6% tax
new show: eyan 24/7
i'm also going to have learn to trust people again, lol.  i'm way too stubborn with wanting to do everything myself
exactly
fair enough.  😛
eyan we already have the plans, you have only to tell me to <:doit:334014889137930240>
what do i look like, a genius?
no worries.
have fun
and scanned
not really, it missed a page
i could also easily assist in that department
but if i start doing the weekly series, it could come into play
gday mate
what's new in your world?
how'd ya do?
next final after this is my calculus final
noice
got some friends that are really good at it
thankfully we did have to produce it. there would be no way
sheesh.
film was fun,
thankfully i stopped before i got to that level but the production of things is just overwhelming looking
is it a euphemism for fart or something idk butts dont usually giggle
people also complained that it took too long to cover a game, which, i mean, that could be arguably a fair critism
all hail bob ross
hopefully being a little older and wiser will make it easier this go round if i succeed again
you did this to yourself
crystal meth
it's true, constantly
with how the building is?
that isn't illegal either
heyah
did you know it's possible to physically move a solar system, one day the human race may say "we do it because we can" and move the sun
jello
maybe it's a sign lol
moving the solar system how far? it's kinda already in motion
just a spoiler in general
no way
lower that to 5 too
guess who just got smash
compooter benig dumb ill do it in a minute
feels like its been 12/10 forever
the last thing is to write  my 3 minute speech about it
i should just drop bot.js in the master branch of the repository and let everyone else figure out why it's there
aaaaaaaaand this discord server is now at the top of my servers
yeah anyway homework bye
it's calculus lol
oh, it's mee6
yay thank you
don't worry flubs
medz plus more meds sounds great
yeah but is it quick and painless or is it slowly stop being able to breathe until all my muscles stop working and i lie there immobile as my brain stops
cuz id rather the first tbh
well, glas to know the tanuki leaf is called the super leaf in ultimate
well that is bullshit
mesothelioma has become a meme now
and i mean theres always the chance i get hit by a bus or burned at the stake for witchcraft or something
i mean i dont really even get it all i know is im dying but it also doesnt hurt so who cares
it's just on netflix
just as an fyi
just like seven deadly sins
oh i wasnt there today but im stuck_in_a_box_
if the default healing spell costs 1 magic per second, how many points of magic do you spend after casting it continuously for 3.5 seconds
it's be beautiful
i have work tomorrow but it still isnt late
also i lowered the shanty odds
nah t posing in front of a freight train
and theres gotta be a maximum age for most people right? probably before you turn 12 if i had to guess
fun story my friend almost died by booking it into a tree and breaking his nose and forehead. there was blood everywhere and that is when i discovered that death is a thing
also here's a memefrom 2011
so i would say that's about right
i mean my phone was a cheap 300 dollar samsung
i was i cant do math in 2011

good job
oh you meant like...ohh
oi, try singing on those choir stands for 20 to 30 minutes with no lumbar support
the programming community should band together to destroy the evil
attempt mage
ive seen it. its pretty good
watching my class trying to put everyone's code together is excruciating
thanks buddy
you know i realize i could log in on the school computer and not have to type on my phone
theres a non purpose?
how many hours do you think i have on ultimate <:gwsetmyxpeepoevil:405337570952740864>
if youre not playing it now the answer is "not enough"
on purpose?
oh good
and an sd card
i have put quite a few other games on the  sd card, tho
i got a 128 gb sd card for this game
i have like a 4 gb card for my 3ds
i would have like that
~~but it can be better~~
you’d still get the best thing and use those buttons for others anyway
that it is
ggez
wait crap when did it become 11 pm
how many
the rewind has over 9.9 million dislikes
help
i just did it
hooray for interpreted languages not making sure your variables are spelled right at compile time, because there is no compile time
then do the best sneaky cosplay there ever was!
whatever happens happens i guess lol
every day is christmas
morning? my day is mostly done
how does one get a 100% in english
you should totally talk to us
it's funny because he's pink nu
one of my friends is like barely hanging onto straight a's
honestly, not everybody should.  i've quickly learned that anybody can make a decent living even if they aren't smart.
he'll be fine then.  meanwhile, i'm sitting here thinking that i didn't have a job until 23 if you don't count youtube
i would consider it a job because you are/were making an income at one point which in my book sounds like what a job does lol
i'm tirrrrrred
my appetite has hit the gutter though.  i've lost 5 pounds in the past week and a half.  i'm okay with that though, i was slowly adding weight over the past year and i'm happy to shed some of it off.
falling asleep is an issue for me but so is waking up
also, yeah kugal, i guess it was technically a job, in fact a damn good one, but i feel like it did nothing for me in terms of developing skills i need for the normal workforce so now i'm playing catchup
depression's a big dumb fuck
thats an interesting way to look at it, i havent thought of that
and also because i don't even know what kind of person i like
i value other perspectives.
and i don't want to be foolish and jump into something that's doomed to fail just because i feel lonely.
because i still feel like i acted wrongly, even if i just didn't have the right information to act
but i think when i got with collette, the mistake there was just not really thinking about what i needed out of a relationship
i like how you evaluate the consequences of waiting and not waiting, becuase that could be the very difference in making a final decision
as long as i like them for them im happy
i also know what i like
yea i've always been in the mindset of it's better to wait, any attempt to wait to become older to fully commit in a relationship take that opportunity
how dare the human race evolve in a way that promotes reproduction and the survival of the species.
or just is too screwy for my tastes.
4 hours away was tolerable, but that is definitely my limit moving forward.
im gonna brb, i should get ready to leave here for the bloody final
ah yes, that's kinda important
nah, i really am just looking to talk to people
if only walkthroughs for relationships existed, and ones that actually eorked amirite <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i think that’s all we can do
life requires and ungodly anount of patience
if you even know what your vision is
i don't have it down to a science, but as the years pass, i get better and better at knowing myself
honestly wouldn’t know, that’s highly dependent on the person
woah that's an essay to catch up on
which brings me back to, where's my damn life cheat codes at
except the dragonborn is life and you're alduin
she's definitely too good for me and she knows it
i mean, i'm honestly not opposed to mixing things up
if you don't start i'm gonna scan out every page of the drivers ed book i have somewhere and randomly send you pages
may have to
10k subs?
but for the record, i don’t think i’m too good for anyone. quite the opposite
im back
yeah, arrogance
i mean, in all actuality, i have some confidence when i'm not depressed as hell
that would burn through healthy mental states like a forest fire through california
i can't have too much summer and spring though, allergies are just too rough on me.  fall and winter offer me that reprieve
not the most appropriate timing there
sadly though i couldn’t live in any other state. california has pretty much got all that i need
i think so. it’s there enough for me to remember
or something like that
i prefer to look out upon the world and see death and desolation
and i'd say i'm not exactly a road rager, but bad driving is probably my biggest pet peeve
there’s always full streets of parked cars here
and then i will get one
and probably die
that was pretty nice
there is dragons, just, imaginary, lol
so is life
death is highly overrated
eyan, i’m sure you have a better chance than me in my area 😛
its ok dragonite
dragonite, that wasn’t a dream. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
ew...
on the topic of warm temperatures
nothing is nicer than weather in the comfortable 50s on a nice autumn day
147 is borderline death are you mad
i don't know you well bella, but you seem like a good person.  i don't think the arrogance that rainy is displaying is appropriate, but i think you can feel good about yourself
well, you are his creator
ida your country is already skyrim
sadly, i always have a nagging feeling to be productive so it feels like a waste of time
it feels the most fleshed out and most like home
and the endless power struggles
wasnt that riverwood though
is there a good mod that lets you be a bard?
any female* single
i never used one but i know there was one bard mod that was pretty popular
no *thoughtcrime* is death
and usually anything that popular was at least good if it was what you were looking for
huh, darn i would've been good for music lol
exactly
welcome!
i'll have you know
haha good one master
that it is, thanks flubs
i'm surprised you didn't question how full of shit i am right now, lol
he now has nail polish
worst bot 0/10
what master said
either way pings will fly when it starts
oh crap then i'll be sleeping, oh well
wow how specific
no reverse cards not uno cards
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
hey i have a life
i have the sudden urge to punch something <:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
well, i have just reached my state of boredom that i go through every year before christmas; all i can think about is the new games i will play afterwards and nothing i have now can keep me entertained
no happiness allowed
your small people are so hard to understand
let people ruin their lives in peace
i actually can't wait for the return.
why you cant go to college and also be successful? i mean you can but i dont see why youd put yourself at a four year, hundred thousand dollar disadvantage
yea..
nice
master that is how you remove yourself from the gene pool
i cant get text to zoom in in my video editor even though ive specifically selected the option designated to do so, is this some weird windows shenanigans
but also, same. sadly
~~who?~~
really, i thought that was michael scott in a costume
i have literally gotten four mesa chassis in a row.
i'm michael stevens
between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes
dont it though i mean if you got money you can get one of those cool hand freezing anti-death machines
you get that a, wouldn't want anyone getting d around here
screw you
maybe i removed it when i fixed the thing with the censor list not working
<:gwqlabsthonkery:398950779769061376>
~~80 is the best~~
yeah the censor list doesnt work
and ive heard good things about those pocket monster games
flubs you're a wonderful person who's going to live a long and happy life
holy shit
i feel like you do
text or call your grandma
huh.
oh, who am i kidding, of course you don’t
to obad im already 2200 messages behind for that
given that outoftouchtube is owned by google
now the only thing i send outbound email for is calling my sister dumb names
how were you not already using gmail
you too huh?  😛
afterward it goes back to normal style
the end product is the same and it lowers costs
cows are food
cows that exercise taste better btw
or at least doesnt have the time for it
well you can ask him about it when hes available and brew your thoughts together until then
you want to keep talking about this?
mcdonalds doesnt really care if their meat tastes a little worse
what'd i miss
it should probably care if the meat gets contaminated and they have to recall and check large samples for disease
who decides that's a good idea though sharing blood is the source of like half the non-malaria diseases in the history of forever
is all cow meat cooked well enough to be sterile?
c stick one
the thing only became a major issue in 1986 so if we take this as a sign that we can start doing questionable thigns again the problem has the potential to relapse
but probably no because theres no way this is gonna become a problem in my lifetime
do i want to go in for my last final or just sleep
maybe if i tell my teacher i came down with a case of death he'll let me re-take it at a normal hour
what the hell
also surprisingly doing ok despite getting up before 4:30 today
actually it doesnt but thats still an awful lot
how low do you want price
brad is this what you do for fun
mood.
then it'd kill me though
well i know that 8.2/40 is around 20% prolly closer to 21% so you couldntve done 5 times better but definitely did more than 4.75
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
dragonite why does a highway need to own islands?
3:30-9:30
thank you
want the audiobook?
i think my transcripts get updated tomorrow
you’re definitely thinking about it a lot then
0.0 stephen is doing a weird thing with the ending song atm on stream
there
good job kugals
i cant engrish despite passing engrish final
you get
thanks pal
my final english grade is 98.2% lol
the midterm was like 90% multiple choice with just one short response  it should have been graded by the computer
how many people are in your class?
quesadilla burgers are great
same honestly
thanks <:pogchamp:305560024443518986>
my weapon is bad memes
i think it's the steel typing
hey remember in like fourth and fifth grade when we'd get like five things for homework and the teacher would have all of it graded by like the next morning
it turned a samsung galaxy into a grenade.
and whatever other fucking shit that counts as a character
skarm is god
he did it
the newer thief from 2016 or whatever is garbage dont play it
i feel a growing sense of dread
i think theres one in the house in solitude that starts the whole thing
those books have an interesting property to them in regards to damned souls, bella
brb gonna go talk to her
tmw your robot has friends and you don't
why madagascar?
oh right
lol if you want to
hmm it's 10:30 and ive gotten nothing done i brb
boobs are more fucking sensitive than me the morning after an alcohol bender
that's ok
i guess that may be the benefit of college
just turn it into a snowflake with editing magic
master these are your people or something
i wasnt on the ssformus
which equally is not a benefit at all
dragonite42 :::)))))
oooooooo
as in my major?
i'm the vb2 dragonite
doubt anyone remembers blackrayquaza except the few that knew
it's a little rough but it's not like i'm doing anything else with my pitiful existence so may as well.
just gotta use a bit of algebra slight of hand and u substitution and bam its super doable
no matter how well i do on the final in one of my classes my grade will go down
the answer is why.
i'm close to a level up so that's mainly why i'm here lol
do i continue skyrim even though i’ve played a lot today o
is that wrong
at my school it was a 65 or below was failing and you only could go on to the next class in a series if you got at least a 73
this is a problem
it would seem that way
i'm down to my last brain, if that one explodes then, well i'm shutting down until my next brain get's fixed
this shit needs the right setup
lots of new people
a reder red lol
but mr stabby is a snowman
yeah
let's burn it
same thing
you said yeah first which makes the no invalid
hey, i can only afford 7 brains alright
tomorrow can't be easter because easter falls on a sunday
then i'll throw a triangle
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
kinda lame, i wanted the car alarm to go off
yeah i thought skull kid would be one of the newcomers
both
i wouldn't be angry obviously, just don't care
everyone else that has a chance is just i don't care really
dovahkiin, doomguy (just for the music), crono (watched eyan lp his game so many times), crash (i played 1 game being nitro kart), 8th gen pokemon
same, that's really why i don't feel the need to buy any dlc
and it was
yeah square is really stingy
i'm more inclined to play ff6 than 7
watch as the dlc pack for crono only has 1 song in it if he's a character lol
yeah i really don't understand why square is being so stingy with their ip
yeah and still only 2 songs
also i think geno might be dead now
i'd love to see banjo in the game, but i'm not holding hope for it even with microsoft being all for the idea
and universal is owned by comcast iirc which is a competitor to disney
i really don't know who else they could choose
so yeah <:coerip:508432005038342174> that character
and well
exactly, what i said
there's also the fact that they would not add an echo unless it's a two-for-one deal, and each will give us only one fighter
i'd say it was that he was announced as the first dlc of the fighter packs, even at such a big event no less
dovahkiin or doomguy
though metal gear rising would make for a better point of reference because platinum games
for some reason, the 21st always had weird sentimental value to me for absolutely no real reason but i forgot about it this year
one day i’ll find my birthday twin
it makes sense actually. i think i’m the same way, but i had an earlier birthday than i was supposed to but i don’t know the date of that
paving your own path is the dream
*plays the “i hate people” song from spongebob* this should be my theme song
as it turns out, i'm going to be spending most of today applying for my first ever job.
lets not
you can catapult yourself ahead a lot faster if you get a good one
everyone did
i have pirouettes which are a close 2nd
or at least well enough to enjoy venting his frustrations on fictional characters by brutally murdering them?
you tell me, you're the one who answered the question
either way, they need to work as well to get their pay
an ethically questionable career
it honestly annoys me even as someone who has never played their games
must be an important job just sitting in one place
i see that, it's okay though, i won't ignore your ass
i imagine that line will now go in the bot also, lol
oh joy, apps are always unnescessarily long
nice
nice ^w^
nice
i'm not even going to ask questions in risk of getting snapped to dust
e!google ask reddit hangover tips
but still, i just didnt get any joy from it.
r34lol is great but has become infested with kda
i think it's supposed to be a glass of water per drink
hai friends ^w^
they'll get over it
most people forgot about the meteos situation within two weeks, so it kinda is
i frequently forget rall exists
k pop.
ohh....
i dont understand, why are there people that find underage anime girls attractive?
i mean, i'm not fine, but i'll be fine, i think
do you exercise regularly?
i better, lol
i think i have an unhealthy obsession with this overcoat
cuz even small things like going for a run can help combat feeling depressed and down,
neither am i
i’ve had three coffees this week. am i a stereotypical adult yet
close enough
and i have a soda machine in our lunch room but i've been cutting back
i also forgot where my box was so i lost my debit card as well
and that's it
anyways food is here peace
actually, good
nice
i don't even know what that is so i'm good
what is wrong with me
it's an internship position.
it's a floating island how hard can it me
tis that cold time of the year
today's was about cats
id say theres the effective solution of making all claimed content private but theres too many alternative uploads available
ahhh
eh, true
that would be somethin' else
why didnt you just attend them when they were live
greetings, animal\_man\_.

i do want to do that
what are the main memes of 2018
oh that
honestly yeah
you got that pretty spot on
otherwise
i'm not eating there
i've never been so complimented and intrigued at once
i'm just depression drinking to ignore the fact i'm spending christmas entirely alone
in statistics you always round to the even number
i don't have time i just make it by putting off things that are actually important
cool
but cool
get fallout 4
based on the context, you
cool
what are we fucking?
i was distracted
kings orders
<:ironic:307345212328509442>
the rest being days off from work, partying with your friends, and watching gladiatorial events
magfest is a 3.5 day event so on any given day there's a 1% chance that i'll be at magfest
merry christmas eve, ya nerds
of course you did
music and gaming festival
have fun, don't break anything
oh i have some time rn, time to scan out the driving rules book and start bothering bella with that
*me starts harmonizing* who lives who dies who tells your story
it's the main day in some countries
ironically missed the ping because i was playing sims 3
all driving speeds will be in m/s
i like how the modern internet just lets you google strings of six words and instantly find out who said them
nice
yummy
it's a sheogorath quote
i'm pretty sure we lose like four one-millionths of a second per year or something
its the one people want the most of
so today i was playing my drums, with my phone bluetooth connected to my headphones and then when i decided to stop playing i dropped the phone onto a drum, and it landed onto one of th tension rods in the worst possible way ever
the clone wars
that is, if you play the drums
come to think of it, i actually need to get a phone at some point in the near future
that’s the exact lyrics where i thought it’d go bad, actually
like one day the charger port just decided to lose any and all grip
present spoiler
well you can be alive on the outside and dead on the inside

mine may have a second one, but with the only angle i'm viewing it from, it'd be impossible to see
i'm on data
it's always an experience
do we have ninja turtles?
merry christmas, nerds.

the twelve days of christmas?
ginormigantuan difference
id join but im calling my friend
i thought mine was missing a few vowels

i could say whats on my mind right now, but i'll save it for when he's sober <:lul:305559915714576385>

other than that one time
shes into kinky shit
well its for ps4
<:gwnonexmaikasmug:402867199825674251>
why does mute not fucking work on the bot
it’s still only christmas #1 tho
merry christmas
so my average day for the past year consists of 7:51 of sleep, 3:20 warframe, 2:39 school, 1:40 with eyan, 1:36 with family, 0:57 on homework, 0:37 in the car, 0:36 on reddit, and everything else is bellow half an hour so its inaccurate
hmmm sleep what a good idea
christmas merry
happy christmas exclusively to those who dont celebrate
theres a second one?
how loosely?
id join and sing but my throat is missing
i might pop into the stream later when my family is not here and i actually have peace and quiet

deja vu
rise up
i can deal with this
duel me
they don’t reach a peace, that’s alright
you got this
time to get some pistols and a doctor on site
you have him turn around so he can have deniability
you pay him in advance, you treat him with civility
oh god
it was amazing
honestly, i'm stupid proud of that timing
hmmmm
oops?
that's me falling out of my chair
how can men be so fucking dense
like what the fuck
at any given chance
are you calling eyan stupid
did rainy just get cursed
it's a mess
mucho mejor
if eyan had infinite density shouldn't we all be accelerating towards pittsburgh at infinite speed
depends on starting location and end destination
yes danit
oh my
what
did i say an expensive skin?
fuck you
i'm in school, so that's where it's spent
not rn
so like
panda can’t math
i’ll try to. i haven’t played in a while
eyan, go to mag with me, i'll cosplay star guardian ahri
weird, me too
tsa broke a $400 prop
eyan
nevermind
we can’t hear you. at least i can’t
all of my attraction
hear who
ehhh
oh im stupid
go to hell, robot
i'm just drunk
it's one of those big neckhole ones
wait get one for me while you're at it
i paid and played
thanks! hope you all have a good day
no thanks lol
you're just noticing?
how do you think i'm getting that cosplay bod
eyan
nerds
considering i dn't die of hangove
you know you love it, babe
reminds me of infintie hover in jak 2/3
panada. do i have you on steam
wow, eyan just called me cute
we killed him
no clue how it works tho so rip lol
me and my sister were playing smash this morning, on the gamer stage
i wasn't here when that happened
also she's your age, i'll introduce you, she also loves gamers rise up and prequel memes and warframe and is about your age
holy fuck
supposedly i havent joined the steam group before now lol
honestly, 9k has filled much better role of god than any christain god has
how dare you assume assumptions
what is sleep
fuck
you always do, babe
awww
dumb
heed
scream
you like drunk me?
he's dumb
did you see that density chart
night guys ^w^
nighty
and also to god
so not like he'll consider not saying yeas to anything for a second
considering the amount of alcohol
master got sent to the gallows
i think she wants to blow me or something, unfortunately, i'm more dense than a black hole so i'm not really sure
oh everyone's gone
i probably will soon enjoy, i fucking love hiking
haven't gone on any this month, probably a good idea to go burn off the like 4000 calories of booze anythe 300 calories of christmas dinner
why do you say that? did you steal $11 from me?
i am a cheap date for real, i look for the chicken on the menu and order like the cheapest thing, if not a salad
i got an electric blanket for christmas and it has helped wonderfully to alleviate cold
7% but i'll ignore it on rainy's behalf
lol, i know i'm weird
you seemed to be quite interested at one point in time
sure
gimme a sec, i gotta get back in character
also eww
you're right
it's okay, i am too
i mean, you could be like rainy, she's interesting, but it cost her her soul
being that awesome doesn't come free
i never had a soul to being with
i mean, people in general arent very interesting. they dont have character arcs to follow and no cool powers. they just complain and use resources until they roll over and die
please don't, lol
i mean
oh, so we're role playing now
enlighten me, why?
it's such a bother to have to keep turning all caps on and off
because you are innocent
my response to it is "yeah, you like that you fucking retard"
rainy said this [2:01 pm] thy queen, zealots: you can just yelll at me, i'm into it
fair enough
r/askreddit i assume?
there was some story on reddit about things people accidentally said during sex and that story blew up and went full scale meme
same, they feel like a waste of time
they probably won't, just saying, that's the kind of thing where all it takes is that one asshole to screw it all up
kinda like how i could park out front our hotel until somebody got caught and then there was a massive crackdown on it
i don't call him that, master is a... reserved term for me
where'd my queen go?
i was wondering who you were referring to
thank you my queen
so just as a warning, dont get mad if it is very stupid
don't worry, i can definitely get more mad
yeah, for once i agree with eyan
are eyan and rainy dating?
no, please do
all of em
you'd have to be some eyan levels of dense
gonna need you to explain that one to me
she just likes fucking with me
go to hell robot
that'd be giving too much credit
does it ever not?
that's not how being dense works
i'm also surprised
this day is draggin
also you only got what, 2 hours left
dumbass
normally it's like 40-50 minutes depending on how fucked i get, but it should be 30 tops today
say they're funny
what a tragedy
unfortunately
look
and rome wasn't built in a day, i know all too well that looking beautiful takes time
i blame rainy
that's how i felt yesterday, but i think that's just called  a hangover
new year's isn't until next week
new year new me
i'm capable of trying
pfft, that's up to your discretion
just gotta gimme the word to release it
obviously
of a useless goddess?
e!google glass of water
materials for everything else: <$80
yeah that sounds about right
rainy only shared one of the two cat pics
so do i, i built a youtube channel off of it
what's the least ajit part of florida?
who's being dense now
don't ruin my fantasy eyan
should we document dragonite as an scp
i'm gay now
wait
just saying
if you must specify a playable race, probably balgruuf the greater
who is the hottest male character in skyrim?
yeah that
too much stress
i can make any cosplay for any body, given enough... experience with said body
you won't stop me from handling you sexually? wow, truly a scholar and gentleman
why would i not be?
there are quite a lot of medical students though
picky, are we?
good job (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
hmmm
people like complaining more than money duh
nice
technically i'm referring to my ap system, not windows
we have children?
hmmm
i didn't even know we were dating let alone that far into things
i get his cat
i get the pc
i miss a lot when i’m busy working and not being here ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
"rainy - guru & queen of ass"  something like that?
(dont worry the hard drives will be incinerated)
a-sofs
but i dont know if i could handle that responsibility
i ain't eyan's s tuff
highly effective
oh look, rainy is finally understanding how i became more dense than a black hole
me right now
well, it's up to her, lol
what were your expectations?
you're good at drawing a bunch of scribbles and pretending they're instructions
are you?
i wanted to go to prom, but
alcohol?
same
ill get the flamethrowers
a lot of people look back at high school with at least *some* degree of fondness
but i wanna dance
eyan you just need to learn how to optimize your talents, is all
black 2 and white 2 came out
oh wait that's for the smoking campaign
i didn't choose anything last night
thank you for that
that was worth it
plot twist, i was gay all along
fuck all that
now see what you did
btw, 9k, set our permissions for the voice channels to include anything prehistoric frog and above
and thus rainy cried
no idea what you're talking about but okay
hmm?
i never would have guessed from the name
what's with you and baconators?
imagine being assassinated by someone who uses a knife and fork for their pizza
steam apparently understands me
it recommended a game called boobs saga
so it was _you_ who sent me the free trial of playboy magazine?
you'll notice i said "mostly"
it's not your fault
probably
you dont have to give us an exact number, just the data type that would be required to store them
i'm sorry
huh, maybe i don't have you beat then, technically i only have 3 but i had a fourth that was close
i doubt she remembers half the names
cause if we're going with one date, then, uhhh... lol
and i can just go back though my google account that i use for tindr contacts
i'm here to shine bright and bring everyone else down with me
yeah but with even more ways to start an explosion
like all over the damn place
i sort of always imagined rainy is the personification of a nuclear bomb
the deepest emotional connection i've had heretofore...
i'd say she needs to aim
well i'm not
zero
how depressing do i wanna get with this?
no swearing.
i don't wanna build emotional connections with anyone
backup brains, i burned through 3 of them in my theory final yesterday
yeah that would take a while then
probably wise
oh yes

<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
everything
my two year+s with men permanently scarred me (one literally) and my year+ with a girl is still my friend
the heart wants to beat
the heart wants a beating
therefore brain is stupid
case in point
but on the other hand the brain gave us video games
yeah but brains also invented the lobotomy
that sounds like a problem that can be taken care of at a later point in time
stop
granted i haven't looked at any of em
i type, send, and than ignore
i mean i wouldn't have put it past me to have sent a few to random people by accident
you should send them to random foreign emails
i mean
keep it on
play smash bros.
because you complain about being tired
unless it's to x person/people who shan't be named
same honestly
cause in it's time, it was fucking stupid
i'm calling you fucking stupid
not brilliant
so you're tired you say?
you were
you're welcome
driving trip continues, i'll be there at like 1
we stopped at some store to buy tomatoes and cucumbers
but we can't test that theory
clearly
oh shit
bring me some takis to apologize
<:roodab:509458870700212235>
i ain't picky
lets get it
so it works out
more or less
lmfao
shall i spam it
<:roodab:509458870700212235>
good shit girl
so it doesnt really matter
i dunno, next summer
eyan
but it wouldn't be authentic
but alas
hmm, i'll move to st catharines, seems like my kind of city
i just wanna live in canada
no promises
what kinda breakfast do you prefer?
alright, fine, i'll take the pic after i make you breakfast, if you're clothes aren't on by then you're a lazy fuck
wait no
but eyan
oh right it's still not magfest
probably not
yo wtf
can i come in the middle of it than?
you will not escape coffee
fair
that it is
nice
we have acquired the vip, back in another 50
i'll be long gone
hear me out
tim horton's is 👌
yo right
none of them are talos
unless it was just a jebait
okay artemis and aphrodite are actual gods so props to you for using actual gods
but not my god
actually isaac brock
empire loves lists
i also love tea
move everything else down a step
so a clean 10 now ok
me or 9k?
that last name is neat
the christians are so boring with one jackass
this one sounds like a party
no offense to any christians in here but your religion robbed me of the first 16 years of my life
even thought mike is still alive
and jack daniels
that stuff is just... no
to make a molotov with?
making a molotov without vodka is heresy
wait you mean it's possible?
i'll let you know later
so the vip we picked up is now talking about various religions to my dad
pffft
it' s better tho
yeah it is better the vip is roasting dad's bad management
doesnt sound like anything new
whos the manager?
and then the vip starts screaming mother of god at an average sized deer like 50 ft away from the road
the anti-virgin
wait panda is?
power of what?
rainy have you tried a preschool that doesn't have catholic influence?
he wants anything
please
my ego
if you make that graph
i will add on another dirnk to what i owe you
well it's certainly not the heaven i want.
flubs
such a sucker for food?
anywhere
megumin, put her close to but below me
also hi friends lol ^w^
hiya will
that scale tho lol
thanks deci and panda for setting the curve
i am aroused
i work in a hispanic restaurant
ok rain
can you fill this out
precesely
i'm just going through discord look for things i called god at any point
it's a metroidvania hack n slash
and the 100%+ percent come from things outside of the game universe
fidget killed god
this is fidget, she killed god
that's the only material i know on top of my head cause it sounds like weed
my favourite thing about that game is that fidget makes a resi4 reference
rude
thats less than not productive
hell yeah
but i keep sitting in discord and staring into space
skyrim?
it's the goddamned skyrim engine
time is math
i'm into it
time off means memory decay
it has a purpose
integral of y dx
should be fired
why did he design malaria
just integrated one of the craziest functions, got this as the answer lul
not much, you?
#blamerainy
and i can’t fall back asleep because i’m hungry
but you won't go the fuck to sleep
i’m just glad i have today off. but i probably won’t be able to take a nap for a little while
uh ok then
i'm much more at home in inkscape than gimp, but i'm learning, i think.
and i told you to go the fuck to sleep
oh, so we want to debate semantics of what is possible vs what is justified?
that's deep
that's another large point in the "pros" column
i wish it was time for lunch
fuck off mee6
oops all caps
also hi ida, i played your gift on stream last night
i love the genre though so i'll never not like metroidvania
the number one reason i want smash is to play castlevania, lol
the number one reason i want smash is because smash
he'd be way too op
i figured the end of the year would suck for this job, but god does it suck
yeah, and?
i'm just depressed
when that shit comes around i'll have to settle for not actual nerds cause all the actual nerds will be fucking their computers
ooh, yummy.
i mean, milk chocolate is fine if it's what you desire
wow 9k, i've never seen someone on here have such a correct opionion
dark chocolate is where it's at
you're wrong on the grounds that you annoy me
dark chocolate reflects the bitter, stygian nature of my soul. i have a connection to it that spans the eons
he's just dumb, he doesn't know what he's saying
also, who the fuck spends 1609.58 on a 100 napkins
we shall rest when we are dead
this kingdom doesn't actually have rules against any type of death
you see the trick is to do that before you leave the shower
try harder
~~they love each other~~
this is too lewd
how's saturday at 6 sound?
pardon me, i am as dense as the entire universe packed into a tiny spec of spacetime right before the big bang
my place
you want her to give you a not dumb reason?
real life is dragging me out of my coffin
imma take an aside to say i have a great butt.
i just had the anime scenario of trying desperately to get my new jeans over my butt
that's cause you're stupid
i have several chapters of gov notes to take care of before that which i haven't started on either
and the reading is a nice one that i usually have to cram into a few hours so this will be a nice change of pace if done right
sounds like it’s doable at least
mmmmm
listen here you little shit
quadruple doesn’t seem like enough
eyan what's the integral of 3dx
i mean, i got a b
but in high school, that was failing for me
high school was hell for me
oof no reminders about gpa
but i had just over 1500 on sat and 34 on act
so applying for schools is fun
not really, i didn't try that hard, lol
but i don’t remember much of any spanish
took one, did fuckall on the english and essay portions, somehow got 1440
my condolences rc
english however, required 4 credits. so, you had to take one every year
hope so
why would i though?
eyan
mmk, that's acceptable
yeah, dia
kinky
i have no siblings, but i look forward to fucking with my cousins in the same way
that should answer all questions
my restaurant already has a well designed site, unfortunately
oh yeah that works
that's
but the pixel count
it's in the show
the blonde's outfit on my desktop is one of the cosplays i have now
cause i feel like that should be prerequisite to meeting me
they have icons
any chance you could get me the thor "does he...?" meme
for like, everyone
i see you're on the winning side
that one?
maybe
if the rapture happened would it resemble the snap?
i expect nothing less
even the bot hates me
curiosity expands the known data set to expand a search for potential patterns which can in the long term simplify the work necessary to get a desired answer
he does proc the censor on edits thought
how many people sailed out into the unknown and were never heard from again before one managed to find a new land?
yeah, we're all just sentient links in a very long chain of evolution. the way we sway will have an impact on the future for others
neither does living another 10 years
sure it does
sure having them around is great for then and there but that impact is limited. if that group does manage to find somethi- this is the part where i realize i have no idea where i'm going with this
being curious is an emotion, emotion is illogical
something about elon musk wanting to have other companies put him out of business
are we planning on re-implementing the naughty words censor or something
actually it doesnt
that's a topic for down the road
also master im disappointed you did not save fus go fuck yourself
fair enough
what is a man
hmmm
in a good way or a bad way
curiosity creates long term gains at the price of potential short term losses if you're not careful
doesnt automatically invalidate them all
eyan isnt it past your bedtime
that's what curiosity gets you
wait that happened?
if you ever think you did something stupid, just remember, at some point in human history someone decided to squeeze a cow's udders to see what happened _and it caught on_
and are they still alive
do you have any data on how often questions in this server actually end with question marks
what is a man
so one to one reply to valid conditions should be fine
some people are into that
jesus is into drinking blood
you mean tomato juice right
it's symbolic ya ninny
>for 10 million, i think my wife would be there cheering me on.
nice
ok so yesterday you defined who was in the pantheon
well i'm out until later, so it'll have to wait
i have stuff to do for the next hour or so
by the 8
ask about the most obscure thing possible
eyan it's just an array chill
also fuck the thalmor too
no, no, fuck that presumptive and pretentious piece of human filth
mages can cast beneficial spells on others, does that make them gods?
hey that wasn't nice squid
most of the time
nice ping time
hmm it magically came back
this is a good one to start with
i'll be home in 20 and beat all y'all's asses
i never let it get that close, i'm always 4 points ahead
good luck have fun
when does the day start?
i got up at like 8 am
good enough
you live
chocolate chip?!
the precision of this spreadsheet is an art
so does string theory
go for it
but reading the room, that may not be best
you mean booze?
yeah just mix booze with snowberries, moon sugar, and frost salts
spiced brandy
yeah
did anyone else wanna play cah?
i'm okay
just reeeee
we're playing for second place
don't underestimate my power
cards against humanity isnt a game you play to win. its a game you play to make as many dark jokes as possible
but he doesn't have to be up
eyan you're ok with boring
they have really good chais
i mean, you're invited if you want ida
guys go to sleep
i can't wait to go crash at eyan's hotel whenever he's working night audit
haven't we all?
too tired?
and bloody marys
i mean....
i was a daytime bartender at 17
cause you said $25 a month
except on sundays
if someone gets hurt, that's an assault charge
oh i can assure you
do you though?
but eyan
i could just what?
pay attention to me
i look gay in glasses
am i not worth the effort?
pancakes/breakfast in general
so i love em
preference of hair color
when i get pink nu i get a dab emoji
<:treason:396483914803445761>
does he go on the pantheon?
he portrayed an emotionally confused late teen rather amazingly
sipho dias is the real mvp
i like my girls with short hair
blob:null/24c29de3-9b1e-4a3a-802d-469d552825e2
i'm not your queen, i am the queen
i kinda want to join the call

if you think i'll forget this... this indignance
"are you having a fucking chuckle" -rainy rn
good place

a perfect culmination
go to the store sometime this week
alright glhf
cold
i am when i want to be
so, never?
i kinda wish i was at work right now, so much regret will be had tonight
around here at least
that was a very fitting response actually
think of all the pretty things you can buy me
i finally got a new keyboard
proud of you
i got myself bloodstained today
but i get tired of playing it in long spurts >.>
~~other than me~~
i'm just watching castlevania videos to pass the time, so yes
thats pretty troll
which one
i'm never bored
i'm never bored, just attention starved
guess who just spent three hours building a house in terraria
speaking of sleep, i must do that now
my next one is *probably* gonna be a treehouse
e!bot
i *think* i know how to
step one: try to diversify with multiple woods used
4tn1te
thonk
she just wants me to call her mommy
it also may have been spillover from dc
oh yeah you missed thsi thing
which happened to permeate like 1.5 states
you call that nicely
she was giving pieces of information and i wanted to have it all mapped out nicely
my critics are... usually shortlived
i call that a clusterfuck
i was distracted scp readings
better.
just saw coffee
im out of coffee...
is it better than regular coffee?
what will cup of java give you
i've still got 4 hours and 35 minutes
yeah thats right skarm
the drawstring that i normally take places is got a bunch of holes in it
stream nerds
happeh newowo years

<:ceselaayaya:506890802707038209>

👀👀👀👀

👀👀
the turnpike has opened up to three lanes though so theres probably less than 70 miles left
"no it's pennsylvania"
sleeping past 8 on a day off is as normal as normal gets for me
good job
same thing
or did you get half as much sleep as you intended
hungover stream
wouldnt the light from the screen hurt his eyea
did anybody else ask?\
there's a lot of stuff i want to pick and choose from
there are a bunch of people who tell me it's good, should i submit to defeat and join them?
just buy another hard drive
those are full too
hmm should i join stream or get things done for the first time since forever
lmao he started singing in another server so it continues here
good job unicode (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
i'm gonna buy a suite so that i can cook shit... though i don't think gaylord suites have ovens... hmmmmm
what do you even do at conventions
everything
d&d is probably something i'd love, yet have never touched
have you ever eaten at the sports bar thing inside the gaylord? every time i dropped by the wait time was like an hour long
also ida, oh honey
i will host d&d&d in my room at mag
oh wait wrong thing
how sweet of you
nice
that's next year
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
other than maybe disappointment
i mean, i have no expectations for you
i have class again on monday and really not looking forward to it
i had classes today running off 3.4 hours
thanks quitcorrect
but i also need to scan 14 pages
scan?
also is that new profile pic from a comic?
....what
considering the one you just asked doesnt
parents franchise documents for who is going to what events and who's paying how much
i scan hundreds a month
you think scanning 14 pages is bad
just like me
i'm so sad i missed out on the peak of vr chat
it was fun seeing him
havent seen him in a year or so
scanning is easy when youre able to stand
i like sleep, dunno why i tried to get as little sleep as possible for so long
oh wait i know why
pi vpn
i dunno, however much force it takes to stop ~50kgm/s of momentum
then that depends on how long it took
fast reaction time and immediate stop to forward momentum
nerd
yo that name is cursed
feel better kugal
don't you do it
well welcome back, bac. we missed you.
maybe one n
i find it weird how i can rename myself in literally every other server i’m in but it’s restricted in this one
i agree
i find that actually to be wrong
like i dont get whats up with that
i remember watching that damned pokemon pearl playthrough
how much can i cuss
i was gonna test it out
to test the system
literal scan. gg
also the system is mildly broken right now so yuo really dont want to test it
not as rarted
how do you play skyrim

also hey there new friend
don't bring jesus into this
to quote eyan from earlier today, " you're not my mother"
thats a good quote master
besides this is more or less what they should expect
ok skarm take a few steps back
screw this bot
yeah if we act normal in the beginning its just gonna make the truth even more horrible
and looking for somebody to love
oh, congratulations
oh no, it's a terrible thing
oh my

<:gwomoraphiohmy:405784196783538196>
<:kappapride:379352530863521792>
hey eyan
i know i am
it doesn't mean you're not cute tho
<:gwfateesip:392307687955628034>
speak for yourself
and i'm not sure, but i can say *i* haven't bit you.
ooh fun
victorian
i love night shifts
no no
whatever its called. sounds great
is that a thing now
oh ok
it's the uv radiation of the sun that's the issue
uv radiation
not uv light
it does, but in miniscule amount
but the usually coincide
hopefully
can i just live inside of an x-ray machine
well you aren't allowed to be sad
hello gambit but with boobs
constantly be blasted with radiation
valid
according to the song
i love d&d i just wish i had more spare time to play
by putting down the things he doesn't like
besides the 5 different campaigns ive played the first like 12 hours of and then they all just slowly petered out and died? not much really, actually playing it is quite fun as a dm or a player
i recently just finished a campaigng
you can run short games periodically or just once a week. or if you got the time and energy full 15 hour games
ive just never found the right people to play with. theyre all fun and nice, they just dont keep consistent enough schedules to play ever
i feel personally attacked
honestly, i just don't have time and other people for tabletop gaming nowadays. aside from the rare instance that i do.
with discord and roll20, for example
i ruin everything :)
what else does it say
according to this book, eyan is too much of a coward for us to date
so, play read dead or hear eyan preach more about investment banking <:thinkingsteps:396534879833292810>
god i hate children
stream.
rather unfortunate indeed
you mean almost by "all 3 were nearly killed" or "the number of children i have killed is approaching 3"?
i just hate all kids
i woke up at 11 pm
i can
astrophysicist carl sagan?
skarm shut up
half the time that's when i end up going to sleep
oh right, eyan’s birthday is today
help
what happened to wolverale?
i still think <:kappa:374346980136058893> looks similar to emile
i'm assuming that's there as a joke, considering candyman is the only with it.
just now?
also wait
i think i have an idea which rumor that is, considering this might also be the one gamexplain discussed about last night
<:kappaclaus:520412032042926080>
> fault
thats right, "always"
at the very least, i hope we get a mini direct like last january
yeah, skam
no they are not
so all of us are free to abuse your bot then, since he did it to us first
i don’t know actually
are you feeling okay? that sounds awfully low
we are
also am i the only one who finds it weird how someone would want to avoid knowing about dlc content
just a thought
hmmmm
other way around here, sleepy but not tired
so go ahead
and i know that difference better than most
every day is master's birthday
but sleep is still a solution to exhaustion
i am lonely, i am gay, i have depression
you're not wrong
i am very opposed to doing something
that was a very heavy "uhh"
the only reason i'm here is because eyan is
as most things are in my life
eyan leave
yes you are
its for your own good
what am i saying
he just admitted it more or less, lol
nah, just depressed
its just a matter of doing it
hey look on the bright side though
noted
i can't tho. i clock of at 7. i still got like most of my shift.
is that am or pm
uh....retail :)
do you work in the loading bay
i did that for a few days and basically ceased existing
this has probably been posted here before but i can’t be bothered to look through the few months of stuff i’ve missed so here
yeah flubs is
ooos it’s one
hate it how that just kinda happen s
didn’t feel like it at all
oh yeah thats me
i ws going to make a joke but i decided against it
im bad at type
im not a fan of onions
i am mostly just fond of them on burgers
pretty much try every food at least thrice
well next 4 hours
the point is to get drunk i dont care what it tastes like
i didn't ask about taste lol
when i *do* care about what it tastes like, ive got ~300 bottles of wine in a cooled storage locker
i think a game crashing on a loading screen is better than it just loading forever
your hope dies suddenly instead if being dragged out and slowly bled out
in the show
the first pokemon ash is shown to have is a voltorb
just name daniel robert gheesling, maybe include a home address or something
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
<:king:356095432495202315>
woke up to see star wars on. nice
idaaaaaaaaa ive been listening to people talk about d&d all weekend and i really wanna play but i cant sit still for that long
when we start doing annual zeal meetups we can play for a few hours each time
genius
so you know how
i'd have to go with switch
that’s fair.
4 is unlucky thats why
this is quite the predicament
because the earlier ones could also play ps2 games
get the gpu of the ps4 and cpu/ram of the switch, then you can play both
oh yeah that one too
bloons
that's also still dependent on what p5r actually is. it might just be a racing game for all we know.
until like, 6 in the morning
oh damn
nice
you guys wanna waste more time with league?
currently not home, so i would join later
thats why im waiting for the netflix version of the cw shows
20 is not bad.
i mean, we spend time more on games yknow?
that’s the point, i like seeing people’s reaction when it’s going on
but then you watch everything super late.
~just rewatch the crossover all summer~
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
i’ve only seen it a couple times... its not even about the game.
i get to into movies
oh hey it’s back on
except for 2015
i doubt thats legal
as a mets fan i lead a life of annual disappointment
game of the year material right there
goodmorningall
not gonna lie the only game i want on swich is smash
oh yay a ps4 vote. thanks arkada
ps4 is also entering its last few years until sony releases its successor. which would most likely be backwards compatible
so far the games i’ve played on pc don’t do as much for me as console games have
did somebody say miku?
look at his sub animation
i have
oh my god
can i share them in this chat?
never thought of it
yes eyan
i have a miku print somewhere but all my past con stuff is kind of just shoved away waiting to actually be displayed one day
that way you have an idea when you are financially ready but cpu and motherboards change so quickly youd have to make some changes when you are ready
dat essay though
and that is my second essay for the day thank you
also i have acquired pizza
i mean
i can get him to stop if you want
one day
driving is for nerds
its just lazy walking
driving is my sanctuary when i am a sad boye
all the important places are nearby
rush hour kills 20 minutes on my drive home compared to normal
"empty" streets are nice
i like where i'm at, cause it gives me the peace i desire but i'm close enough to a city that at least has stuff to do if i ever desired it
we have to drive 25-30 minutes to do anything
and you arent taxiing across the city if you live there
the midwest is not even close to an accurate representation of where i live, lol
i enjoy cities when it comes to visiting but not when it comes to living. i will never live in a city
steal the silverware for yourself, then
i take it that the midwest is no longer high noon land
i’m not giving you alcohol
no thats rainy's go word
however
is it that, or a natural godsend?
disaster
where i live our biggest concern is tornados
im like part of tornado alley tho
yeah, northeast is good for dodging natural disasters, the worst ya get is snow
that one just really hates new york
yeah but new orleans isnt even that big
still big enough to do a lot of damage
wacky? really?
also we're pretty good at moving a lot of people around quickly
true, there aren't just roads in new york. there's also the subway system
hurricanes scare the heck out of me i'm glad i dont live near the water
well that's not really anything new for hurricanes in general
the residents are cannon fodder no matter what city they're in when a storm goes for the particular city they're living in.
the more south they are, the worse they are.
return of the jedi is now starting
ah, return of the jedi, what a classic
i dont know what youre talking about
lol rip
yeah
those maps they show you in school are all wrong
also birds arent real and the moon is a myth
satorl marsh is probably the butt tbh
wait a sec
i'm never too drunk for investment banking
eyan, my honour has been bismirched, defend me
okay, now they have the right to die
well that is just rude
oh they're long gone.
i mean, why wouldn't i defend you, lol
so yes i agree that brawl has the best music
why do people ever feel like that?
they probably just felt like being dicks
i've got one open, currently
sounds like a plan to me
rainy have you ever piloted an automobile
same as g
though with working at a hotel, i feel eyan has more available
good job
understandable
i don't know if i'll be able to negotiate what g is getting for night audit, but i can hopefully at least bump my wage up a buck and maybe a little extra if i'm lucky
cant you just get more out of candyman?
you make a compelling argument
i certainly pay dividends though.
i'd like to think that eyan knows better
but you can still think of all the really pretty things you could buy me.
eyan knows a good relationship will be an expensive one regardless
eww fries
i usually prefer thinner and crispier, mushy fries make me sick
so shoestrings over steak?
one if my favorite con memories is having an older japanese man teach me how to properly and safely tie up my partner in bed 😊
ever had a gretan, arakda?
i'll see if i can find one.
potatoes are just starch presented in different ways
he's a doctor now
ughhhhh
so i'm at less than 15 in the past 72, why god. why?
i have so much tired
yeah, economy, sorry
something must be wrong
to be fair, i wouldn't want to watch last jedi again anyways, lol
every time i think about that movie, i think of more ways it pissed me off, lol
i'm never bored
wanna play league?
i'm just glad that j.j. abrams is directing episode ix
i do it for rey
cutting out the parts with finn probably would’ve helped
i don’t usually hear why the prequels were bad
i agree demon lord, i'd much rather have abrams back
i'm sure a lot of the critics who loved it were paid by disney lol
do u mean gratin
the fuel is what matters
i forgot that’s a thing here
if i recall correctly rainy paid $10 for that
same
that it is
by almost an hour
i just wish i had more outlet's. since my pc/internet has been a bust for months all i have is my laptop. so i'm very limited on what i can do. im tired of watching movies, anime, youtibe videos. i'm bored and sad. not a good combo tbh
playing games with friends/on my own. when my wifi was semi decent i'd stream stuff so my friends could watch ;_;
take up gambling
have you tried stardew valley?
you want to get more out of what little free time you have?
that's a good way to just delete free time
story of my life lol
oh it is, i've enjoyed playing through the world of light
they should have ryan reynolds cameo in dc and starwars movies
a character that was on screen long enough for me to recognize her, then the entire planet blew up.
neet
jeez 9k, it's like you aren't even mlg lvl 30 in btd5 *or* btd6
what?
rude
yeah we dont talk about that one
ooh congrats
i didn’t read it tho
<:gwoiczenthink:390299938250293250>
go outside or something <:kappa:374346980136058893>
did he go get a drink
last time it took 9 mins before she left
i didn't know when my last save was, but it was only ~15 minutes
not even on pc yet
chief is microsofts mario
nobody would expect that now
a manakete would be sick as hell, but it won't happen
it's an echo fighter for lucina
my dumbass just hit the power button by accident
welcome
we can make a night of it
non-stop
eyan has been popping a lot of bloons
rainy i gotta warn you
he is competitively ciable
yes he does
he's b tier
but one you play him
of who the third character might be
xenoblade chronicles' composer did a remix of gangplank galleon and it's nnnnnnnnnnffff
piranha plant, joker, and -redacted-
yeah
i think it'll be a final fantasy rep
oh ok
for that 3rd character?
what game
i know i am but what are you, eyan
with two games so far
wow did they even try
also again
dark pit is s tier
eyan
eyan
if you do a dark pit cosplay with me i'll do palutena
a "cosplay"
you'll be extra down
she's hotter than you remember
nice!
i played a fair amount of link too
excuse me for my french but
that was my 616th
my queue is bugged
hello
also
iowa is in central
that was a fantastic last game
by at least two hours
i have terrible taste in men apparently
anytime you want
oh goody
if i knew why i was sad
i'd complain about that instead
just dont be sad lmao
butts are better
you have some low spec games to play?
what's up lol ^w^
same lol
plus i enjoy typing
ooooh they have the watchmen movie on netflix. i havent seen it and wish i realized that three hours ago
bella i thought you were like, 18 lol
nope
which co-worker?
ha, it's not even 1 here
darn it, stay in place
i think that is the ultimate way to catch your attention. just yell "boobs" out in public and bam eyan appears like "yooo"
just a hunch
i havent watched robocop
no the suit is what makes them look pretty
yeah but it explains boobs
majestic heres the actual spoiler part for someone who isnt familiar with the game at all: then the infestaiton made the minds of the warframes basically non-existent so then the tenno transferenced into them
night bella ^w^
that sleep schedule tho o.o
don’t call me dan, dan
you are saying
did you just call me candy dan
i've killed people for less
candyman kill me
this is a fucking wild prediction considering that game was...well, kinda shit in comparison to the rest of the prime series
which means it's perfect advertising for it
hey, kamui uses a chainsaw
who do you guys play as
he's definitely the last metroid character that i think can be reasonably added to the lineup
really, not many classic metroid characters are characters i think they can reasonably add to smash
kraid is a part of one of the brinstars
and i trust retro to do something
"oh yeah lets release prime hunters shortly before prime 3 and then do fucking nothing with anything we did in that game"
here's hoping no executive meddling happens. it looks like samus will make a full recovery from being on hiatus.
since hunters took place between prime 1 and 2
wait all the hunters are alive
i just think it's an out there choice that makes sense
i now see why it is rated t
skarm is retarded
and then there is 9k
that second part was uncalled for
some would say lord retard
the oversear
probably him
~~she probably bribed eyan~~
nay.. like a horse?
id let a stranger fuck me for 10m
cause like, then that's a triple win
paid for a house with sex
it's lovely dear
but i guess anything is a dildo if you're brave enough
i mean... its not like they have to watch it
hmmmm
and if i could get my partner involved in it, it's like a win-win-win-win
just be single forever like me
just answer once for yes, once for no
glad we cleared that up
did not mean to dc lol xd
there's a bunch of outfits that make the characters in their underwear and nothing else
alright
i said everyone, not everything
thanks
i'm reading an article about rockstar games and it casually mentioned that `this comes after the news last week that the xbox scarlett and ps5 next-gen consoles are expected to be announced in 2019`
that speech class is as hectic as i expected
it’s only not creepy if the standing person is hitchhiking. it’s creepy under any other situation
it was also followed by the man staring at me as he kept driving, with the creepiest smile ever. pro tip: don’t do that.
technically everyone has breasts
wasn’t even doing that either, so that’s when you know, that person is a bad.
something something work suck
hmm you might not object to that
eyan dont say the f word
it was on sale
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey they're making an open action/adventure one piece game
why did nobody tell me about this
fucking weebs
nope
gonna be taking english 11 of course, physics of course, us history of course, psychology, criminology, and calculus ii
boots
boots
pretty sure that was confirmed quite  whilel ago
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
also why would nintendo announce a direct for the 10th 3 days before it anyway
i'm pretty sure the official nintendo account hasn't tweeted anything yet
i don’t think any direct has been announced
isnt there always a big january blowout though
the 10th has been speculated for a while
you tried
what will we do with a drunken sailor
most problems are
that's cool
i'm sure i would do the same thing
but yeah gordon ramsay would be cool
yeah at some point i think i didnt really care
id assume the friction of moving makes that far more likely
but there's better air flow
aint no quicksand in my 10 square foot apartment but theres quicksand everywhere out there
just like that
i mean if you just walk through sand like that you probably had it coming
and i forget to ding the little bell thing
and then forget they exist until i find them in my subscription list eighteen months later and wonder who the heck they are
(◡‿◡✿)
speaking of which let's check to see how long the very first channel i ever watched has been inactive
agh my calc ii prof hasnt gotten back to me so now im slightly terrified he wont before the class begins lmao
oh man they actually still post a small number of videos every few years
i steal things and ruin lives, not use magic to fix stuff
is this like lwiay but for papa ryan?
ok then
wake up you hoe
did someone say bravely
cynthia would like a word with you
easy top 3
i don't recall hearing about the characters representing new franchises
probably something with sheep
i'm just excited for joker's gameplay trailer
i like how im already done with work for today
i just started
it just works
for the record it's "tertiary"
walked back into class as they were taking about memes
weird right?
maybe i should enter it into a virtual machine or something and find out
i haven't gotten anything really bad since about 2010 either. somehow around then i got an infection that caused my computer's printer spooler to stop working. that was fun. and a pain in the neck because in 2010 i had to actually print out stuff.
you and i speak the same language
python
don't worry rainy, i still like you
any preferences as to how?
weirdo
never claimed to not be normal
you can practically hear the whitespace
it just sounds like a gutteral hissing
as much as i want to give you attention rainy, it's my lunch break
rude
wait a minute
oh god who ungaged rainy
i literally just play to get diamond than quit
caged
haven't played since like a year ago
whenever the last season started
i'm at like 10, i want 6 more
sleeping makes me anxious, fuck my life
finger had a minor stroke
outer osmosis derived dinosaurs
i solve the issue of sleeping making me anxious by being too tired to be anxious about it
good thing i'm always tired
well that and i somehow overlooked the fact that he said we should do this again sometime <:rooderp:531156967943569410>
but i'm never tired enough
yes you do
you know but to ask, darling
oh wait, i might actually have a reason to be sad
you left it up to me and what i decided wasn't good enough
wow, not giving attention to me, so rude
what, do you like snow?
we should abolish snow
my heart feels at home
also, i only have one style of fashion and it usually involves a hoodie of some sort
and mag 2020, the year someone finally teaches eyan how to dress himself
i'm good at like
surprise me
10-20
although that feels like fricken forever ago now
it’s like how 2010 sounds really recent
save me some cake
dammit eyan, i fucking told you to save me some
girls don't eat cake
sounds like a bad year to me
the second i consume a single carb, all my abs will disappear
this is discord, shitbrains
maybe i should go back to bed
it really isn't
i mean, i believe it
i mean, so does getting slapped in the face
i just remembered how i used to wear hoodies in the middle of summer
i mean i'm not aiming high for life, namely because i want to get a red seal for an electrition
especially electritions, that trade is one of the highest deficits in canada
evidently
i’m not on yt much anymore but.. i shouldn’t be surprised

yo same
sylas when sylas steals shyv ult he has her spells for the duration
t b h
i am insulted
i was very on topic thank you
somebody asked me a question and i responded
stop being so popular
well, i'm doing my best, lol
hmmmmm
and how he's such a dad
maybe
which do you prefer
and with pleasure
alright, yeah, i'm in
you wanna play now or later, how you feelin
jeez
i don't need your negativity and discrimination eyan
also, are you guys playing overwatch without me?  cause that's rude
panda
will you though?
do talk more
soo much
yeah that
also what we playing
games stuck on a black screen
<:gwoiczenthink:390299938250293250>
stuck on "entering game"
just remove the 40000
budgeting 101 with panada
look i just said remove it
thanks
i'm giving my share to the people
they need food <:gwaobapepecry:395628671911854081>
that was fast
does anyone have any recommendations of what kind of parts i should buy for my pc in the spring time?
ok but i feel like there are better ways to do that
scrubs don't know how to use ctrl h
that would be good
are you trying to _reduce_ your job security good sir
for a gfx card
and i think there better than a 1060
what's his face
i literally dont know what you're talking about
sylas
thank you autocorrect
sylas shrugged
wait
rainy goes gay like 5 times a week, i'm not too worried about it
i mean why don't you say you're bi and get over with it
because rainy likes being complicated
but respectable
i generally only play one or two types of games, i only like a few genres of anime, i do the same things over and over
same
jesus christ you fucking morons
we know what you said.
nobody here was claiming that you said there was something wrong with vanilla
clearly
or at least i was
elaborating on their definition of being boring
most people side with the imperials though
ice cream is far more important
also do most people side with the empire? reddit is like 90% stormcloak lmao
i wonder if those are the same people who turned on nick in fallout 4
3/10 aela never wears that many clothes
or is that mjoll
time to go home
urf time
it's overwatch time
because usually theres also programming in there
men love boobs and skyrim
place your bets for how long it'll take before we optimize and talk about boobs _in_ skyrim
definitely.
there are no good boobs in skyrim
look up normal boobs
someone doesnt appreciate c u l t u r e
that too
the longer answer is that fake boobs are attached to fake women and these fake women are often idealized to what we like, making them innately more appealing than real boobs
controversial opinion: i also do not understand the appeal of boobs that are big enough to generate significant gravitational fields of their own
also 99% of fake boobs dont work at all like real boobs. the defying of gravity is mesmerizing
i prefer concave chests myself
boobs bring everyone together
what, contemplations of anatomical geometry?
no. i was just drawing lol
no  never
what's the point of boobs you don't share
can’t you like both?
butt wasn't an option
both*
lol what do you prefer panda
butt
i want pizza
all the good things hurt you
oh eyan
i was gonna say all boobs, but rainy's answer works too
eyan you probably have one of those anime mousepads with the wrist braces on the bottom dont you
this is all a figment of your imagination
i actually don't dragonite
<:rooderp:531156967943569410>
i know what i'm getting you for your birthday next year
except then i'd have to obtain one somewhere
if you're sitting at a proper angle, they pervent carpal tunnel
i spend literally all my spare time at my computer and ive never done anything like that to my wrists
excuse me what the fuck
fixed it
salud
izi pizi
i see there’s a party in vc or something
i'm having a hard time, just me and booze
doubtful
panda, you are my liquor
for my soul
rofl
still eatin tho
yeah, i do
one step
easy
define "doesn't look like it's from the ancient era"
sounds about right, dragonite
eyan tell them you're from the cia
crap im supposed to be cleaning my room brb
maybe. its a speech.
i cant write like anything
thats the problem haha
oh its a time limit, but i talk fast and its annoying
papers are so easy, bless
i just hated 99% of my classes
imma forget 90% of this speech
if i dont rush my words, it may be a solid 4 min speech.
i got an 85 in it
lucky
math. no. bad.
does your teacher spend like 45 minutes yammering about eye contact every single class too
people seem suprised by 500+ a lot
dont worry
arkada draw something else
i could, but i don't want to leave my other friends
<:oddonepog:509217203271499786>
back in brawl.
<:roodab:509458870700212235>
get me pizza
wonder how much work it would be to make my own
hmmmmmmm
you rang
later nerds, i need to focus
eyan
my presence is a privilege
oh, so you just don't like me
to panda
eyan didnt want you here anyways
rainy, come back
rain, rain, go away, come again another day
you guys still in vc
was just playing read dead when my xbox account randomly signed off, so the game restarted because i had to pick my account again and i have to replay a side quest. 😑
i wasted a lot of time tonight doing this
the protagonist of star wars
the sequels
hmmm
well since you asked, i'm currently on my weekend after a seven day work week
perv
and i don't look as hot as sneaky yet, but i can dress up and look better than that
and my current xcom character honestly looks exactly like me
i had a pixie cut in 2015, haven't cut it since
but i'm gay
i would so go back to gay for her
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
coward
that's why i pick at their food
but i let them order
i just won't eat
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
noctis is adorable
super good
attention?
that's hermamora
hmmmmmm
i'd be down to being bent over
oh i remembered why we aren't dating
i'm just so anti-investment banking
whichever on you are
virgo that's it
look bella it's nothing to be ashamed of
more like
the little mass-produced ones with memes on them and stuff
amirite
bella you didnt tell me you had a twin
better late than never i guess
there are things i should probably do but i dont feel like doing them
be lazy, it's fun
but they ain't cause you're investment banking is boring and you are a coward
rainy dont be rude to the one who can have you decapitated
this makes me want to look up zodiac stuff instead of writing notes for my speech.
which will probably happen
going to get food and probably sleep at a reasonable hour, eyan you should let rainy keep her head
go to bed you dumb fuck
i'll have you know my grandmother was killed by an astrology doubter
yes i am
alright
ever
go to bed eyan
of course i want attention
oh man
thanks for the reminder google
as in two days of me with my hair up working on essays all day at home, testing all day at school and forgetting to shower for once
game about the gays
it's a supernatural thriller
dumbass
i know c
what was it?
and hey, you love it
oh i'm not happy
lime what?
this is from work
an it reference
i make that specific reference all the fucking time
how did you not know?
but first
a motorcycle
this is what i'm getting in a couple years
i'm gonna drink another can of monster and then stream momodora
wow you fucking would
i'm not enough for you????
how dare you speak to me
fine, i'll leave then
how dare you leave
you already left me
now for the point of the night where i get existentially lonely and wonder why i told everyone to go to bed
oh good
ughh
the motorcycle i want to get
did someone say... panda onesie?...
okay
so really i'm just staring at my screen thinking about all the things i don't wanna think about
oops
i only got 5 full hours of sleep because i don’t know
that's why i got 6 hours of sleep
thunderdome 🤣
so tired...  v_v
good one
eh, that's your problem then
if i left at this point i worry you'd scarcely be able to maintain healthy autonomy
it's less maintaining health and more shifting dependencies
good morning <:roohi:510305569475657740>
debatable
what is sarcasm?
i’ve just been playing red dead all morning
same
i gotta work a short shift this afternoon
work
i plan to be superior than all of my fellow humans
i'm gonna start streaming just so i can have this as my follow alert
eyan, let me post in black omen
free game
one of my actual faves
spiderman grapple and parkour mechanics, it's good
hmm tfw i can't get audio unless i use my capture card ~_~
but i just did a flawless up turnip up throw up smash combo
i am so fucking good at video games
wow rude
ironically enough, the one time i do a thief playthrough, i really haven't used much stealth archery
i never claimed it to be honorable, lol
what kind of warrior?
cause i usually do beserker: alteration, two handed, light armor
i've done a fair number of nord playthroughs so usually two-handed, either light or heavy armor, block and then depending on the playthrough, ice magic, speech, enchanting, or maybe tossing in some one handed and block
guys one of these days we need to tie master and candyman down to chairs and indoctrinate, i mean, re-educate, i mean, enlighten them
it's treason then
<:treason:396483914803445761>
the dun
just so i can dress a cat
9:27 am] king of zeal: i am a dumbass and rainy is too good for me.
i don't believe you
uhhuuuuuh
to be fair, dunkey is toxic, lol
i've got 10 minutes to become a pro at daisy
irl stream? <:oddonepog:509217203271499786>
how close by do they walk?
install linux and then blame it
i'm proud of you dear
i'm not interested in losing
smash me
in not smash
that i can do
nice
are you talking to the robot again?
only if you rub me off instead
yeah
alright, going home
see ya'll in a few
many stories are already known dumbass, that's why they're stories
you said a story
oh boy, it's thursday, time for my weekly meal
you thought his story was great?
i been busy working on a twitch/ discord emotes commission atm
dat's cool shade, i shall let you return to your work then
also, rainy, it's not a weekly meal if you've already had a meal
ewww
but fried food makes me feel sick thinking about it
i like tofu eggrolls
i'd go there, but it's less than a mile away
i just played adventures of captain spirit so im invested in the universe again. send help
the only things that that's really happened with are potter and skyrim (not even pokémon, despite how much of that i played in high school)
y'all entertain me, it's like a four mile walk
those are few and far in between
but as long as it's an elder scrolls game i'll probably forgive it
the almighty thanos whale... has arrived
the almighty thanos whale has arrived!!!!!
hey panda can you post that kanna emote again
which one
but they are all valid
thanos laptop
thanos beyblade
bunny girl senpai is my choice for anime of the year
best anime is big chungus.
it had me actually smiling.
you have such wonderful and unreadable tiny squares
you're not a full thot
or we could just blow up utah and then leave it
but newvada
let's just blow up the entire midwest tbh
then we'd just have wyoming and not wyoming
foiled my plans
play the song
my life
no u
no wait
why do i only hurt the people i love
gottem
no you're all forgetting about the real best anime
in my opinion bunny girl wasn't that great
it's fine to have a bad opinion
wait are you trying to send me to gulag for wrongthink?
i mean don't get me wrong i like anime. just not funny girl senpai
bunny
i just got really angry at a game, so i’m wide awake :v
have you considered being nice?
imagine if someone complained about being thirsty, and they had water easily available to them, and you tell them to go get some of that water, and then they don't, and they continue to complain about being thirsty.
by that do you mean you will be nice to master and master alone, or do you mean you will be nice to master and literally not do anything else?
when people talk to each other, they never say what they mean. they say something else and you're expected to just know what they mean.
only the last seven years?
this body is older, but my residency in it is more recent.
gayest 7 year old i've ever seen
god dammit
""""""""""""respect""""""""""""
can confirm; i fall asleep best around 4 pm
which is why despite being a clinical insomniac, i still get in bed and get up at the same time daily
it was the weirdest thing ever
i'm actually a pretty productive member of society all things considered
just be like me
ignore dragonite he fuels bad habits
emptiness is the only truth of life
if you think that's fueling bad habits you would not like to see my dms
disappointed
you can put meaning into it, if ya want, if you're into that kidna stuff.
precisely
whoa whoa, where's my invite?
that's not bragging that's doing a good job getting your life on track
i don't know
trying things you haven't before is a good start.
gomp
unfortunately it is
(◕ ε ◕)
like not crash constan - oh wait it does that too
i just have a copy of photoshop from 2007 that i keep reusing the install code for over and over
it doesnt support animated png though which sucks
kind of what linus does in ltt
but with less words
wait are link previews off? i'm tilted
i mean  i have made some shit in premier like that edit i made that i sent to the meme chat
and i like typing words
i quite liked pinnacle, but that was before i knew what true editing power was like
movie maker was pretty nice
or at least i assume it was in like 2001
it was crap
but it got the job done for really basic editing
the movie maker template titles you used to use at the beginning of your nsmb were legendary
no but really when i was 14 and had no idea how people cut video together and opened up movie maker for the first time, it was literally magical
so back then, movie maker quality was good enough to attract an audience
that was fun
most of my problems were from me being stupid
same squid
and also it's honestly way more cutthroat at the bottom of the ladder (and the middle, and the top) and way less "hey let's have fun" now
i honestly think i'm just gonna shoot to do my weekly series idea and any let's playing i do will be a side project for fun
eyan i really want to make some smart remarks about that but i'll leave it alone for now
cause like i've said, i've spent this past week trying to look out for you and you say i'm being rude
you call me a dumbass
cause newsflash dumbass, be it one way or another, i like you, i don't call people i don't like dumbass
i call them asshats or fucktards
~~i just don’t like most people~~
anything else i can explain for you, sweetheart?
i like how we're suddenly having an academic conversation about the distinction between dumb and stupid and eyan
it's not a conversation, it's me explaining to the dumbass
it's just not particularly my style to call somebody i find endearing a "dumbass" lol
oh, i know it's your style, thus why i didn't take it as a downright insult, lol
it just doesn't really work well on me
please, i have no luck
i can do playful banter to an extent, but if i'm not in the mood for it or not particularly prepared for it, i can read it the wrong way
but i can respect that, so just know, that i'll never mean it spitefully, only endearingly, and i'll cut back on usage in which it could be construed negatively
angela did plenty of playful banter with me that i was cool with.  the problem she struggled with was when i wasn't in the mood and she upset me, she took it personally.  / shrug
i hope all of your depression is smited away
which is the perfect message for the new guy to see upon joing the server
eyan you free this saturday?
how are you today?
oh good
welcome, have a baconator 🍔
ahh yes
if one's not in the mood, we just cool it and support instead
i would probably just let them know in a normal way that i didnt like that joke
my personal issue with that
feels weird when you use that abbreviation
~~cause i'm real good at sucking dick~~
but let me post something in blackomen
it's a potion of ultimate healing
it's this
i only need it for a minute
i shall delete the bots as my first decree
can i take her place
are you a hot single in eyan's area?
beat me to it
i'm sure i could make myself hot
i count anything within one states distance "my area" with the exception of upstate new york
previews on
should i delete and repost it?
eyan very much rigidly defined everyone's perms on blackomen
but you know me
and then playing limbo
jesus
why did riot recommend me viktor
yeah please don't rainy
in more ways than one
someone else took care of that
pretty sure i'm the only one from new jersey
no but i've taught him all the memes so he could probably convince people that he is
i refuse to be upstaged by ninja bartender
hd supply can burn in hell
holy crap, the bot gave a very real response, lol
nutter, tell me a bit about yourself, are you nuts?  do you like eating nuts?  do you...  eh, i'll resist making inappropriate jokes for now
respectable
i am truly inspired by your words nutter
five what
uh, not really
that's about the best way to put it.
he's probably got one of the less accented skyrim voices
i can hear him say the line in my head though, lol
where i live, we say yinz
where are you from by the by
yinz is a term hailing from yinzer land, aka pittsburgh, lol
oooh, you're from across the pond
here
off to a real life ceilidh in a few minutes with an american friend
also from pennsylvania as it happens
something something 52!
i think shes from around philly
although she still claims to have won the superbowl
why do people not like philly again
i speak from a sports perspective
pretty tame if you ask me
but i don't have actual proof of that one
you weren't alive in 1994
well
status update grandma hates that the calculator i pulled up has trig functions and wants a more simple one
we live in a society
1990s: "we dont have enough features, add more"
2010s: "we have too may features, get rid of something"
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
alright, but you have to feed me as well
what kind of food do you like?
but italian is probably safe
i've cooked for many picky friends and partners
it's no secret i'm picky
well you can make choices now
and i love spicy, but i'm good at preparing food so it's mild and goes well with variable hot sauces
but that's the fun <:gwaobapepecry:395628671911854081>
or at least it is for me now
and i'm a good cook
also a baker
i had a friend who wouldn't eat anything with any form of tomato in it at all, and italian is my specialty
we're not friends anymore
good
lmao
also pasta is literally the only thing i make and half the time it still comes out overcooked so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
actually that's not true once i made this thing with chicken that came out okay. what was it called? i have no idea. how did i make it? i have no idea.
because if you don't bake your pasta you can go to hell
<:gwoicfidgetthinker:390299944910848000>
cause they're toxic
historically people have needed far few reasons to do things than they have to not do things
i think i just burned myself
am i in trouble
a squid walks into a bar.
so the correct wording would be "a squid _squelches_ into a bar"
i can imagine
thanks
i don't know what i want to do right now
isn't that what you want me to do?
i never said i objected
i questioned the real motive behind your statement
uhhhhhhhh
otherwise it gets kinda illegal, lol
right now, doing you is probably what would make me most happy right now, lol
and i find your vocabulary and sentence structure equally as charming
well i find your frequently retroactive tact entirely amusing and charming
good to know
also furret are just under two meters long
just realized baro is probably in town
sounds hot
i just want a roserade so my home would always smell fantastic and i could poison my enemies
that's what a koffing is for
i liked rosalia but couldn't catch them because i had emerald, but then 4th gen happened and oh god did i love roserade
glaceon is best though
10/10 tricky tanky ice type
yeah, i only know the 4th gen meta, lol
ice body restore health in rain
restore health in hail rather
iirc
of course, as a trainer, steel types are obviously my favorite
i totally might not
dunno
gardevoir is pretty nice
it's starts to get muddled after what i listed off
to show you
although i do reallly like milotic, easily in my top ten
primarina's nice but rowlett can move its face independantly of its head
<:keepo:327304799919800321>
more jpeg as ordered
he said jpg not jpeg
god damnit
she hasn't responded to my picture, lol
perfect
i got distracted
starraptor and murkrow are nnf
honchkrow, sorry
i like mismagius more than honchcrow
purple things
i can actually get either a mismagius or roserade, which should i get first?
out of like. what 700 now?
it's probably an odd fetish of mine, but damn do wedding dresses get me going
and then i shall be in pittsburgh in 27 hours and we will be watching rwby
and i guage everyone's romantic compatibility based on who in the show they are like.
i just know that i'd supposedly love the scythe girl
i always liked weiss
qrow is better
wow and two weeks again
spooky
i want one
one sec
does amazing rwby art
also
i also like this one
nice
dragon doesnt have a good matchup against steel anyway
the usual
i was lied to
im sure if you ask rainy for another she'll give it to you
is it safe?
gladly
whats that
just embrace it
so even he doesn't know
understandable
rainy no one ever said that
define normal?
oh, i have a good folder system, don't worry
if we're posting art
well, iris heart did
not plutia
i agree.
that ori pic is awesome
fit for posting
post it anyways
rainy why do you do this to me
look
as i knoght
i heard something about birdbox(?)
havent seen it tho
morag in a dress is adorable
black mirror bandersnatch was pretty cool
last village is already gone
my art folder was out of sfw stuff anyways
sad that this is how it had to happen
there are other security measures
also, i didn't know i could get more attractive either
ironically the smash censorship was a blessing for less than sfw images of mythra
i mean yeah that too
but that’s effort
zeke x morag melts my cold heart
fukc
realmaster, i am hurt that you think that way of me
pay up
that's actually pretty cool
i liked peach back in brawl, she was probably like, maybe my 4-5 that i'd occasionally play when i was bored of my mains
daisy is my current smash main
but gay
please if i'm stupid then that would make everyone else
even more dumb if i'm being honest
smug dead inside zelda is me
terraria is a game i really really really want to actually muddle through solo, but friends just make it a lot more fun
i just like this artist's style a lot
now i get to say bowser is hot without getting weird looks in public
i don’t like rushing
can't hear you
okay, but in game if mario doesn't touch a flag or axe every 500 seconds he dies
wanna bet rainy?
yeah, more or less
or are you talking about smash?
i don't even know what you are trying to say
but people can "progress" like, 3 bosses worth of gameplay in an hour or two if they move quickly so if you decide to build a nice home, suddenly, you're playing catch up or just being gifted gear upgrades
and the 3d games where there's a timer
i could probably still beat it though
what im trying to say is theyre not the most rational of people
i kind of need her alive
i mean, you can be my current one if you want
but somebody changed their name, lol
we never said that he was rational with this
what is my corpse supposed to turn into a furret?
i'll stream after i eat which is right now, bbl
i'm gonna say it's short for babylon
if i'm to be a furret i better learn surf and headbutt
but that's just me
i'll just turn you into my hm slave with cut only.
that's rude panda
well i never claimed to not be
like he's annoying me too, hence i proposed murdering him
oh it's not you
i just need to choke something
or be choked, i'm not picky
maybe 12?
well still, either way agitation falls under that category
and no 9k, i prefer the latter, but it's all about the participlants
the regular weebs or an actual raid
that's up to you though
out of curiosity
i should probably join stream but i'm listening to someone play jurassic park music on the french horn
why is my life so complicated
but french horns
i’m busy catching up on the youtube videos that i missed while at work. or maybe playing more red dead
a healthy dose of steel alloy a day keeps the doctor away
i looked up the simpsons rating
wait why isnt eyan streaming?
you're lucky you pay me a lot of money
told you to stream
shut up
before streaming
i would've been banned along time ago
he never finishes
odd technique but ok
if you don't the universe will explode
its okay theres more quality content to watch
babe
eyan
baby
lmfao
nice
for you rainy, i suppose i shall
give me two minutes
delet
stop
candy cease
delet you
gj guys
do i get to say a catchy one liner before the delet
mr stark
or every other person in both
or every fourth person in all four
wait
if candy gets to be thanos
honestly getting kicked in the vagina is pretty painful <:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
so you can call me daddy?
this is a very complicated family tree
that
yeah
scarlet witch
nice
how did i do that
wait
cause she's a bad bitch
and she dies
that parts important
did anyone get spanked by thanos?
i could join stream or i could go to sleep early again
!skram
i am happy af
if  you could follow my twitch that would be greatly appreciated 😄
we got like an eighth of an inch last night i hate it
just go to the arctic circle
sounds like a terrible design decision
is that like a handicap for "playing without normal metabolic process" or something
keep speaking like  tierzoo and im gonna flick your nose
pretty sure living on your own is adopting yourself
food for thought
actually just gonna start smacking your nose with a newspaper like a dog
higher damage but with some recoil if you're not wearing a glove
alright back to streaming
but fuck i'm cute when i put effort into how i look
my fucking roommate doesn't understand that his loud fucking movie that hes watching can be heard
people keep telling me i should play ff14
but that's limited in some ways
like you're not allowed to join a free company, add friends, do pvp or pass level 35
sounds good
this sounds complicated
tho buying the expansions after getting the base game doesn't extend that time
i should definitely give the trial version a go though, my mmo experience is limited to like a half hour of eso and most of that was me going "wow there are a lot of buttons i can press"
well ffxiv starts off with few buttons
your hotbars get overwhelmed
sigh
more storage devices
i was told
gonna stream sc2 so people can laugh at how badly i suck
whalecum
boop
bloop
and that's on top of all the backlog i had from last week, lol
well then.
this still feels weird
sometimes the classroom isn't the best place to learn
you're not wrong, i generally learned better off on my own, problem was, i'd just cream, lol
luckily my school was all right with that but i wasn't gonna worry about it either way
4 minutes into the new stephen & friends: gta online episode, and i'm already loving every second of it
i saw it earlier; it’s pretty good
listen mate thighs are god's gift to us and no one can convince me otherwise
why am i seeing ads for bras
why not
~~do you have interest in cross dressing?~~
maybe google is mocking me
screw you too google
(╯°д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \\)
y pose...
be like general grievous
follow his example.
or it just looks cool
going to take a wild guess that this is a "no"
i would gladly take a subreddit full of cat gifs right now
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
that’s what happens when eyan needs energy
sup bitches, your queen graces you with her presence
~~they are if you know they have a dick and you want them because of that~~
humor him
no like server powers, just like, people, and deleting them
skarm you're only three years old
case in point.
go for it.  😛
im not really in a bad mood it twas just a goof
hopefully it'll be smoother sailing from there.
who needs deleting?
ah yea, i think you'll be just fine though man youre friggin draco
and yea i can def relate. i mean im not in full on college, im only taking one course but it's intimidating as all hell
sounds good
mine are 8 weeks instead of 15 for examples.
look at you nerds and your...school
look at you nerd and your...job. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i’m getting ready to do nothing and relax until i gotta go work a closing shift
~~it’s not nice when i have to work~~
which is totally fine by me
true that
anxiety or something?
probably, draco
hmm.
welcome
what's a paladin
thinkingface
weeb
i will end the world
calm down war
fight fight fight
you have my word
heat up the blade first i wanna be branded
well now you're just being picky
way to stay optimistic
it's always been my dream to be killed by candy
candy do you own terraria?
gotta negotiate a place then too
10 paces
10 paces, not ten steps
and much as i want to die, i live to please
relatable
preach
terraria
verbal agreements are binding if either party starts to act on it
or enough
porque no los dos?
why tf
i puke it up shortly after
meat is great
beef is gross
so yeah
hmmm
rainy you home?
no rainy
they fucked a politician on twitch even though they get mad at cursing?
nobody is fucking hillary
hill[]
help
i need to make food
but what do i make
pasta
burg
i really need to get majoras mask 3d
depends on what would be on the burger but likely burger
i would prefer to have an american copy though
now 9k, you may ask me, did i just spend the last of my plat on being pink?
if you don't kill/die looking good, what's the point.
i miss her
also hai draco and xeon
this lesson doesnt look that long and it looks super interesting
if my view of the course is correct i'll be nearly 2 - 3 chapters ahead
is there like a clean version or something that seems like it would be a common kind of survey to make
they have most of high rock in it and it's pretty likely that that's where es6 is taking place
finally got around to deciding who i'm gonna put effort into in smash ultimate
shulk and marth are always gonna be my boys
i've been having a lot of fun with lucas
i just like palutena
and i've been on a metroid kick lately and ridley's actually good
can't really say for 4, because i didn't get the dlc for that one
i just enjoy the kit
pk flash/freeze - freeze looks cooler
pk fire - knockback on lucas, wall of fire on ness. personally prefer the knockback
pk thunder - lucas's goes through people
psi magnet - the one ability that i actually prefer on ness
also, full disclosure, i picked palutena because i like thighs
or in other words
plz dm it to me, thank you
top 10 photos taken seconds before disaster
uh ok
that won't help
youd think someone named angery boio would have a higher wrath rating
does it ever strike you how odd the naming of final fantasy x-2 is
nope
final fantasy 100
i can confirm this
super mario land 2 comes after super mario bros 3
oh u rite
also
when shulk says theyre eating people
what does that even mean
god fucking bless
bloodthirster also has +3 to both attack and damage rolls
4 times per turn
+9 to hit +11 to damage is still really good
what the hell are these queue times
somecallmejohnny finally noticed me
i redid it, this is me
the memes at gdq this year are fantastic
speedrunning marathon for charity
thanks
it's over now, but it's all on youtube now
i enjoy speedruns, particularly the mario and zelda ones
the only characters i can play are shulk and marth and marth, but without tippers
then you aren't really better at smash
so, rainy's evil, and she doesn't have laziness holding us back
we're screwed
it was never my intent to deceive
but gluttony counters pride, and sloth counters avarice, and those two sins are me summed up, so i've no time for the others
lol, literally just saw that tweet
pretty accurate
a lot of people we hate are the people we realize we have stuff in common with
(you remember kevin, right drago?)
the latter
and maybe
so i go to their channels
and go through their upload histories
night my dude, gl hf don't die
no u
everyone deserves a good night
you go outside and have a wonderful day this instant young man
kugal
you beautiful person you
y'all ever just stay up till 1 30 am and imagine yourself in a fantasy setting
thats right i said it
yea you'd want that huh
i wish you would talk here more because i like having you around
shoe's on the other foot now huh?
i've found this discourse immensely nice if we're gonna go there
look it's almost 1:30 in the morning go compliment someone else
will do
i should also head to bed
im probably gonna get points deducted for this
looks cool
interesting lol
i keep thinking about my weekly series idea, i really want to do it, lol
~~kingofskarmory.~~
pretty much
work isn't really supposed to be fun, lol
yeah but- dammit
lmaooo
would somebody who is flawless choose to be with a lesser being who isn't flawless?
pity
also good morning darling, and the rest of you lot
mind killing me?
i won't be dying for the next several thousand years, so i would prefer to spend less of it feeling lonely.
eh, details
i always feel like i scare people off when i'm here
my current setup is an scourge aasimar  fighter (gunslinger) level 6 and i'm planning on taking some levels in wizard for some illusion and defensive spells
hope you roll high
technically yes, but if you just want to send me something to listen to, no
ive been needing to record something since right after christmas, and it would probably take all of like five minutes, and ive kept putting it off, and suddenly my self-imposed due date is mid-afternoon on saturday and i still havent done anything
time to play skyrim... when i get home...
bring a laptop with you for low work days or when it's snowing
have you tried mountains?
out of curiosity pm
also, we're not understaffed, we just value actually working at work, sort of
glad someone else gets it
and why do you even _own_ that many pencils
he is still sitting there
i like how dragonite says nothing about the 3ds in that photo
sure
relevant
wait a minute i can just slap him in the face and be satisfied with that
5th gen is best gen
you think 5th gen is best gen?
yup, gen 5 is best
okay, but look her up on the internet
i mean, don't get me wrong, she, is hot
eh w/e
but the generation as a whole
nvm, you're good then
ok i have a better solution
cats are the solution
that too
cats
guns? are you playing the mtg version?
they should have made cynthia playable in dppt then gen 4 would have been objectively the best
it was an honest question
yeah so we just got up and left
currently replaying the original version of bowser's inside story
my kitty, ryu
katia, max
eyan dont _all_ of your exes have cats
3 if you count the stray that collette looked after for a while, but it wasn't her cat by any means
aren't you clocking out in like 4 mins

<:doit:334014889137930240>
its a win win
i'll go to war with it
funny meme
i'm sorry, is this the part where i should be laughing in amusement?
is that innuendo
hey did yall know that japanese honeybees kill hornets by enclosing them in a ball of bees and vibrating at a frequency so fast that it cooks the hornet to 115f/42c?
yeah, actually. probably from either wikipedia or watchmojo
i knew that some bees did that but not japanese honeybees exclusively

i work at wal-mart so i don't have a problem walking in there
you work at  walmart? my condolences...
it's not that bad honestly
the one i work at at least isn't that bad
i worked there for a while and the other people who worked there were literally the best part about it, which is not something the other places i've worked can say
where i work, most of my coworkers are good; it’s the customers and the repetitiveness of the job that get to me
i’d make a video talking about this, but i’d like to not raise the chance of me getting fired
there was one time where a family of about 10-12 mexicans came into the store just to use the bathroom. this also happened with an indian family, except they bought a cake
there was this one time around christmas that some lady tried buying like $1200 of clothes
and somehow the computer locked up and voided the whole thing
why would you try something like buying 1200 dollars worth of clothes in one go?
skarm has this way of being oddly relevant to the conversation
five
i would say same but i'm not here often enough
its like, revealed in the prologue
2 shots 1 cavity filled and 0 exams, fun day

lol fuck calc
civil engineering is a hellhole like no other
truss calculations are mega gay

i'm normal <:gwahreeweebrage:370265985787101187>
nomally doing math amirite
demon is that special type of normal where he's 'normal' with a bit of 'weird' but not too weird and must be protected at all costs
exactly
i'd pick the bible on that one
but raptors
i picked the first one
bella you need to be less normal
panda what the crap is that in your icon
likes cats is normal, college is almost too normal, going out on weekends is normal, having a shit job to pay for college is normal
it's gir
people in school
what is a virtue
who would the other two be?
i feel like some people here need some dopamine.
that would be dope...amine
i'm not sorry
that's so much better

be sure to not get a paper cut on your tongue
i'll have you know that i am a professional
that's not _their_ fault!
look, i wish i was created smarter, sexier, and maybe another inch or two taller, but i wasn't
there’s a lot of people around here who are 6 feet tall and around 5 feet tall with not much in between

i should sleep
are you sure it's not co?
but nah, it's just the battery

with my dying breath i cut the rope and exclaim "y'all fucking heathens gonna die in shame"
i object on the basis of context

i have sheets for mobile installed and it's about as fun as poking myself in the eye with a nuclear bomb that's in the middle of detonating

oh cool it even gave february the right number of days in a leap year

i download the spreadsheet and it's only 24 kb, but when i decompress it it's 140
good job zip algorithm (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
you should decompress some of mine
how big are they compressed (as xlsx)?
i guess you could save them as csv too
all the pages are in one xlsx
look on the brightside
although they should've honestly just gave it to retro in the first place
the extracted folder is 25.8 mb
were you just trying to break sheets or something

abandon ship and the degree
alternatively you dont have the drive to actually get shit done of in class deadlines
so i don't take his opinion into account too much
see most of us would say that gives us _more_ of an existential crisis
see: how i went from a d student to a b-a student
each of them have their respective advantages and disadvantages.
i think to some extent it also just depends on the person
im also an independent learned but i have a problem with stress and overthinking every little thing
for me it depends ont he subject
i need to do hands on brain surgery/analysis
oh, skarm~
oh shit he knows, he's not getting involved lmao
oh that highligher for ctrl f is quite the abomination upon the eyes
and it just starts working again
~~it is?~~
eyan you're awesome
it used webassign which i was scared at first because i've heard bad things about webassign, but it wasnt bad actually, and it accepted all of my answers perfectly which is nice
it took me nearly 2 hours to complete 21 problems, about an hour and a half i'd say, so that's a lot of work but it seems manageable
it's <1kb patch per game, which doesn't register as anything
welp, time to wait 6 hours for my game to update, i think the cold might somehow be affecting my internet
screw the horns
it's all about the macedonian horns
blame english, not me
that is entirely correct
epic
discussion posts that is
this is relevant
deathly cold today, supposed to be in the 20s to 40s for the rest of the week. yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
yooooo i finally solved a problem on my calc challenge problems which means im done finally...that took a few hours
but if you don't argue are you really learning? <:gwqlabsmmlol:398950702505918478>
i mean i don't really argue with my teachers and i learn <:kappa:374346980136058893>
hi demon lord ^w^
just trying to survive the cold lol
good job
math lol
oooh i wanna join
oh good
it sold 1.3 million in its first two months
maybe you, skarm?
just don't post the crashing gif and things should be fine, rainy.
look, eyan
well yes, if i wanted to just kill
i prefer the shorter and thinner ones for that
they have the light eerieness of needles
large knives, i've gotten that much figured out
precisely candy
hai friends ^w^
you can make your own fun in that situation
insubordination!
and only now just realized that i can buy art books
well not entirely but i'd only bought like five of them mostly out of boredom but still
i'd say that's about 1.35 cats for the price of one
what do you mean in drago's dream? eyan is so famous
i've got a new pet peeve
when anyone from my school asks me shit like "so what did we do this week in english?" because they skipped every class
like it's the end of week 4 and some rando student just asked me "so what are we doing?"
three magfests in a row
don't worry, he'll be going to the next one
let's make a correction, i did go in 2017, he just didn't see me there, lol
i missed 2017
you were at thrown controllers in 2018 though right? that means there was at least one point where i was at most 150 feet away from you and didnt see you
so thats fun
i can't believe you found the mud block
so my rabbit's been inside for the last few days because it's been way below freezing outside
what would i be reincarnated as
well math, not kugal
i was invited to the phi theta kappa society at my cc today and i know little to nothing about it but apparently it's becausse of all the maths i've done
ehhhhhhhhhhh
i could google it
i could also not google it
i should probably sleep
im such a proud parent
they basically just offer and encourage scholarships for the most part
plus im young and i think they have like an age limit on it probably
i should probably go shower, later folks
have fun
whenever i tell my friend im about to shower he says "stay safe, be smart, have fun, keep your eyes on the prize" and that is just too underrated
don't worry i just made a terrible joke
being a 2000s kid has it perks xd
maybe he's saying you go out and put your computer down
say godnight, skarm
or dont
night night skarm
i guess not
but then how would we get memes like 5 / 3 * 3 != 5
you know what i just realized? pretty much all languages that support casting floats to strings (so all of them) round the value
"road" is the most common road suffix
tried out that windirstat thing, and to the surprise of nobody
uhhh
at worlds end
that was a great choice to star him
ok so
i was watching the super bowl just like 99.9% of humanity,
im so out of the loop on avengers
they use dialog thats a little different and change the visuals so they arent spoilery
last movie i saw by marvel period was spider man homecoming
oh cool arrow dad gets to fight geologist dad in this one
>watching superbowl like 99.9% of humanity
fairly sure those numbers are bogus
~~i just said that~~
it gets less and less interesting in my opinion when one of the many teams in america always manages to play on super bowl sunday.
the game just boils down to the patriots vs. whoever's playing the patriots
its better if you think of it as whos playing the patriots instead of who is playing in the superbowl
according to cbs 103.4 million people watched the superbowl last year, which would make about 1.5% of everyone
by the way rc im 50+ hours into xenoblade and figured out what chain attacks do
something like that
well theres 7 billion people
so then 30 of .3 is like .09 which might as well be .1
everyone always knew that
i don’t think so
kugal why is there a d in fridge but no d in refrigerator
the fridge likes the d? <:kappapride:379352530863521792>
~~no, the individual. you d-nglehead~~
nice
i wonder when the next time i get like a day off is
if i decide not to take diff. equations and calc 3 at the same time, which should i take first
not at this cc
in a way, diff. equations is *kinda* a calc 4? except not really
just be sure to keep pace with your physics courses too
next week, not this week
then sometime after that is like trig-sub and partial fractions which i spent my whole winter break practicing so im not too worried on my performance on that
momentum, that shit was fun
parametric derivatives were simple enough, but something tells me parametric integration is gonna get messy
exactly
your weeks 1 and 2 are what we're doing right now
sure
also my paraoia is off the charts high
so i spent like 2 whole pages explaining everything in detail and showed every goddamn step
i understand sportsball now
kugal you are such a nerd
why am i not surprised at the result of the game?
just you sayin' that makes me curious
actually most of them were kind of meh
theyre not as bad as like english or something but like it's not code
twas fun
to anyone who knows touhou super well, wasn't there a song called "blinding new"?
why is it every time i need to do something on my computer, itunes always needs to update...
<:doit:334014889137930240>
i've never had beef dumplings *kugal said, surprising no one*
also, without listening to what i linked, i'm strongly guessing it to be based on either "a soul as red as a ground cherry" or "apparitions stalk the night"
those two songs are two of my more favorite touhou songs, that's why i know them and a lot of their remixes well.  probably just cause of nostalgia since that was more or less how i started playing touhou
for me, it's "mystic dream ~ snow or cherry petal" and "paradise ~ deep mountain".  thanks to you even.
one day i will
i'd like to get back to streaming skyrim this week
ive been living and dreaming about xenoblade for the last six days
impressive
my calc ii grade is at 105% so im like in heaven
well, i was talking more on the lines of mario 3.
that one was definitely better than the original
and i haven't even gotten to ice world yet as well
that's why i have the snes classic and my brother has the nes classic lol
maybe if i see an extra on the store shelves in the future, i'll get it and subsequently mod it to add tetris attack and more.
i thought they were already discontinued
oh yeah, i forgot they won't restock after the 2018 holiday season
i want something.
i want schools using memes.
music or drawing?
drawing
okay, somehow managed to get almost 13 seconds against piston hurricane on super punch-out
and yeah, the fan community is insane in what it has produced.
she'll be okay with it
reasons to marry me. gym membership, free medical, free dental, free life insurance, free house

karen took the kids like always
but it's really not worth giving that much of a shit about.
