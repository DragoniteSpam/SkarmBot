oh look it's after one in the morning and all ive done in the last hour is google "whats the point of 4chan"

my pre-calc-2 professor allowed us to have a 1 sided piece of paper for any formulas we could fit, and as much scratch paper as we wanted
physics is fun tho

i mean water can be synthesized as a product of cellular respiration and stuff
why is that even a question
i actually updated right after the update since it failed to install an update
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
twitter is the best social network there is, but that's like saying that
but i still think they need their own loveroms/emuparadise type of system instead of what they got for the nes games
if i wasn't so lazy i'd dig out the discord join/drop sound effects and then play them infinitely into my mic just to confuse you
flubs let's be honest
master are you compensating for something

anyways brb playing aatrox
because people use the definition of stupid so loosely, getting a fact wrong makes some people go from sir isaac newton to nemrod in some people's eyes
a massacre
should probably also farm derilect survival for octavia more
if you bend it far enough _everything_ can be an integral sign
because i was boosted and briefly thought guardian was aftershocik
i oddly enjoy looking at stuff i can‚Äôt buy and have no use for

whats the difference between a butt ton and a normal ton
i realize drago has beaten me in every social media
as per usual
oh you mean ripping off of r/writingprompts class
gonna go watchwestwing();}
or if you're behind the times, impact font.
would corrosive font be writing with acid?
i dont think this one has a right answer
everything's a library card if you bribe the librarian with enough
and when you die it stops being your problem
basically
that's what "formatting" means right
that was master's bad idea not mine

becoming school teacher is harder than it looks
i think the highest for freshman here is bio

i should probably tag him hun
ok enough of being a huge nurd, time to do dog chores brb again
you have no valid point
it‚Äôs not surprising, but official
because i do the dumb
it‚Äôs normal probably
was that because you didnt speak english or because you answered "musket" for every question

i thought it was unusually sane in here but i assumed that squid just left the window open again
here we see the dragonite taking a half hour to get out of bed as he continues to fiddle around with his metal spaghetti dinner from last year

hmm there's one section where one of the graybeards uses a gendered pronoun when talking about the player character, i wonder if they correctly change it if you play as a girl or if they just assume nobody would notice

rikara did not deserve to go play at worlds at any capacity
long term it may be a better move
they already knew they wouldn't have wom
im hearing aphro wanted meteos kicked and cody sun out
obviously rikara was playing in challenger series for one year and academy for most of this year
could make sense though
they could have let him one game since he worked all year to get them to worlds
well shit, how am i supposed to come up with that money?
you don't know that
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
i‚Äôm back from work ya ninnies. and eyan is streaming

<:doit:334014889137930240>

<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>

but i love ryan
he left his kid at the end so what? he's cool
depending on context, especially the dwight one
the office
because spoopy memes
im gonna do that next time
pffft haha
there is a 25% chance she will say no
since beef
with what sleeping? <:gwcentralpikalul:377110562116468766>
also that ^
jeez that box office is a lot
<:rooblank:399827527289536512>
he is lonely
i think usually do almond milk
weird, i can do that soon
and i usually take my coffee skim and 0-3 sugars depending on the day
panda, let's go get coffee
or like straight as an arrow
i start every morning with a triple mixed with milk and chocolate protein powder
mini√© rifle
post malone? <:roothink:399827523581771796>
but now i'm gonna make sure she thinks you're hideous
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
me neither (sorta)
i am gonna kill her tomorrow!
i am a hair person
on purpose
besides you can't hurt me rainy
i told her she is the best
i just said she has more than you.
bam roasted
it‚Äôs like what me and drago so
i wouldn‚Äôt know what to order. i should try that out
if you like white chocolate go with that
it‚Äôs fake
so what's the other option bella?
of what the literal differences were
cause thats the most common answer
what do i sound like? some attractive guy that all girls fall in love with?
next week boys next week....
real men play mario kart
okay well i blame flubs
wonderful, thank you
good enough for me, thanks guys
and i can‚Äôt say i want more from the game because tons of people will call me selfish or ungrateful and say i should be happy with what we already got. fucking stupid
how do you know that
a character from xenoblade if i'm not mistaken
yeah, i guess that‚Äôs a point
there you go
him too
worth it if it works
what did you say to you know who when you asked her out?
no problem
so i would say they were sweet?
its only two late when one or both people are dead
i wouldn‚Äôt care unless they were still dating someone
what else?
flubs
not an a hole
just have no self esteem
you mean my little one or ida?
there arent really more though
well good luck with that whole thing. personally ive given up on relationships because i suck at them
and upset
in my life time
although skyrim would technically be useful in that it would prevent me from eating any more candy and that's probably a good thing
i need someone to help me grocery shop
ahaha no
nobody goes to the arcade anymore
i'll buy wine
no offence ida i know you would
why is the library a choice?
so i would have to pick
just think in less than a year you'll be able to go to a bar
or what bella said
that is benny's date
farmers market it is
not mine
i lost my gba and my ds with the slot in the bottom
is there a stream right now?
i got rejected
true
tuesday no matter what
yes you can
i doubt even _he_ knows honestly
but can i ask when will king of zeal/superskarmory will be back recording for youtube again?
that kid who i blocked, his brother confronted me about it in the middle of class
skyrim
yay?
<:lul:305559915714576385>
>that sad moment when you realize you have a stronger connection with piranha plant with the games you've played over the characters in the fake banner/grinch leak since you haven't played those characters games
i'm not sure on how many stages we got with smash 4's dlc btw
"we got to have.... *moneyyyyyy*"
the german empire anthem is amazing
like why do you care, lol
bummer we didn't get smash run though, but oh well
the "not-so-great" maze.
hopefully there's not going to be another stupid great maze again
and then it turns into who cares about a boyfriend when you can get an a in calculus
yes its more chill than secunda, dragonite
like i said to that certain person i saw, he could always be dlc
i have my character predictions ready for the dlc
how many square tomatoes is it if each tomato is 3
nah, just felt like saying it
still gunning for elma and joker, though i have my doubts.
who probably got it from somewhere else
this isn't in any order btw
it probably wasn't important right
for the record i didn't invent you rang i got it from foxtrot who got it from the addams family
i could have invaded canada with all of my stupid high school videos
oh you know what it's private
i guess if you have steam 2fa enabled you should grab your phone too but only if you own skyrim
you said yeet like 6 years before it became common
and the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade and told of bold lies and the gold he had made
i actually dont really like the smb3 overworld
so greenland is on white witch time
the 90s were a mistake
also i played x in italian once even though i can only read like ten words of italian and was fine so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
anyways, i have nothing to do until stephen‚Äôs extra life stream starts in around 3 hours
and i tend to call myself a cat so that makes me a furry
destiny 2 is supposedly free until nov 18 but i cant find where tf the free version is downloadable
i loved playing as them
good maybe i should not give a shit more often
-----.----
...----...¬∑-¬∑-¬∑---.......------..---
yeah
you know what better than that
see if the achievements were no hit a boss or complete the game at sl1 thatd be fun
poor paris
like i just dont enjoy the action of eating
..-...-...--......--
as much as i would love to see everything go down, i have work tomorrow afternoon
peggy still arives
run from it
dread it
aint nobody cooler than this dan
are they nice?
be a shut in neet who hasnt seen the sun in two years
sleeping doesnt make me less tired
amazing island is *already* back in fifth
i woke up at 9 today and really wasn‚Äôt into it
1 am
yeet
maybe ida
i do indeed
you get used to it.
interesting
it's also a secret excuse to eat hamburgers all weekend because all of the other food in the area is either expensive or trash but dont tell my mom i said that
he has hair like you
drink alone in sadness and cryu
i give you my presence
it's like 1974
i think you're a bit too concerned about the layout but if it makes you happy and gives ya something to do, go for it
i spent 1 hours before i fell asleep watching musket videos
freedom it is
wait stream is on now?
only convention i know what i want to go to
when going to nyc we do usually stop at albany overnight to visit friends tho
you should probably do that too
demand your money back
these are quite obviously shrute bucks
"let me make my *entire fucking life* public
guess i'm going to hell (the piece is called the gates of hell btw) lol xd
drive into pillars, is a good insult
well i need a script writer
also writing is hard \
that concerns me slightly less than mr. joe on street street knowing everything about my daily life
flubs, you need to react to more than just the c
was a very interesting car ride.
dont google that
i dont have his phone number
how dare she say that
you're allowed to run around it if you can't kill it somehow
you tripped over a mouse?
brb class
well i need a lawyer and my sis is the only one that knows how to do this law thing from those ace games she played
well yes. but sometimes we don't like fractions and prefer decimals
do you want a wall of 3's, flubs?
but with the question of dec100/dec3
i kinda wanna hear the story behind that
hex superior
i have it
tomorrow i meet up with the girl who rejected me
also its not loadi g for me
twitch is broken for me
i regret going down this road
not the "no one noticing for 30+ years" but
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
oh wow
also i used a random follower for the boethiah quest and now i feel terrible
second on the list is annoy drago
the disadvantage of a morning class: i really want to get the thing we need to do today done already
thats on them
i don't do that unless asked
lmao
i only hug people i like
only if you take them according to prescription
i sold my civic duty for drugs
im lonely
i know
so it's even
okay, because 100%ing mm is not as bad people say it is, and you're also on the remake and not the original
<:lul:305559915714576385>
because video game movies are famous for being well-made and successful
and then give it all to me because it was my idea
they're your friends
wait how can the big man move
not do oot: master quest blind, probably
thank you person who said that
i gotta wait 20 minutes for the bus
well
anyone here?
....
is there any actual use for a function whose order is 29
i forget what the other name for the biggest exponent is
fiddlesticks
first thing in mind that i think when math is said is calculus
is that my cue to spend the next four hours writing code for things other than classwork or
what‚Äôs wrong with breakfast
things it doesnt do right: 68,7634,541
but that method is gold
okay the last time i ate breakfast voyager 2 had officially left the solar system, but only just barely
things it does right: 1
the "getting up before 10:30" part
maybe 4th
i wonder if i can launch both the special edition and the regular edition
yeet
it is bad
earth prolly
im a kaiser
get it out of my head!!
flubs we should hang out sometime
after that it's less fun
welcome!
and somehow he likes me
most shit post admin would be...yeah prob master
you don't remember when we first met
i don't..
im still grossed out by that movie
i do
no you're not
do you play nerdy board games?
i have a heart with someone on snapchat
yep!
sorry ida but i can't take orders well or do something i don't wanna do
i would have destroyed everything
i like war but usually when i am here i think about it more
to be honest
someone lemme know if thats too harsh, i'm legit not sure
this server is not nearly as mentally taxing as some others i'm on
great now i just know my mind is as bad as eyans thanks
no drago
and one of them threatens to punch me
ida i need protection
you were here yesterday though
who has heard of the war of 1812?
werent there two of them
thank god since i hate kisd
we are gonna do that
even the rejection ones

has nintendo given up on qa or something
theres some things i want to catch in the pok√©walker but it requires me to get a lot of exercise and i dont feel like walking the dog or going a bunch of circles in the kitchen
i'm leafleaf
nest
we've talked about this before
i don't remember but it might be
<a:atpc_jumpcited:485160985028460546>
change your nickname then
thank you.
this let's play stuff i will only work on
hey ida when are we gonna hang out again?
hey, wanna watch lion king 2?
i gotta get through that
hey heard about that new undertale prequel game?
sorry
and flubs
not the first game
didn't know who it was so i rejected the request
wowee
but back then it was absolute horseshit and no one wanted to pay $60 + a monthly subscription for a shittier version of wow
usually just end up getting 50 in one handed and giving up and go full warrior
because i'm terrified
and probalby even more that ive never heard of
two handed or some sorta conjurer is what im leaning toward rn
hmmmmm
jeez how many ffs are there now
still the same thing in oblivion
i‚Äôm very curious to know why some guy has a cut out of what i think is ash‚Äôs hat strapped onto his forehead
i have 108 as my iq
but you could conjure armor along with that
i dont like playing as an archer
lab mates and i today picked up beans with different items in the name of science.
why were there germans in hong kong
i haven't had cereal in years though
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
don't
95% chance
hi person
you rang
i'm not responsible for hurricanes, power outages, comcast, and acts of god
~~screw family~~
should i play skyrim
that is fair
i have downloaded a dating app
i can see how outdoor pictures would be more appealing to people
would have love to see how that would turn out
this is too hard
mapquest is not a dating app
but i have a rarity beach pic when i pretend to be rarity
thanks i've been up for 3 days
two in the morning is nothing
active?
i could pet your dog for you while you're away doing redacted
shes been dead for like a billion years so yeah the new old people who live there would probably be confused
high
uh huh...
hi dead i‚Äôm squid
he did
im about to do the craziest thing ever
it's what i'm about to listen to
doesn't matter
for once i thought about it
did it involve beans
imma do it
my way is better
greetings and salutations, dan! welcome to the kingdom of zeal!
this is one of the rare times i use the mlp way
flubs i did something stupid after you left
drugs?
i mean uh welcome
someone doesnt understand how fast explosions are
also believe in your king
<:rooderp:399827526744014848>
there we go
how do i do the tm thing?
just be like me and make all your videos terrible <:kappa:374346980136058893>
but it's _almost as if the author has never installed an mmo before!_
but you didn't let him get ahead
you don't have to pay me i just want to pet dogs
who even knows
it is right now
someone tell daylights savings to stop so i don‚Äôt want to sleep at 5 k thanks
like before daylight savings id feel like i was gonna get axe murdered on my way to work but now i dont
dark at 5? weak
you can't threaten me
i wanted to do something similar in wearing a costume the day after halloween

quiet keyboards are nice
his daughter confirmed he is dead
stan lee is dead.....
i really want to play rdr2

today i learn you can make ice
history lecture pls
i can make a math/history vid
im listening to music on it just fine
bam assignment done
i'll get back to you in a few days
thats sucky rc
2. enough flour
dont rush yourself kugal
that sounds like peripheral abuse
fancy that
panda might know
is stream potato or is it on me
i‚Äôll take the silence as a yes
im not drunk im flubs
yes samsung made it
okay, ,the show more input i guess broke
good to know it's still functional i gu‚Äînever mind
what‚Äôs eyan streaming? xcom again?
no he is not
yeah youre definitely up late
that sounds like vampirism but worse
but yet you want me?
i am suspicious
the amount of dog pets that must happen per second is greater than the amount of seconds that happen per second
yeah
dont say that to her please
sooo yeah
im trying my best to assist
wait
i need that medicine
always wanted to experience a life of a soldier in the 18th century
i had fun there
top ten smartest human beings who broke the system
people are always angry there
but you seem to enjoy life
i like dogs
tbh most of the reason i dont stew in a pot of self hatred and loathing is because id be justified to and people wouldnt really be surprised
though flubs happens to not get under my skin at all...
cats aren‚Äôt that bad as i originally thought
like i only dont at this point because i didnt before
im going to the hair salon
actually looks great...
we've proved that ‚àö2 is irrational, we've proved that the number goes on forever, isnt that cool?
ida wanna cut my hair?
you'd think that would be impossible
and thats what makes it so not absurd
i know, but that just gives me a few basic ideas
i like science and math though! d:
which is why youre frigging weird
idk maybe the higher level shit is cool but i never did any of that
ok mr 100%
if they dont get high state test scores then some bad shit happens to the shcool or whatever
which leads me to think about war the most when i am here...
you're just gonna buy new ones aren't you
but now it's like the complete opposite
im currently in intro to stat and calc 1
done with my phone call
dinosaurs are fucking awesome
not for me though üò¶
here ill teach you about dinos instead
then fuck em
theyre fuckin awesome
make them feel useless
bully them back
bully them back
i could win a world record for how stupidly redundant i can be
why is it not alive
did someone say steak
butter on cookies?
weird right
no theyre like so vanilla that they dont even contain vanilla
yes they have animals with names like kangaroo and wallaby and blue-ringed octopus
is having a good time with your father a bad thing?
fuck
the answer is yes
im getting flash backs to poems some girls in my highschool wrote
probably
this "3d rendering system" thing is haaaaaaaaaard
not anymore
"shut up my sentret needs the exercise"
i fixed my mouse btw
my calc 1 midterm was stressful enough lol
i broke it with a hammer and fixed it with a hammer
poetry for fun is really pleasant
i also considered microwave oven and motorized can opener
is 70 kg a lot and is 20 m/s a lot
not with that attitude
155 pounds is a lot tho
maybe i should just take it up to the roof of the english building and drop it
will the livestream be live until 11‚Äôish?
imma become an artist
i held!
oh, eyan‚Äôs streaming
hey ida civ 6 next?
i was one of those until i wasnt
but i held on
i really should probably go home but the other people are being so weird it's hard to resist wasting time to see what airhead things they do next
climate change sure is good aint it
and not july
can‚Äôt i just create a goddamn palindrome
but then you would need shirts with three sleeves
well flubs they usually flow downhill
well
if you know something is a dumb idea
this will be the stupidest thing i ever do
nah cuz if i did that i couldnt get on to the night terrors as quickly
first off, mood
rit is not a state university
and i just made up some 9 year olds new gamertag
i like using 489 in names because its very witty and im quite smart
pretty sure that's tje gamertag of a kid on my bus
dude being sad about the future is next level
as i say
dont enter rem
this one
"opportunity"
i'm falling asleep from boredom at the same time
i'm in a permanent cycle of mad and sad
is it pronounced eye-er or err? who the fuck knows
is hampshire not pronounced with the shur part
that‚Äôs the only way i‚Äôve ever said it
i want to pet my dog
black cats always win
but she's sleeping in dad's room and i dont want to wake up dad just to pet my dog
not a courtroom
unnecessary
why on earth would you want your code to execute _slower_
i remember begging my mom until we got one xd
demon lord you should upgrade to a dog
you know what pronunciation makes no sense what so ever
on the other, what kinda shitty ass parent would disapprove of a class that helps their kid be healthier and more active
i can love both
but nowadays cats are easier for me to take care of
i tend not to like the kids who play it
1% chance to get her back
he's of contrary opinions
it just still feels way too early for this area's snow season. and it's not supposed to be winter yet
fuck i should be sleeping
bella i'm kidnapping you and forcing you to live in the temperate part of the country so you can suffer with the rest of us.
no im lazy
and its got mountains
if it's about me
this, a song of sons and daughters
dab drago
college girl and i talk a bit more lately on snapchat
hmmm
the bear thing killed me
once you know what verbs and prepositions are english is pretty ehhhhhhh
shall we watch again?
you‚Äôre fat
how much do i have to pay you to use that?
again
well tbh i don't know either
hey ida would you punch me in the face if i started shipping you with rainy
he got the wrong target.
i just go with w/e
you should use my node script to generate random usually-pronounceable character strings
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
rainy's cute, i don't mind
hey drago
i dont wanna scroll whats up
transgender*?
so ask someone else
my mistake
you already have a stockpile
best friends would be ida, flubs, stormy, and breana
today a prof told me to make a medicine wheel
haha what a fuckin loser. being mentally stable sometimes. what a nerd
civil war...you are talking to a friendship and war general
but im like bi polar
a trans?
i love queer circles
this is just kingdom of introverted ninnies: 1 vs. 100
i forgot it
i will individually break each and every one of your knuckles
ditto with ida and master
that was suppose to be an insult
i am genuinely happy that they see me like a younger brother
in that case do i have you guys' permission to change his name to "drago's toast"
clyde
that would be awesome
and when the truth finally dawns
this is fun
i‚Äôll take your silence as ‚Äúyes‚Äù
here is a good joke
if i have it i guess
and regardless of your actual intelligence
just kinda...roll right out onto the floor
same, rainy
where did you leave it for that to happen
mood
i think it's that they look at the game with the highest accumulated review score
it happened before i lost it i went to class in the rain a bunch of times
kingdom of introverted ninnies: civil war
good job
weird
i like beef
thanks i think i was happier not thinking about that
oh okay
even if i wouldnt like them under any other circumstances
would there be a challenge run for pok√©mon or/as
same thing with my dad actually, you would think at first he's the nicest guy on the planet, but when you start to spend time with him, that's when things start to go downhill
was a much needed visit because it definitely distracted me from ym stress and stuff and i was feeling lonely as shit this week
personal favorite kind is the one where it only gets funnier and funnier and you  can‚Äôt stop laughing, and you try to stop, making it funnier
i like trolling hardcore here
it‚Äôs always good to get out for a while
i can‚Äôt math rn. it‚Äôs ok lol
never played either. both look ok to me
me: gets up, sees that it's just after 9 am
yes flubs you can once i am done with it
that was the plan
guys
though pls don't upload nsfw
there's your score
flubs say something funny
i wanna pick a fight with this blade lord person
math bad
i wanna hear little dratini stories
you should pick a fight with like a bumble bee or something
ida wanna talk about pie or something
pogi was the leader
i was very close to one though
i can't forgive that
also like what do they matter at all
its just an example of when sending someone to prison is ok
i mean getting someone sent to prison ruins their life but if they murdered your parents it prolly justified
that's only three hours are you okay
but resetting every time you accidentally blow lydia off a mountain is annoying
so skyrim stream it is when i have time
so you _did_ beat the tutorial bear
gonna teach drago
why do you own all the dlc if you gave up ten seconds into the base game
oh hey digging through my pics
so don't watch that
but dont 100% it because the dunwall city trials are fucking horrible
which are basically semiannual two-week black fridays
i did once
okay new plan let me dig around
that's like their whole shtick
fair enough
ssds have gotten cheaper
well if you're ever looking for more harddrive space i think i saw a 1tb ssd somewhere for like $130~140
every day is black friday with newegg
did you hear someone got sued by nintendo for running a rom site>
***hey dragonite did you hear your baby cousin won an award for marching band and was named ceo of earth, incorporated and has a girlfriend*** and by the way are you still like alive and stuff?
youtube just shitted itself again
hi angry i'm etinogard
and ive been trying to get out of those for _decades_
ewwww
black bear
what show
> math
okay, his favorite food is the fingers of people who aren't as smart as they think they are
and you love the fat guy
i am angry
squid arent you boneless though
ida if you don't know what those are you probably dont want to look it up
(‚óï Œµ ‚óï)
problem is
all of it
wasps. oh wait, that's deadlier
do you have like an atom bomb i can borrow
crap i was in need of a filled soul gem
also creator studio bullshit is dumb
~~chicken breasts or real ones?~~ <:kappapride:379352530863521792>
tarantulas can be pets
that should probably tell you something
i got fired after
actually i expected something worse
i could probably find a better one pretty easilyi though tbh
ping me if you set up a game
apparently it came back
flubs we need an anthem after this
hey theres a statue of satan in a public square in kansas or something because of the confederation
didnt you only break up like three days ago
drago you are greedy
worse.
i hate film
oh damn i'm late i could've subbed in for drago on data structures
10,800 seconds until fantastic beasts
without a controller
im not
false: it‚Äôs a 51% chance
only skyrim, fo4 and 76 so far run on creation
well i dont like having a beard and facial hair because it's more trouble than it's worth
i'm surprised so many people want warrior.
flubs
but that one wasnt fromt he beginning i thought
so, uh, i wouldn't count on it anytime soon
there‚Äôs a lot more info about it than o ever realized
you played mage
just play better 4head
my recomendation would be awakening since its my favorite and its the one i started with
i'm honestly not that interested in slay the spire
i kind of wanna play 100% orange juice
good choice
i just woke up from an exhaustion nap, hi eyan
i'm down to  play
i'm bored and kind of want to play some multiplayer....
hey eyan, is it still possible we might see you play fire emblem?
they all left me
wheres my money then
yup but the plan this time was to fix it
blind luck
that might take a week
password?
more
can someone kill me
i'm going to leave it that way until march
no i just send death threats to it whenever it pms me about shit
thats the 26
charizard
linked in
i dont wanna get the thing tho
we are all terrible. we are the hive.
nonsense it's just soda poured on your hamburger so you dont have to eat them separately
round 2 rn
good lord squid
also did the rules change? i appear to be getting the cards that i play but are not selected returned to me
the linkedin thing has a bunch of tags you can search by
it was the card i drew that turn
god bless rngesus
about 33% chance of this being the last round
oh my god
all i have so far
somebody
does this black card not even matter to y'all?
nobody cares about grammar
him and panda were both at 7/8
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)

true
not a single expression
its great
just a couple times every update
kugal are you a fan of modulo division
me: ok it's midnight i should go sleep
from scratch
once a _month?_
he got paid for it too
i don't think we have one of those nearby in corn central
not dead
well, ,i missed the last sat test for this year. so at this rate, i'm not going to be able to apply for college next year
i havent played a pokemon game for years ):
in other news it turns out that telling a computer to figure out if two angles are close-ish to each other is _ass_
so you pay to have a chance to pay to go to college
darn, i wanna play games rn
just dont take the tests
societal pressure, higher-paying jobs, dream jobs/careers, etc.. take your pick
fair enough, rc.
‚Äúwhat killed the dinosaurs? the ice age!‚Äù
and liberty and the pursuit of happiness
the physics gnomes went on strike so gravity on venus is whatever it wants to be
wait
well we're not taking the atmosphere into consideration
its not dependent on if its a planet or not
different acceleration due to gravity
everything that exists that has mass has a force of gravity
so the moon isnt a planet because it doesnt orbit the sun, and pluto isnt a planet because its too small
why arent stars in solar systems with two stars planets
that‚Äôs what kids do: repeat the same shit a million times until someone yells at them
i'll just need a death star-sized bag that's all
first, they got to deal with the hundreds of thousands of people saying how terrible fallout 76 is
theres nothing on yt i want to watch. send help
hmmm
oh my god, ,the score for the ps4 version...
big yes
keep in mind i was like 8 lmao
hey hey just because i wanted a tyrannosaurus as a pet at one poitn in my life means it's okay for _everyone_ to do taht
ew rom hacks
alright so i have to make a decision today. do i just eat turkey cold cuts with instant gravy on top or do i make myself an entire turkey and eat the same thing for a month
one channel i've gotten into the last few days is mother's basement
three tiles
aight well ive got 50 minutes so ill go start now

whatever that means
:boxthinking:
just not happy
dammit
i think the last one has a story behind it
i'm definitely creating enemies with the let's go base atm
speaking of pokemon tho
but i hate to completely toss away ss completely.  i think the best way to handle those comments is to just prove them wrong this time
i almost did that once fortunately the imposter site was trash and looked nothing like what the actual site looked like and i figured it out pretty quickly
~~now why would you accuse twitch grandpa of something like that?~~
speaking of bad man, some people in their patreon server might send stephen a shirt with ‚Äúbadman‚Äù on it. and mal is in on it üòõ
makes sense to me.
lemme check
you take away my modship so you can kick me off the team
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
i don't want emotions antymore
bella what i havent eaten breakfast since 2014
nier automata is 50% off
not anymore
just find out how messy her house is and make yours messy to the same degree and she won't notice
i just remembered today is when we get stuffing.
i opened skype the other day and my eyes threw up
when is later?
so all of the things that i'm probably going to be awful at
so prepare for reading
~~so you‚Äôre a hoarder?~~
i ain‚Äôt doing good at understandin‚Äô your language
he'll never make it past that step
im not a pony
though always wanted to be a girl for a day
oh flubs great news i got a new right hand man
i think i will teach him how to be like me
yeah but i get to eat at dinner time not lunch time
he wont?
makes sense to me
now i look as superior as i am
unfortunately you
where is my invitation?
what did i juat walk in on
what about your pink?
cousins annoy drago
yeah not a fan personally
that is a combination of red and less red
role red
god no
you do that while i make my new anthem
i hate it
and put them all in the same room
yeah that ones integration assigned, ida
yeah thanksgiving in canada is not what it is down there
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
i threw so many tantrums yet always get something or someone i wanted
neither are as easy as that
wow narcissistic much
flubs what should i buy tomorrow?
im thankful for ponies, my pony friends, war, and muskets
ehh she spelled cornucopia correctly so its ok
if you dont need goggles normally you arent cooking right
black friday
easy
lol ida
or your skin
but one of them went home and there is now 33% less dog in the building
some people give me a weird look when i do it irl since they can hear me whisper it
bc im gonna put a hat on one but im not sure which yet
the closest one is string cheese dan
i keep hearing word about it, is it worth watching?
dan?
but he is not awake as the same time as me
both
i saw it already, dragonite
i dont mind turkey, its good, but i looked at what we're having and it looks 10 times better
stuffing indeed
stuffing? what is it?
stuffing is life
kugal youve only eaten like 3 foods shut
there we go
then i remembered you're canadian
mr food expert
mr food expert
i should probably drag my right hand man here for protection
thats a nice way to put it majestic haha
help i want more pie
alright lets make this easy for you then
do i want to know?
fourth of july is only american in name
happy capitalism.day
we shouldnt have months and just have 365.241 days every year
rainy i'm going to force you to re-watch the movie over and over until you change your mind
functional 9/10
duck
indeed. welcome.
well he doesn't seem to mind
what's it on?
the last lesson was on hypothesis testing between two samples, both independent and paried
your course was pretty damn fast. we're only gonna get to integrals this monday
but i couldn't do it last night because mystatlab was under maintenance
just break webassign until he gives up using it
hey were always blue for me
that‚Äôs some dark stuff lol
your face is infinity
yeah what i said is infinity but in math form
there will be a good amount of limit questions
how much mass in kilograms remains in your leftovers?
and be stuck with my great-aunt?
fair point.
i made libre office pissed at me with a 3gb ram sheet
pretty much all of the reviews on all of the final fantasy games on steam say one of two things
thanks
that's actually pretty rare
some professors make you memorize them and suffer
do it for the tense pre-presentation college students
annotations were the big boxes?
youre right they did it because it doesnt work on the devices that account for more than half of all playbacks, _and_ most of the others don't use them
annotations were ass
just check the comments of the wooly world videos
welp, guess emile's comment sections now will be flooded with chuggaaconroy cultists. not sure how i feel about that
i think it's just average
curse mobile and making it hard to show that
how the heck is 100 average
in essence, today is a mess?
also i got a confirmation email saying im enrolled in calc ii, so thats neato. now i just gotta take my calc i final and kick butt and do my best and then i'll be on the road to more math lol
no one knows why
as far as i can tell
cause that's hilarious
i definitely do because im an idiot but for fucks sake just move the scale to a better place
but does a 0 baseline not make more sense than a 100 baseline
its stupid where it is. keep everything the same, just move everyones iq down by 100
intelligence quotient
so it's impossible to get negative numbers
bollocks im not green anymore
it makes me happy that two-year-old me is on average smarter than now-me
well, at a certain point it starts to decrease
do you mean _your_ arms dont functionas swords
gotta make an email that wont be taken but will be looked at without being assumed to be spam
making throwaway emails is hard
nothin much whats up with you
wow. ive never applied to schools before and it‚Äôs kinda very scary
alright so i finally came back to my third run on emerald
not trying to one up the suffering contest
i mean that'd be kinda cool now would it
i‚Äôve used all of those except for delphox
also no greninja & charizard this time
delphox is the one with a wand or something right?
even then i haven‚Äôt played either in a really long time
they use it?
im thankful for flubs
yeah, i still think the sequels in gen 5 are better than the originals
the general opinion in the pok√©mon fan base that i strongly disagree with is that gen 5 is the best and gen 4 is the worst
the final boss was better
ehh, i either loved or hated the changes (or lack of change)
this is almost the exact same fight as we had recently
if did not go well.
some people were annoyed with the changes to lusamine also
but that doesn't mean i will like it as a final boss
~~i think you mean climax boss~~
and i haven‚Äôt bought a pok√©mon game in years
i thought the story in sun and moon was better than black and white. i just can‚Äôt be with everyone calling that the best story
also it was already confirmed that the 8th gen games will have a different engine to let's go and that they will be the best looking games in the series so far
and with the let‚Äôs go games selling 3 million copies fast, i think it‚Äôs safe to say we will be seeing more let‚Äôs go games
i am convinced that they just look sun and moons engine and made let's go in hd
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i don‚Äôt really like saying communities are toxic, because every single one has its terrible fans, but yeah, some parts of the pok√©mon fandom are awful
let‚Äôs go looked more like x&y in hd to me
irrelevent
anything popular, labelled toxic. even when it's a relatively great community
also to be fair
i was also so tempted to make azumarill a temporary team member yet again and choose crawdaunt instead
-rideable pokemon
-following pokemon
because he's like perpetually drunk and that would explain a lot
btw were the motion controls a turn off for you also squid
brb getting food
are you comparing roman nanotechnology to bird doo
greek seems to have stuck the most, but it certainly spread tech progress across the isolated nations a solid amount
truly too ahead of their time
we can map out the entire chicken genome, put it onto a computer, then broadcast that via wifi which is really radio which is really electromagnetic radiation. thus you can radio people chicken shit
algettu has been revitalized
honestly the last half hour of talk in here is what enhasa should be like
i wonder if youtube api allows you to get a list of discord users from those that join a channel
darn
oh well maybe we just havent advanced far enough as a society to make use of inte or polo
here let me get the sum
master you do it for me im tired
probably
is that not what you entered
lucius appuleius saturninus, a tribune, passes a law to redistribute land to military veterans. the law requires that all senators swear to abide by it. quintus caecilus metellus numidicus refuses and is exiled. he goes to rhodes to study philosophy.
even if ya did then it still shouldnt be that high of a number lol
i dont have a good word for it but its too round i guess
i need a nice corner couch to work on
fun prank
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
this is about the purity test, isn't it?
and what is the score of 15 from? the roman thing?
you *must* know what that is
you have to play a game to give a score
i've got to work morning concessions tomorrow. because we need basketball games in like 9 in the fucking morning, an elementary game at that
is it me drago?
like why do i need to justify everything with this guy lmao
radio silence speaks volumes
you can say it
didn't help also that it took forever to get the nature and ability i wanted for my azurill also which needed to be happy to evolve, so that was fun with all of that walking xp
i prefer not being arrested
only after accepting your low lewdness stat can you grow it
rainy i hate to say this
let's try and get eyan in, it's friday
(ssh, not here, rainy)
(maybe later)
you underestimate how dumb i am
i have one semester's experience with uni compsci
(‚ó°‚Äø‚ó°‚úø)
that‚Äôs how i am right now
squid stop hating things
shut up it's owls
also buh bye ida
is it a coincidence that deci just came online or are you two planning on league?
hooray time for another round of me putting off contacting any of you until sunday afternoon when everyone's packing up
i look wonderfully grumpy, thank you
you think that's bad? i'm just gonna drive 24 hours and kick in their room door
how do you say "cheese" in dovahzul
i‚Äôm already argonian
super nerd army
i hope so
also i can also confirm that the friends suck ass in this game
who remembers when memes had effort put into them
also what happened to not worrying about details and "fuck it just do it" in regards to youtube?
what the crap twitch
no its just old fashioned
what else was there
perfect
alll valid abbreviations in modern language
iv unit, extra large, liquid crystal display, direct message
ive counted to 4 in binary on my fingers a few times
also doesnt matter if you use thumb or pinky as 2^0
dont have time to wonder into the  endless vastness of space
weird til "our" and "your" are only off by one letter
good for compression i guess
is it gilgamesh?
my mom would break physics
here's a gilgamesh one.
what happens if it gets full
was recording something today and something catastrophic almost happened
yeah but it's about eleven characters too long
~~name a dratini after me~~
greekid
hubble, galileo, brahe, kepler, etc
think about it dragonite, going to go eat, get back to me later when i stream
all of them, but sceptile probably won't get much use
we're live by the way
i wish
that aloix guy is a fucking loser
tomorrow is black friday so i gotta go to best buy
til boxbox watches chugga
is that going on right now?
the teacher is talking about fishing with a guy who isn't in the class
very mooooving
i don't have much left and i'm going completely from memory because i'm at work
but they won't get much use so i was thinking of giving them to my not so active but big time past donators
first come, first serve.  makes sense for this sort of thing.
not really a "story" per se, but you were the first person i watch on youtube ever and for the first few months, the only person i watched.
now that's a good story.  üòõ
well you don't actively make videos right now. üòú
i'm sort of in a similar position, only with college instead of work.
i'm worried that nobody will care, the world has changed around me quite a bit, but from a youtube perspective, i'm still the same old derpy kid who just wants to screw around with videos
i appreciate that.  right now, i think support is all i need
i can only beat most of them on normal.  i have beaten a few extra stages and hard runs on the easier games though
i'd be lying if i said i didn't have a lot of fears about it though
it seems like a huge liability, lol
rainy, you are one of the most important people in my life
i couldn't sleep right now anyways
i avoid it like the plague
i will admit though, i'm surprised how chatting with you guys isn't actually hurting my productivity that much
yup, i do it all the time in the kitchen, knife in one hand, phone in the other
yo eyan, ping me wherever if you want, i'm get a tiny bit more sleep
yeah eyan, i'll cover for you, i'm off, go grab a nap
plenty of sleep time
that sounds dreadful
the end
somebody
hey nerds
tis a good story
bella!
no thanks
50 sounds good when you‚Äôre stuck in the 30s all winter
i couldn't live somewhere where 50 was considered freezing cold
i'd rather move north if i had to go anywhere
i said special twice
it sounds lewd
it's been a rough week.  >_<
oh god, that's terrible
it's at least good that you're venting, though
besides, i'm not stupid, i'll be in a call with friends to watch over me.
oh you‚Äôre working right now? didn‚Äôt know that
eyan, outta curiosity, do you see a therapist?
so, to answer the question, some days it can be my entire shift, other days, not as much.  i'm "accounts payable" though so my job is pretty much just to pay bills
that‚Äôs special
learn to drive
understood
i have a bad habit of finding an excuse to not see one
how long does that take? like, does that take your whole shift or just most of it?
so that was neat
i can‚Äôt imagine one side of the county to another
so now i take the bus
since she knew exactly what i was going through
i know it's not the brad i know, lol
why not fly if you have to drive 7 hours?
i usually stop at a denny's in middle of nowhere wyoming
oh no eyan is dead
driving is fun for a while
wow, way to assume and talk about me like i'm not here
i'm a capitalist at heart
and i'm sure she wouldn't mind paying interest anyways
i try my best
you‚Äôre not a compl
you bastard
you aren't wrong
it‚Äôs stupid
i‚Äôm not allowed to do anything around here
also
yeah
i demand that somebody tell me a story
kinky
i demand the story of ragnar the red stop
i want an original story
too many scales for me
there once was a hero named ragnar the red
impressive
i thought at least jake would be in it
also nice unintentional double entendre
well they arent that popular and have caused a lot of problems for youtube
i'm a grinch, who needs santa hats
jake was in it; at least the last couple of episodes
she is a cat
the cat _is_ the maid
and my body
didnt she fucking murder subaru though eyan
like i know it was a misunderstanding but she still murdered him pretty hard
i could be like the butler who always falls asleep and plays ds games on the job or something
i'll pay for all of your needed maid expenses
beacon of feminism as i am, i've always wanted to be a maid
i can cook and clean like a goddess
and how tall is ida?  lol
i like maids
of course to keep it in proportion youd have to remove the forearms and the middle of the torso
so maybe rem is more apt
yeah but i could‚Äôve been like... 5‚Äô10
just means you can attack the abdomen easier
my cousins have giants for parents so they‚Äôre all tall and it‚Äôs annoying
now we need a disappointed head butler. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
he's the butler
hey 9k
rainy had a soul? this is news to me
cats
not anymore
you ca be the daedric prince of cats
indeed
that's molag bal's domain
love made with  pizza sounds mediocre at best
that's an odd form of precipitation
i get the feeling you secretly want to actually be my maid, lol
just roll with it
public class lower{
i never said i disliked ass, just i'm more of a boobs guy, lol
good job
\*and he was never heard from again\*
did ya guys see youtube rewind 2018 came out today lol
i used to watch his stuff as well back in the day.
yo fuck thats a good point
hay thats a plus
would i be bombarded by people‚Äôs surprise if i said i have never heard it before
how is red dead 2's music and art better than god of war's?
and proud of it
just dont watch shit you dont like, and if you do want to watch it for whatever fucking reason, dont make it our problem
i just want you all to know i went to bed at 6 so i could wake up at 1 am and play smash until work at 4:30 am
so i‚Äôm not allowed to not like something popular? don‚Äôt act like you never go through it
it could be quite terrible so don't be too excited.  üòõ
~~if it makes you feel better, i would probably be worse~~
but that's being human imo
current game plan for salvation of the project is making 3d models then getting the angle just right to have them align with an existing stock photo of a person using a product
his channel was my childhood
we'll see, the theme of right now is "screw it, just do it"
it's people like you who stop by and remind me that i'm still remembered for what i accomplished so long ago
and sometimes it makes threats
i've certainly gotten salty because of popularity for things i didn't care about.  it's not really a logical train of thought though, that much i will admit.  dragonite is right, why drain energy into caring about what's popular
you got two parts in and then stopped.
emile goes on a noa rant for two minutes and fifteen seconds
ooof, drinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow.  how could i forget the golden rule
this is important
gday m8
not sure how to feel about that
\:thinking\:
probably like, the end of my yt career level video combined with early yt career level editing
that didn't work
no more than normal at least
not a half bad idea
i wish i could edit myself
for somebody to fill the void of emptiness in my life
ah, the best kind of reward
oh nice
but i legit thought i failed my calculus i midterm but got 97%
otherwise i would have failed it miserably, lol
the college classes usually start later than my highschool semester but they also end earlier too
thats not too shabby
friggin hell yea man
i fucked up the curve several times in one of my entry level finance classes
this stream made a bunch of people join
to me i saw 'breakfast' and it's fairly early where i am so i was like "yea makes sense" in my head lul
except for that one semesters in freshman year in highschool
i wonder what would happen if i went around introducing myself as "mr spam"
hola y'all
calculated that back in june
i‚Äôm back from work. eyan still streaming?
oh i've come to terms with this revelation a loooooooong time ago pal
there is no reasonable hour
it's beginning of the month so we get a lot of monthly bills around this time so i've been building up for the last few days to a day of just sitting around posting them
did you record a black screen again eyan
i remember
congrats
welcome
why does it mention that you have the everyone role
i feel like most people have that one
if you send me the original pic i can do this with a better resolutino
i‚Äôll try it first, but thank you
engrossing
50 mins
you mean the finger lakes? because those exist <:kappa:374346980136058893>
what _does_ this coast hve
but i've got an ass that you need to install a mod for
is it really
yes! thank you kugal i thought i was the only one
darn it squid
dang it it‚Äôs for the holiday spirit guys
when i got promoted
squid everyone knows governments work best when theres two leaders with opposing views who dont want the other one to win
it was a 100 question ap chem test
lmao
i mean think about it. being a great runner but your name not being recognizable makes it easy to hunt people for sport but not get recognized while people snatching
man im really out of touch?
and if you get spotted what are they gonna say? "5'7" white guy in his late 20s with an average build" like theyre gonna be able to find you out based on that
whats counts as being dead on the inside?
wow dragonite
crustaceans can't play video games silly
then if your local recording doesnt have sound you can pull down the video from twitch, extract the track with just the game audio, and use that
soon‚Ñ¢
sounds fun, but i don't think that story even has an ending
welcome to the show
i mean, i was the one who came up with the term gigglebutt, lol
but he gives out free hugs sometimes
that‚Äôs west coast
yeah, no kidding
spreadsheets actually require energy right now for me.  v_v
i had to bother a company twice for a model, got it with half the dimensions missing, did pixel measurements for the rest, made the 3d model and now i need to orient it and throw it back into a stock photo using the product plus our accessory
i need more confidence, and maybe a map
i actually have an irl friend now, it's kinda weird
i dunno, i'm in a weird state right now
thanks
i could flip my loneliness to  smothered by far more attention that i could ever desire, lol
to fix it.
i appreciate the company though
on the other hand
honestly, if i could have touhou powers of some sort, i probably would just be content being my own little god
imagine the chaos that perfect possession would case in the world.
i couldn't tell you a single thing about pretty much any presentation i ever watched
how dare they only charge us 6% tax
i'm also going to have learn to trust people again, lol.  i'm way too stubborn with wanting to do everything myself
very true.
exactly
no worries.
and scanned
not really, it missed a page
i could also easily assist in that department
what's new in your world?
but if i start doing the weekly series, it could come into play
how'd ya do?
next final after this is my calculus final
got some friends that are really good at it
noice
gday mate
thankfully we did have to produce it. there would be no way
film was fun,
is it a euphemism for fart or something idk butts dont usually giggle
thankfully i stopped before i got to that level but the production of things is just overwhelming looking
all hail bob ross
crystal meth
it's true, constantly
with how the building is?
people also complained that it took too long to cover a game, which, i mean, that could be arguably a fair critism
did you know it's possible to physically move a solar system, one day the human race may say "we do it because we can" and move the sun
heyah
jello
moving the solar system how far? it's kinda already in motion
maybe it's a sign lol
just a spoiler in general
no way
guess who just got smash
the last thing is to write  my 3 minute speech about it
feels like its been 12/10 forever
i should just drop bot.js in the master branch of the repository and let everyone else figure out why it's there
yeah anyway homework bye
yay thank you
that isn't illegal either
medz plus more meds sounds great
it's calculus lol
don't worry flubs
yeah but is it quick and painless or is it slowly stop being able to breathe until all my muscles stop working and i lie there immobile as my brain stops
well that is bullshit
and i mean theres always the chance i get hit by a bus or burned at the stake for witchcraft or something
it's just on netflix
well, glas to know the tanuki leaf is called the super leaf in ultimate
it's be beautiful
if the default healing spell costs 1 magic per second, how many points of magic do you spend after casting it continuously for 3.5 seconds
just as an fyi
i have work tomorrow but it still isnt late
nah t posing in front of a freight train
also i lowered the shanty odds
and theres gotta be a maximum age for most people right? probably before you turn 12 if i had to guess
fun story my friend almost died by booking it into a tree and breaking his nose and forehead. there was blood everywhere and that is when i discovered that death is a thing
also here's a memefrom 2011
what about like your spine or something
what the crap cats
only dumb dogs
good job
oh you meant like...ohh
oi, try singing on those choir stands for 20 to 30 minutes with no lumbar support
attempt mage
the programming community should band together to destroy the evil
forknife has some problems but its the best one out there
thanks buddy
ive seen it. its pretty good
theres a non purpose?
how many hours do you think i have on ultimate <:gwsetmyxpeepoevil:405337570952740864>
if youre not playing it now the answer is "not enough"
i got a 128 gb sd card for this game
i have like a 4 gb card for my 3ds
~~but it can be better~~
i would have like that
you‚Äôd still get the best thing and use those buttons for others anyway
that it is
ggez
wait crap when did it become 11 pm
how many
the rewind has over 9.9 million dislikes
help
i just did it
then do the best sneaky cosplay there ever was!
whatever happens happens i guess lol
every day is christmas
you should totally talk to us
it's funny because he's pink nu
he'll be fine then.  meanwhile, i'm sitting here thinking that i didn't have a job until 23 if you don't count youtube
one of my friends is like barely hanging onto straight a's
i would consider it a job because you are/were making an income at one point which in my book sounds like what a job does lol
i'm tirrrrrred
falling asleep is an issue for me but so is waking up
also, yeah kugal, i guess it was technically a job, in fact a damn good one, but i feel like it did nothing for me in terms of developing skills i need for the normal workforce so now i'm playing catchup
my appetite has hit the gutter though.  i've lost 5 pounds in the past week and a half.  i'm okay with that though, i was slowly adding weight over the past year and i'm happy to shed some of it off.
morning? my day is mostly done
thats an interesting way to look at it, i havent thought of that
and also because i don't even know what kind of person i like
depression's a big dumb fuck
i value other perspectives.
i like how you evaluate the consequences of waiting and not waiting, becuase that could be the very difference in making a final decision
and i don't want to be foolish and jump into something that's doomed to fail just because i feel lonely.
because i still feel like i acted wrongly, even if i just didn't have the right information to act
i also know what i like
as long as i like them for them im happy
yea i've always been in the mindset of it's better to wait, any attempt to wait to become older to fully commit in a relationship take that opportunity
im gonna brb, i should get ready to leave here for the bloody final
or just is too screwy for my tastes.
ah yes, that's kinda important
nah, i really am just looking to talk to people
life requires and ungodly anount of patience
i don't have it down to a science, but as the years pass, i get better and better at knowing myself
woah that's an essay to catch up on
honestly wouldn‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs highly dependent on the person
which brings me back to, where's my damn life cheat codes at
except the dragonborn is life and you're alduin
she's definitely too good for me and she knows it
i mean, i'm honestly not opposed to mixing things up
if you don't start i'm gonna scan out every page of the drivers ed book i have somewhere and randomly send you pages
may have to
im back
10k subs?
i mean, in all actuality, i have some confidence when i'm not depressed as hell
that would burn through healthy mental states like a forest fire through california
yeah, arrogance
i can't have too much summer and spring though, allergies are just too rough on me.  fall and winter offer me that reprieve
not the most appropriate timing there
sadly though i couldn‚Äôt live in any other state. california has pretty much got all that i need
i think so. it‚Äôs there enough for me to remember
or something like that
i prefer to look out upon the world and see death and desolation
and i'd say i'm not exactly a road rager, but bad driving is probably my biggest pet peeve
and probably die
there is dragons, just, imaginary, lol
eyan, i‚Äôm sure you have a better chance than me in my area üòõ
there‚Äôs always full streets of parked cars here
its ok dragonite
and then i will get one
on the topic of warm temperatures
nothing is nicer than weather in the comfortable 50s on a nice autumn day
147 is borderline death are you mad
ew...
i don't know you well bella, but you seem like a good person.  i don't think the arrogance that rainy is displaying is appropriate, but i think you can feel good about yourself
well, you are his creator
ida your country is already skyrim
sadly, i always have a nagging feeling to be productive so it feels like a waste of time
is there a good mod that lets you be a bard?
and the endless power struggles
any female* single
i never used one but i know there was one bard mod that was pretty popular
death is highly overrated
no *thoughtcrime* is death
and usually anything that popular was at least good if it was what you were looking for
huh, darn i would've been good for music lol
exactly
i'll have you know
that it is, thanks flubs
welcome!
worst bot 0/10
what master said
either way pings will fly when it starts
wow how specific
no reverse cards not uno cards
hey i have a life
well, i have just reached my state of boredom that i go through every year before christmas; all i can think about is the new games i will play afterwards and nothing i have now can keep me entertained
your small people are so hard to understand
why you cant go to college and also be successful? i mean you can but i dont see why youd put yourself at a four year, hundred thousand dollar disadvantage
let people ruin their lives in peace
i actually can't wait for the return.
yea..
nice
i cant get text to zoom in in my video editor even though ive specifically selected the option designated to do so, is this some weird windows shenanigans
but also, same. sadly
i have literally gotten four mesa chassis in a row.
~~who?~~
i'm michael stevens
between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes
dont it though i mean if you got money you can get one of those cool hand freezing anti-death machines
maybe i removed it when i fixed the thing with the censor list not working
you get that a, wouldn't want anyone getting d around here
screw you
<:gwqlabsthonkery:398950779769061376>
yeah the censor list doesnt work
and ive heard good things about those pocket monster games
flubs you're a wonderful person who's going to live a long and happy life
holy shit
i feel like you do
text or call your grandma
huh.
oh, who am i kidding, of course you don‚Äôt
given that outoftouchtube is owned by google
now the only thing i send outbound email for is calling my sister dumb names
to obad im already 2200 messages behind for that
how were you not already using gmail
you too huh?  üòõ
afterward it goes back to normal style
cows are food
cows that exercise taste better btw
or at least doesnt have the time for it
mcdonalds doesnt really care if their meat tastes a little worse
you want to keep talking about this?
what'd i miss
it should probably care if the meat gets contaminated and they have to recall and check large samples for disease
who decides that's a good idea though sharing blood is the source of like half the non-malaria diseases in the history of forever
but probably no because theres no way this is gonna become a problem in my lifetime
what the hell
do i want to go in for my last final or just sleep
also surprisingly doing ok despite getting up before 4:30 today
brad is this what you do for fun
actually it doesnt but thats still an awful lot
well i know that 8.2/40 is around 20% prolly closer to 21% so you couldntve done 5 times better but definitely did more than 4.75
mood.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
then it'd kill me though
dragonite why does a highway need to own islands?
3:30-9:30
thank you
want the audiobook?
i think my transcripts get updated tomorrow
0.0 stephen is doing a weird thing with the ending song atm on stream
there
you‚Äôre definitely thinking about it a lot then
good job kugals
thanks pal
my final english grade is 98.2% lol
i cant engrish despite passing engrish final
the midterm was like 90% multiple choice with just one short response  it should have been graded by the computer
thanks <:pogchamp:305560024443518986>
quesadilla burgers are great
same honestly
hey remember in like fourth and fifth grade when we'd get like five things for homework and the teacher would have all of it graded by like the next morning
it turned a samsung galaxy into a grenade.
and whatever other fucking shit that counts as a character
skarm is god
my weapon is bad memes
i feel a growing sense of dread
i think theres one in the house in solitude that starts the whole thing
he did it
those books have an interesting property to them in regards to damned souls, bella
brb gonna go talk to her
tmw your robot has friends and you don't
oh right
why madagascar?
hmm it's 10:30 and ive gotten nothing done i brb
that's ok
lol if you want to
just turn it into a snowflake with editing magic
i wasnt on the ssformus
master these are your people or something
i guess that may be the benefit of college
oooooooo
as in my major?
dragonite42 :::)))))
doubt anyone remembers blackrayquaza except the few that knew
no matter how well i do on the final in one of my classes my grade will go down
just gotta use a bit of algebra slight of hand and u substitution and bam its super doable
it's a little rough but it's not like i'm doing anything else with my pitiful existence so may as well.
at my school it was a 65 or below was failing and you only could go on to the next class in a series if you got at least a 73
the answer is why.
it would seem that way
this is a problem
i'm down to my last brain, if that one explodes then, well i'm shutting down until my next brain get's fixed
lots of new people
but mr stabby is a snowman
a reder red lol
i'm the vb2 dragonite
hey, i can only afford 7 brains alright
then i'll throw a triangle
you said yeah first which makes the no invalid
let's burn it
kinda lame, i wanted the car alarm to go off
both
yeah i thought skull kid would be one of the newcomers
i wouldn't be angry obviously, just don't care
and it was
dovahkiin, doomguy (just for the music), crono (watched eyan lp his game so many times), crash (i played 1 game being nitro kart), 8th gen pokemon
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
everyone else that has a chance is just i don't care really
watch as the dlc pack for crono only has 1 song in it if he's a character lol
i'm more inclined to play ff6 than 7
yeah and still only 2 songs
also i think geno might be dead now
yeah i really don't understand why square is being so stingy with their ip
i'd love to see banjo in the game, but i'm not holding hope for it even with microsoft being all for the idea
and universal is owned by comcast iirc which is a competitor to disney
and well
i really don't know who else they could choose
i'd say it was that he was announced as the first dlc of the fighter packs, even at such a big event no less
exactly, what i said
for some reason, the 21st always had weird sentimental value to me for absolutely no real reason but i forgot about it this year
it makes sense actually. i think i‚Äôm the same way, but i had an earlier birthday than i was supposed to but i don‚Äôt know the date of that
*plays the ‚Äúi hate people‚Äù song from spongebob* this should be my theme song
you can catapult yourself ahead a lot faster if you get a good one
as it turns out, i'm going to be spending most of today applying for my first ever job.
paving your own path is the dream
everyone did
or at least well enough to enjoy venting his frustrations on fictional characters by brutally murdering them?
you tell me, you're the one who answered the question
either way, they need to work as well to get their pay
lets not
an ethically questionable career
it honestly annoys me even as someone who has never played their games
nice ^w^
must be an important job just sitting in one place
i see that, it's okay though, i won't ignore your ass
i'm not even going to ask questions in risk of getting snapped to dust
e!google ask reddit hangover tips
nice
but still, i just didnt get any joy from it.
i think it's supposed to be a glass of water per drink
hai friends ^w^
most people forgot about the meteos situation within two weeks, so it kinda is
they'll get over it
i frequently forget rall exists
k pop.
ohh....
i dont understand, why are there people that find underage anime girls attractive?
i mean, i'm not fine, but i'll be fine, i think
do you exercise regularly?
cuz even small things like going for a run can help combat feeling depressed and down,
i think i have an unhealthy obsession with this overcoat
neither am i
close enough
and i have a soda machine in our lunch room but i've been cutting back
i also forgot where my box was so i lost my debit card as well
anyways food is here peace
what is wrong with me
i don't even know what that is so i'm good
actually, good
it's an internship position.
today's was about cats
it's a floating island how hard can it me
nice
eh, true
the angles of it make it tough
that would be somethin' else
ive never understood that expression. like i get you *can* kick yourself but why. it doesnt even hurt
live a little
greetings, animal\_man\_.
thank you for listening to my speech
yeeeaaaaaahhhhhhh
switch things up
"blow me" -eyan
those bastards
magus9000 fainted!
i mean youd assume as much
honestly yeah
oh that
you got that pretty spot on
what are the main memes of 2018
i'm just depression drinking to ignore the fact i'm spending christmas entirely alone
i'm not eating there
i don't have time i just make it by putting off things that are actually important
i've never been so complimented and intrigued at once
cool
based on the context, you
but cool
get fallout 4
what are we fucking?
magfest is a 3.5 day event so on any given day there's a 1% chance that i'll be at magfest
the rest being days off from work, partying with your friends, and watching gladiatorial events
kings orders
cheese
merry christmas eve, ya nerds
music and gaming festival
of course you did
have fun, don't break anything
oh i have some time rn, time to scan out the driving rules book and start bothering bella with that
all driving speeds will be in m/s
*me starts harmonizing* who lives who dies who tells your story
i like how the modern internet just lets you google strings of six words and instantly find out who said them
ironically missed the ping because i was playing sims 3
yummy
nice
i'm pretty sure we lose like four one-millionths of a second per year or something
so today i was playing my drums, with my phone bluetooth connected to my headphones and then when i decided to stop playing i dropped the phone onto a drum, and it landed onto one of th tension rods in the worst possible way ever
its the one people want the most of
that is, if you play the drums
come to think of it, i actually need to get a phone at some point in the near future
well you can be alive on the outside and dead on the inside
like one day the charger port just decided to lose any and all grip
the clone wars

sheogarth - guru of madness
i'm on data
mine may have a second one, but with the only angle i'm viewing it from, it'd be impossible to see
it's always an experience
merry christmas, nerds.
at least send him to the right channel
i thought mine was missing a few vowels
the twelve days of christmas?
he‚Äôs a baby so most of them are blurry as heck
nice
im ok
i could say whats on my mind right now, but i'll save it for when he's sober <:lul:305559915714576385>
is it on sale?
<:roopog:442070287769403402>
happy crimas friend
it came to me
she is
i am a goddess
hey eyan are you streaming tomorrow
ok nice
they have coffee. i am sleepy. it‚Äôs also almost eleven. it‚Äôs probably not worth
well its for ps4
other than that one time
shes into kinky shit
why does mute not fucking work on the bot
<:gwnonexmaikasmug:402867199825674251>
it‚Äôs still only christmas #1 tho
merry christmas
so my average day for the past year consists of 7:51 of sleep, 3:20 warframe, 2:39 school, 1:40 with eyan, 1:36 with family, 0:57 on homework, 0:37 in the car, 0:36 on reddit, and everything else is bellow half an hour so its inaccurate
happy christmas exclusively to those who dont celebrate
christmas merry
hmmm sleep what a good idea
theres a second one?
id join and sing but my throat is missing
how loosely?
i might pop into the stream later when my family is not here and i actually have peace and quiet
i‚Äôm a baconator
cakeonator
underwhelmed
ator*
i'm just gonna stay in call while playing ffxiv
huh. actually gotta go, hopefully stream'll still be up when im back
santa's stand is jesus?
good lord you people are still in voice?
well then the little things should make you not miserable
okay, ,christmas party in vc.
thank god
so you got 3.4 years
my shit is beokken
i asked for a new phone for christmas. hopefully, i get it tomorrow
i drank soda does that count for something <:kappa:374346980136058893> lol
this is the most i've drank in
oh fuck
lmao thanks i think
guys

nope
nani
hey guys remember christmas from chrono trigger?
you get in for comedy
that test would have me fail hilariously
coward
yeah but not for you
i mean
me too
panic mode activate
ruined the grading curve
deja vu
i win???
rise up
look
duel me
they don‚Äôt reach a peace, that‚Äôs alright
you got this
time to get some pistols and a doctor on site
you have him turn around so he can have deniability
honestly, i'm stupid proud of that timing
hmmmm
you pay him in advance, you treat him with civility
oh god
that's me falling out of my chair
how can men be so fucking dense
like what the fuck
at any given chance
did rainy just get cursed
are you calling eyan stupid
it's a mess
mucho mejor
depends on starting location and end destination
yes danit
oh my
what
did i say an expensive skin?
fuck you
i'm in school, so that's where it's spent
not rn
so like
panda can‚Äôt math
eyan, go to mag with me, i'll cosplay star guardian ahri
i‚Äôll try to. i haven‚Äôt played in a while
weird, me too
tsa broke a $400 prop
eyan
nevermind
we can‚Äôt hear you. at least i can‚Äôt
hear who
all of my attraction
ehhh
oh im stupid
i'm just drunk
go to hell, robot
it's one of those big neckhole ones
wait get one for me while you're at it
i paid and played
thanks! hope you all have a good day
no thanks lol
you're just noticing?
nerds
considering i dn't die of hangove
eyan
reminds me of infintie hover in jak 2/3
you know you love it, babe
wow, eyan just called me cute
no clue how it works tho so rip lol
we killed him
me and my sister were playing smash this morning, on the gamer stage
i wasn't here when that happened
also she's your age, i'll introduce you, she also loves gamers rise up and prequel memes and warframe and is about your age
holy fuck
how dare you assume assumptions
what is sleep
you always do, babe
awww
dumb
you like drunk me?
heed
he's dumb
nighty
and also to god
night guys ^w^
did you see that density chart
i probably will soon enjoy, i fucking love hiking
oh everyone's gone
haven't gone on any this month, probably a good idea to go burn off the like 4000 calories of booze anythe 300 calories of christmas dinner
i got an electric blanket for christmas and it has helped wonderfully to alleviate cold
7% but i'll ignore it on rainy's behalf
you seemed to be quite interested at one point in time
lol, i know i'm weird
gimme a sec, i gotta get back in character
also eww
you're right
it's okay, i am too
i mean, you could be like rainy, she's interesting, but it cost her her soul
i mean, people in general arent very interesting. they dont have character arcs to follow and no cool powers. they just complain and use resources until they roll over and die
i am a cheap date for real, i look for the chicken on the menu and order like the cheapest thing, if not a salad
i mean
being that awesome doesn't come free
oh, so we're role playing now
it's such a bother to have to keep turning all caps on and off
enlighten me, why?
because you are innocent
rainy said this [2:01 pm] thy queen, zealots: you can just yelll at me, i'm into it
fair enough
r/askreddit i assume?
same, they feel like a waste of time
there was some story on reddit about things people accidentally said during sex and that story blew up and went full scale meme
i don't call him that, master is a... reserved term for me
don't worry, i can definitely get more mad
thank you my queen
so just as a warning, dont get mad if it is very stupid
you'd have to be some eyan levels of dense
are eyan and rainy dating?
all of em
no, please do
she just likes fucking with me
go to hell robot
that's not how being dense works
does it ever not?
this day is draggin
also you only got what, 2 hours left
dumbass
normally it's like 40-50 minutes depending on how fucked i get, but it should be 30 tops today
unfortunately
look
and rome wasn't built in a day, i know all too well that looking beautiful takes time
i blame rainy
that's how i felt yesterday, but i think that's just called  a hangover
new year new me
i'm capable of trying
just gotta gimme the word to release it
new year's isn't until next week
pfft, that's up to your discretion
materials for everything else: <$80
obviously
rainy only shared one of the two cat pics
so do i, i built a youtube channel off of it
yeah that sounds about right
what's the least ajit part of florida?
don't ruin my fantasy eyan
wait
i'm gay now
should we document dragonite as an scp
if you must specify a playable race, probably balgruuf the greater
yeah that
who is the hottest male character in skyrim?
too much stress
i can make any cosplay for any body, given enough... experience with said body
there are quite a lot of medical students though
why would i not be?
you won't stop me from handling you sexually? wow, truly a scholar and gentleman
hmmm
picky, are we?
people like complaining more than money duh
good job (‡πë‚Ä¢Õà·¥ó‚Ä¢Õà)b
nice
we have children?
hmmm
technically i'm referring to my ap system, not windows
i didn't even know we were dating let alone that far into things
i get the pc
"rainy - guru & queen of ass"  something like that?
a-sofs
i get his cat
i ain't eyan's s tuff
but i dont know if i could handle that responsibility
highly effective
oh look, rainy is finally understanding how i became more dense than a black hole
me right now
well, it's up to her, lol
you're good at drawing a bunch of scribbles and pretending they're instructions
are you?
what were your expectations?
i wanted to go to prom, but
ill get the flamethrowers
alcohol?
but i wanna dance
eyan you just need to learn how to optimize your talents, is all
black 2 and white 2 came out
i didn't choose anything last night
plot twist, i was gay all along
that was worth it
thank you for that
now see what you did
btw, 9k, set our permissions for the voice channels to include anything prehistoric frog and above
and thus rainy cried
no idea what you're talking about but okay
fuck all that
hmm?
i never would have guessed from the name
imagine being assassinated by someone who uses a knife and fork for their pizza
it recommended a game called boobs saga
so it was _you_ who sent me the free trial of playboy magazine?
steam apparently understands me
what's with you and baconators?
you'll notice i said "mostly"
probably
it's not your fault
huh, maybe i don't have you beat then, technically i only have 3 but i had a fourth that was close
i doubt she remembers half the names
i'm sorry
you dont have to give us an exact number, just the data type that would be required to store them
yeah but with even more ways to start an explosion
and i can just go back though my google account that i use for tindr contacts
like all over the damn place
i sort of always imagined rainy is the personification of a nuclear bomb
i'd say she needs to aim
zero
the deepest emotional connection i've had heretofore...
how depressing do i wanna get with this?
probably wise
backup brains, i burned through 3 of them in my theory final yesterday
no swearing.
well i'm not
oh yes
everything
the heart wants to beat
my two year+s with men permanently scarred me (one literally) and my year+ with a girl is still my friend
the heart wants a beating
but on the other hand the brain gave us video games
yeah but brains also invented the lobotomy
that sounds like a problem that can be taken care of at a later point in time
stop
therefore brain is stupid
granted i haven't looked at any of em
i type, send, and than ignore
i mean i wouldn't have put it past me to have sent a few to random people by accident
keep it on
i mean
you should send them to random foreign emails
play smash bros.
same honestly
cause in it's time, it was fucking stupid
unless it's to x person/people who shan't be named
not brilliant
you were
driving trip continues, i'll be there at like 1
you're welcome
clearly
bring me some takis to apologize
<:roodab:509458870700212235>
i ain't picky
lets get it
shall i spam it
so it doesnt really matter
good shit girl
i dunno, next summer
hmm, i'll move to st catharines, seems like my kind of city
but alas
i just wanna live in canada
no promises
what kinda breakfast do you prefer?
but eyan
alright, fine, i'll take the pic after i make you breakfast, if you're clothes aren't on by then you're a lazy fuck
probably not
can i come in the middle of it than?
you will not escape coffee
fair
that it is
we have acquired the vip, back in another 50
hear me out
i'll be long gone
tim horton's is üëå
nice
yo right
unless it was just a jebait
none of them are talos
okay artemis and aphrodite are actual gods so props to you for using actual gods
empire loves lists
actually isaac brock
i also love tea
move everything else down a step
the christians are so boring with one jackass
so a clean 10 now ok
no offense to any christians in here but your religion robbed me of the first 16 years of my life
that stuff is just... no
even thought mike is still alive
and jack daniels
me or 9k?
to make a molotov with?
making a molotov without vodka is heresy
wait you mean it's possible?
i'll let you know later
doesnt sound like anything new
whos the manager?
rainy have you tried a preschool that doesn't have catholic influence?
and then the vip starts screaming mother of god at an average sized deer like 50 ft away from the road
yeah it is better the vip is roasting dad's bad management
the anti-virgin
power of what?
he wants anything
if you make that graph
well it's certainly not the heaven i want.
i will add on another dirnk to what i owe you
my ego
flubs
such a sucker for food?
megumin, put her close to but below me
anywhere
hiya will
that scale tho lol
i am aroused
thanks deci and panda for setting the curve
i work in a hispanic restaurant
i'm just going through discord look for things i called god at any point
ok rain
can you fill this out
it's a metroidvania hack n slash
and the 100%+ percent come from things outside of the game universe
this is fidget, she killed god
that's the only material i know on top of my head cause it sounds like weed
rude
fidget killed god
thats less than not productive
skyrim?
hell yeah
it's the goddamned skyrim engine
i'm into it
time is math
time off means memory decay
it has a purpose
should be fired
integral of y dx
why did he design malaria
#blamerainy
just integrated one of the craziest functions, got this as the answer lul
not much, you?
and i can‚Äôt fall back asleep because i‚Äôm hungry
but you won't go the fuck to sleep
i‚Äôm just glad i have today off. but i probably won‚Äôt be able to take a nap for a little while
i'm much more at home in inkscape than gimp, but i'm learning, i think.
and i told you to go the fuck to sleep
oh, so we want to debate semantics of what is possible vs what is justified?
oops all caps
i wish it was time for lunch
i love the genre though so i'll never not like metroidvania
that's deep
the number one reason i want smash is to play castlevania, lol
the number one reason i want smash is because smash
he'd be way too op
when that shit comes around i'll have to settle for not actual nerds cause all the actual nerds will be fucking their computers
ooh, yummy.
yeah, and?
i'm just depressed
wow 9k, i've never seen someone on here have such a correct opionion
dark chocolate is where it's at
i mean, milk chocolate is fine if it's what you desire
you're wrong on the grounds that you annoy me
dark chocolate reflects the bitter, stygian nature of my soul. i have a connection to it that spans the eons
he's just dumb, he doesn't know what he's saying
we shall rest when we are dead
this kingdom doesn't actually have rules against any type of death
you see the trick is to do that before you leave the shower
try harder
this is too lewd
how's saturday at 6 sound?
pardon me, i am as dense as the entire universe packed into a tiny spec of spacetime right before the big bang
my place
you want her to give you a not dumb reason?
real life is dragging me out of my coffin
imma take an aside to say i have a great butt.
i just had the anime scenario of trying desperately to get my new jeans over my butt
also, who the fuck spends 1609.58 on a 100 napkins
i have several chapters of gov notes to take care of before that which i haven't started on either
that's cause you're stupid
sounds like it‚Äôs doable at least
i mean, i got a b
mmmmm
eyan what's the integral of 3dx
but in high school, that was failing for me
high school was hell for me
but i had just over 1500 on sat and 34 on act
listen here you little shit
so applying for schools is fun
oof no reminders about gpa
took one, did fuckall on the english and essay portions, somehow got 1440
my condolences rc
not really, i didn't try that hard, lol
hope so
eyan
mmk, that's acceptable
yeah, dia
kinky
i have no siblings, but i look forward to fucking with my cousins in the same way
that should answer all questions
oh yeah that works
but the pixel count
it's in the show
the blonde's outfit on my desktop is one of the cosplays i have now
that's
cause i feel like that should be prerequisite to meeting me
that one?
they have icons
i see you're on the winning side
maybe
for like, everyone
even the bot hates me
if the rapture happened would it resemble the snap?
curiosity expands the known data set to expand a search for potential patterns which can in the long term simplify the work necessary to get a desired answer
i expect nothing less
how many people sailed out into the unknown and were never heard from again before one managed to find a new land?
he does proc the censor on edits thought
yeah, we're all just sentient links in a very long chain of evolution. the way we sway will have an impact on the future for others
neither does living another 10 years
sure having them around is great for then and there but that impact is limited. if that group does manage to find somethi- this is the part where i realize i have no idea where i'm going with this
sure it does
are we planning on re-implementing the naughty words censor or something
that's a topic for down the road
something about elon musk wanting to have other companies put him out of business
also master im disappointed you did not save fus go fuck yourself
fair enough
in a good way or a bad way
what is a man
hmmm
curiosity creates long term gains at the price of potential short term losses if you're not careful
eyan isnt it past your bedtime
that's what curiosity gets you
doesnt automatically invalidate them all
wait that happened?
if you ever think you did something stupid, just remember, at some point in human history someone decided to squeeze a cow's udders to see what happened _and it caught on_
actually it doesnt
and are they still alive
do you have any data on how often questions in this server actually end with question marks
you mean tomato juice right
some people are into that
what is a man
jesus is into drinking blood
so one to one reply to valid conditions should be fine
it's symbolic ya ninny
nice
ok so yesterday you defined who was in the pantheon
>for 10 million, i think my wife would be there cheering me on.
well i'm out until later, so it'll have to wait
by the 8
ask about the most obscure thing possible
i have stuff to do for the next hour or so
also fuck the thalmor too
eyan it's just an array chill
mages can cast beneficial spells on others, does that make them gods?
most of the time
hmm it magically came back
this is a good one to start with
i never let it get that close, i'm always 4 points ahead
good luck have fun
i'll be home in 20 and beat all y'all's asses
when does the day start?
you live
chocolate chip?!
yeah just mix booze with snowberries, moon sugar, and frost salts
spiced brandy
go for it
the precision of this spreadsheet is an art
yeah
just reeeee
don't underestimate my power
we're playing for second place
cards against humanity isnt a game you play to win. its a game you play to make as many dark jokes as possible
eyan you're ok with boring
i mean, you're invited if you want ida
i can't wait to go crash at eyan's hotel whenever he's working night audit
but he doesn't have to be up
guys go to sleep
haven't we all?
too tired?
i mean....
cause you said $25 a month
i was a daytime bartender at 17
if someone gets hurt, that's an assault charge
oh i can assure you
but eyan
do you though?
i could just what?
i look gay in glasses
so i love em
<:treason:396483914803445761>
am i not worth the effort?
does he go on the pantheon?
he portrayed an emotionally confused late teen rather amazingly
i like my girls with short hair
sipho dias is the real mvp

"are you having a fucking chuckle" -rainy rn
depends on the day
out of what set?
oh uhhh
a perfect culmination
a solid one
go to the store sometime this week
alright glhf
cold
i kinda wish i was at work right now, so much regret will be had tonight
around here at least
so, never?
that was a very fitting response actually
which one
proud of you
think of all the pretty things you can buy me
i'm never bored, just attention starved
i'm never bored
my next one is *probably* gonna be a treehouse
guess who just spent three hours building a house in terraria
e!bot
i *think* i know how to
4tn1te
she just wants me to call her mommy
it also may have been spillover from dc
oh yeah you missed thsi thing
which happened to permeate like 1.5 states
she was giving pieces of information and i wanted to have it all mapped out nicely
you call that nicely
my critics are... usually shortlived
i was distracted scp readings
i call that a clusterfuck
better.
just saw coffee
yeah thats right skarm
i've still got 4 hours and 35 minutes
is it better than regular coffee?
what will cup of java give you
the drawstring that i normally take places is got a bunch of holes in it
stream nerds

and then theres the last year memes that theybforgetbto remove from the production build
probably not
üëÄüëÄ
the turnpike has opened up to three lanes though so theres probably less than 70 miles left
good job
same thing
hungover stream
wouldnt the light from the screen hurt his eyea
there are a bunch of people who tell me it's good, should i submit to defeat and join them?
just buy another hard drive
did anybody else ask?\
hmm should i join stream or get things done for the first time since forever
lmao he started singing in another server so it continues here
those are full too
i'm gonna buy a suite so that i can cook shit... though i don't think gaylord suites have ovens... hmmmmm
what do you even do at conventions
good job unicode (‡πë‚Ä¢Õà·¥ó‚Ä¢Õà)b
have you ever eaten at the sports bar thing inside the gaylord? every time i dropped by the wait time was like an hour long
d&d is probably something i'd love, yet have never touched
also ida, oh honey
i will host d&d&d in my room at mag
that's next year
nice
oh wait wrong thing
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
i mean, i have no expectations for you
how sweet of you
i had classes today running off 3.4 hours
i have class again on monday and really not looking forward to it
thanks quitcorrect
but i also need to scan 14 pages
also is that new profile pic from a comic?
parents franchise documents for who is going to what events and who's paying how much
scan?
it was fun seeing him
i'm so sad i missed out on the peak of vr chat
havent seen him in a year or so
oh wait i know why
pi vpn
scanning is easy when youre able to stand
i dunno, however much force it takes to stop ~50kgm/s of momentum
just like me
then that depends on how long it took
yo that name is cursed
feel better kugal
nerd
maybe one n
don't you do it
well welcome back, bac. we missed you.
i find it weird how i can rename myself in literally every other server i‚Äôm in but it‚Äôs restricted in this one
i agree
like i dont get whats up with that
i find that actually to be wrong
not as rarted
how much can i cuss
i was gonna test it out
how do you play skyrim
but like minus 500 hours
that is a pretty awesome avatar, lol
it was my compliment first <:gwaobapepecry:395628671911854081>
but i have a lot
to quote eyan from earlier today, " you're not my mother"
ok skarm take a few steps back
thats a good quote master
screw this bot
and looking for somebody to love
yeah if we act normal in the beginning its just gonna make the truth even more horrible
oh my
less entertaining
midnight, so basically, pretty early
also new friend, as server mom, lemme know if i need to beat anyone up.
midnight
radiation is bad for you
alright off the showers i go
and do you sing?
what classification of waves are good ass vibes?
if you want to be bored
i scream in the shower
ive been moving along at a snails pace tonight
not to sound like a loser n all but like i used to play my pokemon games along side eyan
they don't bite, except for eyan... well at least hopefully
the horror
eyan you what
show me the situation
ctrl shift q
have you tried... ctrl z
oh, i found a cute ass princess peach hat at target
eyan

i bet that pp is so huge
it's average size
oops

by texas law, i'm pretty sure saying salutations allows you to take ownership of another's boyfriend
it's the law
you cannot say those things
it's okay i ask myself that question every once in a while
rainy this is the real tmabird who made everybody's circulation btw
must not strangle rainy
<:rooaww:530069696058228754>

i am a man i think
are we talking about relationships
oh wait
a fucking loser
i hate guys like that
double win
i just wanted to see how far i could stretch
i could make such a depressing joke that it would definitely ruin my night
oh hey, i opened that
yeah, ffxv, main four characters genderbent
i dunno which one do you think i should do :o
i am mostly done with my cosplay for the leftmost gal
i just need to get the abs
3rd fits your character as far as i can tell
chubby is fine
i'm surprised there's no "#selfies" channel in this discord
night bella <:roohi:510305569475657740>
well
i mean
better
i don't actually know how to play guitar
nice to meet you, see you later
we were talking about depressing stuff
i can play the piano way better
and insecurites
yeah lol
~~what if he‚Äôs working?~~
cause tp was a full engine rewrite
<:gwgoashuu:405753103326117888>
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
~~6 exeggcute or 1 exeggcute?~~
~~maybe you killed him~~
one, i have curly fucking hair
that sort of thing goes in <#311402910820859914>, arkada.
can i just say
that's 30 minutes on it's own
when eyan said a few
all of them
and since it's a weekend i do my once a week skincare routines, like 15 minutes
do you need a hint, darling?
but the only attention you give me is the rude kind, lol
<:gwomoraphiohmy:405784196783538196>
<:kappapride:379352530863521792>
hey eyan
i know i am
it doesn't mean you're not cute tho
<:gwfateesip:392307687955628034>
speak for yourself
ooh fun
i love night shifts
no no
victorian
is that a thing now
oh ok
uv radiation
it's the uv radiation of the sun that's the issue
not uv light
it does, but in miniscule amount
can i just live inside of an x-ray machine
hopefully
according to the song
i love d&d i just wish i had more spare time to play
by putting down the things he doesn't like
i recently just finished a campaigng
ive just never found the right people to play with. theyre all fun and nice, they just dont keep consistent enough schedules to play ever
but the usually coincide
honestly, i just don't have time and other people for tabletop gaming nowadays. aside from the rare instance that i do.
i feel personally attacked
hello gambit but with boobs
with discord and roll20, for example
i ruin everything :)
according to this book, eyan is too much of a coward for us to date
so, play read dead or hear eyan preach more about investment banking <:thinkingsteps:396534879833292810>
god i hate children
what else does it say
stream.
rather unfortunate indeed
you mean almost by "all 3 were nearly killed" or "the number of children i have killed is approaching 3"?
astrophysicist carl sagan?
half the time that's when i end up going to sleep
oh right, eyan‚Äôs birthday is today
what happened to wolverale?
help
i can
i still think <:kappa:374346980136058893> looks similar to emile
i'm assuming that's there as a joke, considering candyman is the only with it.
just now?
also wait
thats right, "always"
at the very least, i hope we get a mini direct like last january
so all of us are free to abuse your bot then, since he did it to us first
i don‚Äôt know actually
also am i the only one who finds it weird how someone would want to avoid knowing about dlc content
just a thought
other way around here, sleepy but not tired
hmmmm
so go ahead
i am lonely, i am gay, i have depression
but sleep is still a solution to exhaustion
you're not wrong
and i know that difference better than most
that was a very heavy "uhh"
i am very opposed to doing something
the only reason i'm here is because eyan is
as most things are in my life
its for your own good
eyan leave
what am i saying
he just admitted it more or less, lol
yes you are
nah, just depressed
hey look on the bright side though
its just a matter of doing it
is that am or pm
i can't tho. i clock of at 7. i still got like most of my shift.
noted
uh....retail :)
do you work in the loading bay
this has probably been posted here before but i can‚Äôt be bothered to look through the few months of stuff i‚Äôve missed so here
ooos it‚Äôs one
i did that for a few days and basically ceased existing
didn‚Äôt feel like it at all
hate it how that just kinda happen s
oh yeah thats me
i ws going to make a joke but i decided against it
im not a fan of onions
im bad at type
i am mostly just fond of them on burgers
i think a game crashing on a loading screen is better than it just loading forever
pretty much try every food at least thrice
in the show
i didn't ask about taste lol
the first pokemon ash is shown to have is a voltorb
just name daniel robert gheesling, maybe include a home address or something
woke up to see star wars on. nice
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
<:king:356095432495202315>
idaaaaaaaaa ive been listening to people talk about d&d all weekend and i really wanna play but i cant sit still for that long
when we start doing annual zeal meetups we can play for a few hours each time
genius
so you know how
i'd have to go with switch
this is quite the predicament
that‚Äôs fair.
because the earlier ones could also play ps2 games
get the gpu of the ps4 and cpu/ram of the switch, then you can play both
bloons
oh yeah that one too
4 is unlucky thats why
oh damn
you guys wanna waste more time with league?
currently not home, so i would join later
nice
thats why im waiting for the netflix version of the cw shows
20 is not bad.
that‚Äôs the point, i like seeing people‚Äôs reaction when it‚Äôs going on
i mean, we spend time more on games yknow?
~just rewatch the crossover all summer~
but then you watch everything super late.
i‚Äôve only seen it a couple times... its not even about the game.
i get to into movies
as a mets fan i lead a life of annual disappointment
except for 2015
i doubt thats legal
goodmorningall
not gonna lie the only game i want on swich is smash
so far the games i‚Äôve played on pc don‚Äôt do as much for me as console games have
look at his sub animation
did somebody say miku?
oh my god
can i share them in this chat?
i have
never thought of it
i have a miku print somewhere but all my past con stuff is kind of just shoved away waiting to actually be displayed one day
also i have acquired pizza
that way you have an idea when you are financially ready but cpu and motherboards change so quickly youd have to make some changes when you are ready
i mean
i can get him to stop if you want
driving is my sanctuary when i am a sad boye
all the important places are nearby
one day
"empty" streets are nice
we have to drive 25-30 minutes to do anything
steal the silverware for yourself, then
i enjoy cities when it comes to visiting but not when it comes to living. i will never live in a city
i take it that the midwest is no longer high noon land
is it that, or a natural godsend?
where i live our biggest concern is tornados
however
yeah, northeast is good for dodging natural disasters, the worst ya get is snow
yeah but new orleans isnt even that big
disaster
still big enough to do a lot of damage
wacky? really?
im like part of tornado alley tho
also we're pretty good at moving a lot of people around quickly
true, there aren't just roads in new york. there's also the subway system
well that's not really anything new for hurricanes in general
the residents are cannon fodder no matter what city they're in when a storm goes for the particular city they're living in.
the more south they are, the worse they are.
return of the jedi is now starting
ah, return of the jedi, what a classic
i dont know what youre talking about
lol rip
yeah
those maps they show you in school are all wrong
also birds arent real and the moon is a myth
satorl marsh is probably the butt tbh
i'm never too drunk for investment banking
eyan, my honour has been bismirched, defend me
okay, now they have the right to die
well that is just rude
oh they're long gone.
why do people ever feel like that?
rainy have you ever piloted an automobile
same as g
though with working at a hotel, i feel eyan has more available
understandable
cant you just get more out of candyman?
you make a compelling argument
i certainly pay dividends though.
i'd like to think that eyan knows better
but you can still think of all the really pretty things you could buy me.
eyan knows a good relationship will be an expensive one regardless
i usually prefer thinner and crispier, mushy fries make me sick
eww fries
so shoestrings over steak?
ever had a gretan, arakda?
i'll see if i can find one.
he's a doctor now
ughhhhh
i have so much tired
yeah, economy, sorry
so i'm at less than 15 in the past 72, why god. why?
something must be wrong
to be fair, i wouldn't want to watch last jedi again anyways, lol
every time i think about that movie, i think of more ways it pissed me off, lol
i'm never bored
i'm just glad that j.j. abrams is directing episode ix
i do it for rey
cutting out the parts with finn probably would‚Äôve helped
i'm sure a lot of the critics who loved it were paid by disney lol
i agree demon lord, i'd much rather have abrams back
the fuel is what matters
if i recall correctly rainy paid $10 for that
do u mean gratin
that it is
i forgot that‚Äôs a thing here
same
i just wish i had more outlet's. since my pc/internet has been a bust for months all i have is my laptop. so i'm very limited on what i can do. im tired of watching movies, anime, youtibe videos. i'm bored and sad. not a good combo tbh
take up gambling
you want to get more out of what little free time you have?
have you tried stardew valley?
that's a good way to just delete free time
story of my life lol
oh it is, i've enjoyed playing through the world of light
they should have ryan reynolds cameo in dc and starwars movies
jeez 9k, it's like you aren't even mlg lvl 30 in btd5 *or* btd6
rude
ooh congrats
i didn‚Äôt read it tho
<:gwoiczenthink:390299938250293250>
go outside or something <:kappa:374346980136058893>
last time it took 9 mins before she left
not even on pc yet
a manakete would be sick as hell, but it won't happen
nobody would expect that now
my dumbass just hit the power button by accident
welcome
i didn't know when my last save was, but it was only ~15 minutes
eyan has been popping a lot of bloons
we can make a night of it
non-stop
rainy i gotta warn you
he is competitively ciable
he's b tier
yes he does
but one you play him
of who the third character might be
xenoblade chronicles' composer did a remix of gangplank galleon and it's nnnnnnnnnnffff
piranha plant, joker, and -redacted-
yeah
i think it'll be a final fantasy rep
oh ok
for that 3rd character?
i know i am but what are you, eyan
with two games so far
wow did they even try
also again
dark pit is s tier
eyan
a "cosplay"
you'll be extra down
she's hotter than you remember
nice!
excuse me for my french but
i played a fair amount of link too
my queue is bugged
that was my 616th
neet
iowa is in central
that was a fantastic last game
also
by at least two hours
anytime you want
oh goody
if i knew why i was sad
i have terrible taste in men apparently
just dont be sad lmao
you have some low spec games to play?
what's up lol ^w^
plus i enjoy typing
bella i thought you were like, 18 lol
ooooh they have the watchmen movie on netflix. i havent seen it and wish i realized that three hours ago
which co-worker?
nope
ha, it's not even 1 here
yeah but it explains boobs
just a hunch
no the suit is what makes them look pretty
majestic heres the actual spoiler part for someone who isnt familiar with the game at all: then the infestaiton made the minds of the warframes basically non-existent so then the tenno transferenced into them
night bella ^w^
that sleep schedule tho o.o
don‚Äôt call me dan, dan
you are saying
did you just call me candy dan
i've killed people for less
this is a fucking wild prediction considering that game was...well, kinda shit in comparison to the rest of the prime series
hey, kamui uses a chainsaw
candyman kill me
he's definitely the last metroid character that i think can be reasonably added to the lineup
really, not many classic metroid characters are characters i think they can reasonably add to smash
kraid is a part of one of the brinstars
and i trust retro to do something
here's hoping no executive meddling happens. it looks like samus will make a full recovery from being on hiatus.
"oh yeah lets release prime hunters shortly before prime 3 and then do fucking nothing with anything we did in that game"
i now see why it is rated t
i just think it's an out there choice that makes sense
since hunters took place between prime 1 and 2
wait all the hunters are alive
that second part was uncalled for
some would say lord retard
the oversear
skarm is retarded
~~she probably bribed eyan~~
id let a stranger fuck me for 10m
nay.. like a horse?
cause like, then that's a triple win
i mean... its not like they have to watch it
paid for a house with sex
hmmmm
it's lovely dear
and if i could get my partner involved in it, it's like a win-win-win-win
just be single forever like me
just answer once for yes, once for no
glad we cleared that up
did not mean to dc lol xd
there's a bunch of outfits that make the characters in their underwear and nothing else
alright
i said everyone, not everything
thanks
i'm reading an article about rockstar games and it casually mentioned that `this comes after the news last week that the xbox scarlett and ps5 next-gen consoles are expected to be announced in 2019`
that speech class is as hectic as i expected
it‚Äôs only not creepy if the standing person is hitchhiking. it‚Äôs creepy under any other situation
something something work suck
wasn‚Äôt even doing that either, so that‚Äôs when you know, that person is a bad.
eyan dont say the f word
it was on sale
why did nobody tell me about this
fucking weebs
nope
boots
boots
pretty sure that was confirmed quite  whilel ago
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
i'm pretty sure the official nintendo account hasn't tweeted anything yet
isnt there always a big january blowout though
i don‚Äôt think any direct has been announced
the 10th has been speculated for a while
what will we do with a drunken sailor
most problems are
that's cool
yeah at some point i think i didnt really care
but yeah gordon ramsay would be cool
id assume the friction of moving makes that far more likely
but there's better air flow
just like that
agh my calc ii prof hasnt gotten back to me so now im slightly terrified he wont before the class begins lmao
oh man they actually still post a small number of videos every few years
i mean if you just walk through sand like that you probably had it coming
i steal things and ruin lives, not use magic to fix stuff
hmm you might not object to that
is this like lwiay but for papa ryan?
ok then
wake up you hoe
cynthia would like a word with you
easy top 3
i'm just excited for joker's gameplay trailer
i don't recall hearing about the characters representing new franchises
i like how im already done with work for today
for the record it's "tertiary"
i just started
walked back into class as they were taking about memes
it just works
you and i speak the same language
i haven't gotten anything really bad since about 2010 either. somehow around then i got an infection that caused my computer's printer spooler to stop working. that was fun. and a pain in the neck because in 2010 i had to actually print out stuff.
python
maybe i should enter it into a virtual machine or something and find out
don't worry rainy, i still like you
weirdo
any preferences as to how?
never claimed to not be normal
it just sounds like a gutteral hissing
as much as i want to give you attention rainy, it's my lunch break
probably something with sheep
wait a minute
i literally just play to get diamond than quit
caged
finger had a minor stroke
whenever the last season started
haven't played since like a year ago
good thing i'm always tired
i'm at like 10, i want 6 more
but i'm never tired enough
well that and i somehow overlooked the fact that he said we should do this again sometime <:rooderp:531156967943569410>
yes you do
oh wait, i might actually have a reason to be sad
you left it up to me and what i decided wasn't good enough
wow, not giving attention to me, so rude
we should abolish snow
and mag 2020, the year someone finally teaches eyan how to dress himself
my heart feels at home
i'm good at like
surprise me
it‚Äôs like how 2010 sounds really recent
sounds like a bad year to me
dammit eyan, i fucking told you to save me some
the second i consume a single carb, all my abs will disappear
girls don't eat cake
this is discord, shitbrains
maybe i should go back to bed
i mean, i believe it
i mean, so does getting slapped in the face
i just remembered how i used to wear hoodies in the middle of summer
i mean i'm not aiming high for life, namely because i want to get a red seal for an electrition
especially electritions, that trade is one of the highest deficits in canada

yo same
sylas when sylas steals shyv ult he has her spells for the duration
i am insulted
t b h
somebody asked me a question and i responded
stop being so popular
i was very on topic thank you
hmmmmm
and how he's such a dad
you wanna play now or later, how you feelin
maybe
also, are you guys playing overwatch without me?  cause that's rude
jeez
panda
will you though?
do talk more
also what we playing
yeah that
soo much
games stuck on a black screen
stuck on "entering game"
<:gwoiczenthink:390299938250293250>
just remove the 40000
thanks
i'm giving my share to the people
does anyone have any recommendations of what kind of parts i should buy for my pc in the spring time?
that was fast
ok but i feel like there are better ways to do that
are you trying to _reduce_ your job security good sir
that would be good
for a gfx card
and i think there better than a 1060
i literally dont know what you're talking about
they need food <:gwaobapepecry:395628671911854081>
sylas
thank you autocorrect
rainy goes gay like 5 times a week, i'm not too worried about it
i generally only play one or two types of games, i only like a few genres of anime, i do the same things over and over
because rainy likes being complicated
i mean why don't you say you're bi and get over with it
jesus christ you fucking morons
same
clearly
nobody here was claiming that you said there was something wrong with vanilla
elaborating on their definition of being boring
or at least i was
also do most people side with the empire? reddit is like 90% stormcloak lmao
i wonder if those are the same people who turned on nick in fallout 4
ice cream is far more important
or is that mjoll
because usually theres also programming in there
it's overwatch time
men love boobs and skyrim
place your bets for how long it'll take before we optimize and talk about boobs _in_ skyrim
there are no good boobs in skyrim
someone doesnt appreciate c u l t u r e
look up normal boobs
the longer answer is that fake boobs are attached to fake women and these fake women are often idealized to what we like, making them innately more appealing than real boobs
that too
controversial opinion: i also do not understand the appeal of boobs that are big enough to generate significant gravitational fields of their own
boobs bring everyone together
also 99% of fake boobs dont work at all like real boobs. the defying of gravity is mesmerizing
i prefer concave chests myself
definitely.
what, contemplations of anatomical geometry?
what's the point of boobs you don't share
no. i was just drawing lol
no  never
can‚Äôt you like both?
butt
butt wasn't an option
i want pizza
lol what do you prefer panda
oh eyan
all the good things hurt you
i actually don't dragonite
this is all a figment of your imagination
i was gonna say all boobs, but rainy's answer works too
excuse me what the fuck
i know what i'm getting you for your birthday next year
<:rooderp:531156967943569410>
fixed it
izi pizi
i see there‚Äôs a party in vc or something
doubtful
i'm having a hard time, just me and booze
rofl
for my soul
still eatin tho
yeah, i do
define "doesn't look like it's from the ancient era"
sounds about right, dragonite
one step
crap im supposed to be cleaning my room brb
oh its a time limit, but i talk fast and its annoying
i just hated 99% of my classes
i cant write like anything
maybe. its a speech.
lucky
math. no. bad.
imma forget 90% of this speech
does your teacher spend like 45 minutes yammering about eye contact every single class too
people seem suprised by 500+ a lot
dont worry
arkada draw something else
i could, but i don't want to leave my other friends
<:roodab:509458870700212235>
wonder how much work it would be to make my own
you rang
hmmmmmmm
later nerds, i need to focus
my presence is a privilege
oh, so you just don't like me
eyan
to panda
rainy, come back
you guys still in vc
was just playing read dead when my xbox account randomly signed off, so the game restarted because i had to pick my account again and i have to replay a side quest. üòë
i wasted a lot of time tonight doing this
perv
hmmm
and i don't look as hot as sneaky yet, but i can dress up and look better than that
and my current xcom character honestly looks exactly like me
i had a pixie cut in 2015, haven't cut it since
but i'm gay
i would so go back to gay for her
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
coward
but i let them order
that's why i pick at their food
i just won't eat
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
noctis is adorable
attention?
that's hermamora
hmmmmmm
virgo that's it
whichever on you are
look bella it's nothing to be ashamed of
super good
amirite
the little mass-produced ones with memes on them and stuff
more like
but they ain't cause you're investment banking is boring and you are a coward
bella you didnt tell me you had a twin
better late than never i guess
there are things i should probably do but i dont feel like doing them
rainy dont be rude to the one who can have you decapitated
this makes me want to look up zodiac stuff instead of writing notes for my speech.
going to get food and probably sleep at a reasonable hour, eyan you should let rainy keep her head
go to bed you dumb fuck
i'll have you know my grandmother was killed by an astrology doubter
yes i am
ever
which will probably happen
go to bed eyan
of course i want attention
oh man
thanks for the reminder google
as in two days of me with my hair up working on essays all day at home, testing all day at school and forgetting to shower for once
game about the gays
it's a supernatural thriller
dumbass
i know c
what was it?
and hey, you love it
lime what?
this is from work
i make that specific reference all the fucking time
alright
but first
this is what i'm getting in a couple years
i'm not enough for you????
how dare you speak to me
fine, i'll leave then
oh good
wow you fucking would
ughh
you already left me
the motorcycle i want to get
did someone say... panda onesie?...
okay
oops
so really i'm just staring at my screen thinking about all the things i don't wanna think about
thunderdome ü§£
that's why i got 6 hours of sleep
good one
so tired...  v_v
eh, that's your problem then
it's less maintaining health and more shifting dependencies
good morning <:roohi:510305569475657740>
debatable
what is sarcasm?
i gotta work a short shift this afternoon
work
i‚Äôve just been playing red dead all morning
i'm gonna start streaming just so i can have this as my follow alert
eyan, let me post in black omen
free game
one of my actual faves
hmm tfw i can't get audio unless i use my capture card ~_~
but i just did a flawless up turnip up throw up smash combo
spiderman grapple and parkour mechanics, it's good
i am so fucking good at video games
wow rude
ironically enough, the one time i do a thief playthrough, i really haven't used much stealth archery
i never claimed it to be honorable, lol
cause i usually do beserker: alteration, two handed, light armor
i've done a fair number of nord playthroughs so usually two-handed, either light or heavy armor, block and then depending on the playthrough, ice magic, speech, enchanting, or maybe tossing in some one handed and block
what kind of warrior?
guys one of these days we need to tie master and candyman down to chairs and indoctrinate, i mean, re-educate, i mean, enlighten them
it's treason then
<:treason:396483914803445761>
9:27 am] king of zeal: i am a dumbass and rainy is too good for me.

i don't believe you
just so i can dress a cat
how close by do they walk?
i've got 10 minutes to become a pro at daisy
irl stream? <:oddonepog:509217203271499786>
install linux and then blame it
i'm proud of you dear
i'm not interested in losing
smash me
that i can do
nice
are you talking to the robot again?
yeah
see ya'll in a few
alright, going home
many stories are already known dumbass, that's why they're stories
oh boy, it's thursday, time for my weekly meal
you said a story
you thought his story was great?
i been busy working on a twitch/ discord emotes commission atm
ewww
but fried food makes me feel sick thinking about it
i just played adventures of captain spirit so im invested in the universe again. send help
i'd go there, but it's less than a mile away
the only things that that's really happened with are potter and skyrim (not even pok√©mon, despite how much of that i played in high school)
those are few and far in between
y'all entertain me, it's like a four mile walk
the almighty thanos whale... has arrived
but as long as it's an elder scrolls game i'll probably forgive it
hey panda can you post that kanna emote again
the almighty thanos whale has arrived!!!!!
but they are all valid
thanos beyblade
thanos laptop
best anime is big chungus.
it had me actually smiling.
you're not a full thot
let's just blow up the entire midwest tbh
but newvada
then we'd just have wyoming and not wyoming
foiled my plans
my life
play the song
no wait
why do i only hurt the people i love
no u
gottem
in my opinion bunny girl wasn't that great
it's fine to have a bad opinion
wait are you trying to send me to gulag for wrongthink?
i mean don't get me wrong i like anime. just not funny girl senpai
imagine if someone complained about being thirsty, and they had water easily available to them, and you tell them to go get some of that water, and then they don't, and they continue to complain about being thirsty.
have you considered being nice?
by that do you mean you will be nice to master and master alone, or do you mean you will be nice to master and literally not do anything else?
when people talk to each other, they never say what they mean. they say something else and you're expected to just know what they mean.
this body is older, but my residency in it is more recent.
gayest 7 year old i've ever seen

can confirm; i fall asleep best around 4 pm
i'm actually a pretty productive member of society all things considered
emptiness is the only truth of life
it was the weirdest thing ever
ignore dragonite he fuels bad habits
you can put meaning into it, if ya want, if you're into that kidna stuff.
that's not bragging that's doing a good job getting your life on track
whoa whoa, where's my invite?
trying things you haven't before is a good start.
gomp
i don't know
unfortunately it is
like not crash constan - oh wait it does that too
i just have a copy of photoshop from 2007 that i keep reusing the install code for over and over
it doesnt support animated png though which sucks
kind of what linus does in ltt
but with less words
i mean  i have made some shit in premier like that edit i made that i sent to the meme chat
and i like typing words
i quite liked pinnacle, but that was before i knew what true editing power was like
or at least i assume it was in like 2001
it was crap
the movie maker template titles you used to use at the beginning of your nsmb were legendary
no but really when i was 14 and had no idea how people cut video together and opened up movie maker for the first time, it was literally magical
so back then, movie maker quality was good enough to attract an audience
most of my problems were from me being stupid
and also it's honestly way more cutthroat at the bottom of the ladder (and the middle, and the top) and way less "hey let's have fun" now
same squid
(‚óï Œµ ‚óï)
you call me a dumbass
i honestly think i'm just gonna shoot to do my weekly series idea and any let's playing i do will be a side project for fun
~~i just don‚Äôt like most people~~
anything else i can explain for you, sweetheart?
it's not a conversation, it's me explaining to the dumbass
cause newsflash dumbass, be it one way or another, i like you, i don't call people i don't like dumbass
it's just not particularly my style to call somebody i find endearing a "dumbass" lol
oh, i know it's your style, thus why i didn't take it as a downright insult, lol
it just doesn't really work well on me
but i can respect that, so just know, that i'll never mean it spitefully, only endearingly, and i'll cut back on usage in which it could be construed negatively
angela did plenty of playful banter with me that i was cool with.  the problem she struggled with was when i wasn't in the mood and she upset me, she took it personally.  / shrug
i can do playful banter to an extent, but if i'm not in the mood for it or not particularly prepared for it, i can read it the wrong way
i hope all of your depression is smited away
which is the perfect message for the new guy to see upon joing the server
eyan you free this saturday?
oh good
welcome, have a baconator üçî
how are you today?
ahh yes
if one's not in the mood, we just cool it and support instead
i would probably just let them know in a normal way that i didnt like that joke
feels weird when you use that abbreviation
my personal issue with that
but let me post something in blackomen
i only need it for a minute
~~cause i'm real good at sucking dick~~
are you a hot single in eyan's area?
beat me to it
can i take her place
i'm sure i could make myself hot
i count anything within one states distance "my area" with the exception of upstate new york
eyan very much rigidly defined everyone's perms on blackomen
but you know me
previews on
jesus
in more ways than one
someone else took care of that
pretty sure i'm the only one from new jersey
no but i've taught him all the memes so he could probably convince people that he is
hd supply can burn in hell
i refuse to be upstaged by ninja bartender
holy crap, the bot gave a very real response, lol
nutter, tell me a bit about yourself, are you nuts?  do you like eating nuts?  do you...  eh, i'll resist making inappropriate jokes for now
i am truly inspired by your words nutter
respectable
uh, not really
that's about the best way to put it.
he's probably got one of the less accented skyrim voices
i can hear him say the line in my head though, lol
where i live, we say yinz
where are you from by the by
five what
oooh, you're from across the pond
here
off to a real life ceilidh in a few minutes with an american friend
something something 52!
also from pennsylvania as it happens
although she still claims to have won the superbowl
why do people not like philly again
i speak from a sports perspective
pretty tame if you ask me
but i don't have actual proof of that one
you weren't alive in 1994
well
status update grandma hates that the calculator i pulled up has trig functions and wants a more simple one
we live in a society
1990s: "we dont have enough features, add more"
2010s: "we have too may features, get rid of something"
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
alright, but you have to feed me as well
but italian is probably safe
what kind of food do you like?
i've cooked for many picky friends and partners
it's no secret i'm picky
and i love spicy, but i'm good at preparing food so it's mild and goes well with variable hot sauces
or at least it is for me now
and i'm a good cook
also a baker
i had a friend who wouldn't eat anything with any form of tomato in it at all, and italian is my specialty
but that's the fun <:gwaobapepecry:395628671911854081>
we're not friends anymore
which one
good
actually that's not true once i made this thing with chicken that came out okay. what was it called? i have no idea. how did i make it? i have no idea.
because if you don't bake your pasta you can go to hell
lmao
<:gwoicfidgetthinker:390299944910848000>
i think i just burned myself
historically people have needed far few reasons to do things than they have to not do things
am i in trouble
a squid walks into a bar.
so the correct wording would be "a squid _squelches_ into a bar"
i can imagine
i don't know what i want to do right now
thanks
isn't that what you want me to do?
i never said i objected
uhhhhhhhh
otherwise it gets kinda illegal, lol
right now, doing you is probably what would make me most happy right now, lol
and i find your vocabulary and sentence structure equally as charming
well i find your frequently retroactive tact entirely amusing and charming
also furret are just under two meters long
sounds hot
just realized baro is probably in town
that's what a koffing is for
glaceon is best though
i liked rosalia but couldn't catch them because i had emerald, but then 4th gen happened and oh god did i love roserade
restore health in hail rather
yeah, i only know the 4th gen meta, lol
of course, as a trainer, steel types are obviously my favorite
gardevoir is pretty nice
it's starts to get muddled after what i listed off
to show you
i totally might not
ice body restore health in rain
although i do reallly like milotic, easily in my top ten
primarina's nice but rowlett can move its face independantly of its head
he said jpg not jpeg
perfect
i got distracted
i like mismagius more than honchcrow
purple things
more jpeg as ordered
it's probably an odd fetish of mine, but damn do wedding dresses get me going
out of like. what 700 now?
and then i shall be in pittsburgh in 27 hours and we will be watching rwby
i always liked weiss
i just know that i'd supposedly love the scythe girl
spooky
qrow is better
i want one
does amazing rwby art
one sec
also
i also like this one
dragon doesnt have a good matchup against steel anyway
the usual
i was lied to
whats that
gladly
so even he doesn't know
define normal?
understandable
oh, i have a good folder system, don't worry
well, iris heart did
if we're posting art
not plutia
fit for posting
rainy why do you do this to me
post it anyways
look
i heard something about birdbox(?)
my art folder was out of sfw stuff anyways
last village is already gone
also, i didn't know i could get more attractive either
ironically the smash censorship was a blessing for less than sfw images of mythra
i mean yeah that too
there are other security measures
fukc
realmaster, i am hurt that you think that way of me
pay up
but that‚Äôs effort
i liked peach back in brawl, she was probably like, maybe my 4-5 that i'd occasionally play when i was bored of my mains
that's actually pretty cool
daisy is my current smash main
but gay
please if i'm stupid then that would make everyone else
even more dumb if i'm being honest
terraria is a game i really really really want to actually muddle through solo, but friends just make it a lot more fun
now i get to say bowser is hot without getting weird looks in public
i just like this artist's style a lot
smug dead inside zelda is me
okay, but in game if mario doesn't touch a flag or axe every 500 seconds he dies
i don‚Äôt like rushing
wanna bet rainy?
can't hear you
i don't even know what you are trying to say
or are you talking about smash?
yeah, more or less
and the 3d games where there's a timer
i kind of need her alive
what im trying to say is theyre not the most rational of people
but people can "progress" like, 3 bosses worth of gameplay in an hour or two if they move quickly so if you decide to build a nice home, suddenly, you're playing catch up or just being gifted gear upgrades
i mean, you can be my current one if you want
we never said that he was rational with this
but somebody changed their name, lol
what is my corpse supposed to turn into a furret?
i'm gonna say it's short for babylon
i'll stream after i eat which is right now, bbl
if i'm to be a furret i better learn surf and headbutt
but that's just me
oh it's not you
i'll just turn you into my hm slave with cut only.
maybe 12?
or be choked, i'm not picky
well still, either way agitation falls under that category
and no 9k, i prefer the latter, but it's all about the participlants
that's up to you though
i should probably join stream but i'm listening to someone play jurassic park music on the french horn
why is my life so complicated
but french horns
i‚Äôm busy catching up on the youtube videos that i missed while at work. or maybe playing more red dead
a healthy dose of steel alloy a day keeps the doctor away
i looked up the simpsons rating
wait why isnt eyan streaming?
shut up
before streaming
he never finishes
odd technique but ok
its okay theres more quality content to watch
if you don't the universe will explode
babe
eyan
told you to stream
baby
lmfao
delet
nice
give me two minutes
for you rainy, i suppose i shall
stop
do i get to say a catchy one liner before the delet
candy cease
mr stark
delet you
or every other person in both
or every fourth person in all four
wait
honestly getting kicked in the vagina is pretty painful <:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
so you can call me daddy?
this is a very complicated family tree
if candy gets to be thanos
yeah
that
scarlet witch
nice
how did i do that
cause she's a bad bitch
wait
that parts important
and she dies
!skram
i am happy af
if  you could follow my twitch that would be greatly appreciated üòÑ
is that like a handicap for "playing without normal metabolic process" or something
just go to the arctic circle
sounds like a terrible design decision
keep speaking like  tierzoo and im gonna flick your nose
food for thought
pretty sure living on your own is adopting yourself
actually just gonna start smacking your nose with a newspaper like a dog
higher damage but with some recoil if you're not wearing a glove
alright back to streaming
but fuck i'm cute when i put effort into how i look
tho buying the expansions after getting the base game doesn't extend that time
people keep telling me i should play ff14
i should definitely give the trial version a go though, my mmo experience is limited to like a half hour of eso and most of that was me going "wow there are a lot of buttons i can press"
your hotbars get overwhelmed
well ffxiv starts off with few buttons
more storage devices
i was told
sigh
whalecum
boop
and that's on top of all the backlog i had from last week, lol
well then.
you're not wrong, i generally learned better off on my own, problem was, i'd just cream, lol
4 minutes into the new stephen & friends: gta online episode, and i'm already loving every second of it
luckily my school was all right with that but i wasn't gonna worry about it either way
why am i seeing ads for bras
i saw it earlier; it‚Äôs pretty good
listen mate thighs are god's gift to us and no one can convince me otherwise
~~do you have interest in cross dressing?~~
why not
maybe google is mocking me
(‚ïØ¬∞–¥¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ /(.‚ñ° . \\)
screw you too google
be like general grievous
follow his example.
y pose...
or it just looks cool
going to take a wild guess that this is a "no"
i would gladly take a subreddit full of cat gifs right now
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
that‚Äôs what happens when eyan needs energy
sup bitches, your queen graces you with her presence
~~they are if you know they have a dick and you want them because of that~~
humor him
no like server powers, just like, people, and deleting them
skarm you're only three years old
case in point.
go for it.  üòõ
hopefully it'll be smoother sailing from there.
who needs deleting?
im not really in a bad mood it twas just a goof
ah yea, i think you'll be just fine though man youre friggin draco
sounds good
and yea i can def relate. i mean im not in full on college, im only taking one course but it's intimidating as all hell
look at you nerd and your...job. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
mine are 8 weeks instead of 15 for examples.
i‚Äôm getting ready to do nothing and relax until i gotta go work a closing shift
true that
which is totally fine by me
hmm.
anxiety or something?
probably, draco
welcome
what's a paladin
weeb
fight fight fight
i will end the world
you have my word
well now you're just being picky
way to stay optimistic
it's always been my dream to be killed by candy
candy do you own terraria?
gotta negotiate a place then too
10 paces, not ten steps
and much as i want to die, i live to please
relatable
10 paces
preach
terraria
verbal agreements are binding if either party starts to act on it
why tf
porque no los dos?
i puke it up shortly after
beef is gross
so yeah
meat is great
rainy you home?
hmmm
no rainy
nobody is fucking hillary
they fucked a politician on twitch even though they get mad at cursing?
i need to make food
but what do i make
help
burg
i really need to get majoras mask 3d
pasta
hill[]
depends on what would be on the burger but likely burger
now 9k, you may ask me, did i just spend the last of my plat on being pink?
if you don't kill/die looking good, what's the point.
i miss her
this lesson doesnt look that long and it looks super interesting
if my view of the course is correct i'll be nearly 2 - 3 chapters ahead
is there like a clean version or something that seems like it would be a common kind of survey to make
they have most of high rock in it and it's pretty likely that that's where es6 is taking place
also hai draco and xeon
i just like palutena
and i've been on a metroid kick lately and ridley's actually good
can't really say for 4, because i didn't get the dlc for that one
i've been having a lot of fun with lucas
i just enjoy the kit
pk flash/freeze - freeze looks cooler
pk thunder - lucas's goes through people
pk fire - knockback on lucas, wall of fire on ness. personally prefer the knockback
psi magnet - the one ability that i actually prefer on ness
also, full disclosure, i picked palutena because i like thighs
top 10 photos taken seconds before disaster
uh ok
that won't help
does it ever strike you how odd the naming of final fantasy x-2 is
nope
final fantasy 100
i can confirm this
super mario land 2 comes after super mario bros 3
oh u rite
what does that even mean
god fucking bless
bloodthirster also has +3 to both attack and damage rolls

speedrunning marathon for charity

i enjoy speedruns, particularly the mario and zelda ones
it was never my intent to deceive
so, rainy's evil, and she doesn't have laziness holding us back
but gluttony counters pride, and sloth counters avarice, and those two sins are me summed up, so i've no time for the others
lol, literally just saw that tweet
a lot of people we hate are the people we realize we have stuff in common with
pretty accurate

i should also head to bed
interesting lol
~~kingofskarmory.~~
i keep thinking about my weekly series idea, i really want to do it, lol
pretty much
work isn't really supposed to be fun, lol
would somebody who is flawless choose to be with a lesser being who isn't flawless?
yeah but- dammit
lmaooo
pity
mind killing me?
i won't be dying for the next several thousand years, so i would prefer to spend less of it feeling lonely.
also good morning darling, and the rest of you lot
eh, details
i always feel like i scare people off when i'm here
my current setup is an scourge aasimar  fighter (gunslinger) level 6 and i'm planning on taking some levels in wizard for some illusion and defensive spells

time to play skyrim... when i get home...
have you tried mountains?
bring a laptop with you for low work days or when it's snowing
also, we're not understaffed, we just value actually working at work, sort of

glad someone else gets it
and why do you even _own_ that many pencils

i like how dragonite says nothing about the 3ds in that photo
wait a minute i can just slap him in the face and be satisfied with that
i mean, don't get me wrong, she, is hot
yup, gen 5 is best
okay, but look her up on the internet
sure
eh w/e
ok i have a better solution
but the generation as a whole
nvm, you're good then
that too
cats are the solution
cats
they should have made cynthia playable in dppt then gen 4 would have been objectively the best
it was an honest question
guns? are you playing the mtg version?
yeah so we just got up and left
currently replaying the original version of bowser's inside story
my kitty, ryu
eyan dont _all_ of your exes have cats
3 if you count the stray that collette looked after for a while, but it wasn't her cat by any means
aren't you clocking out in like 4 mins
katia, max
yup üòÅ
also, very true drago ^^
i was told we have a criminal here, come out with your hands up <:gwowokannagun:358278230341320706>
i literally have a curtain of the things cascading down from a hook on my closet door
good point
buy a new webcam: not working
i apparently have wisdom teeth. i also learned what wisdom teeth are today
wisdom teeth are great
i have to disagree that gluttony should be lower since i rarely eat
theyre totally pointless and take you out for like eight whole days when they have to dig them out
im not gonna bother getting it removed
imoutos are sisters, dragonite.
everything is ouch and the getting rid of the ouch makes other things ouch harder
ouch, literally
yeah pimaster
i‚Äôve never been in a relationship
neither have i
i need serious professional help.

i cant type ok
in regards to why my lust is low, its because i only really use sex for jokes

demon lord or me?
would you like a cookie?
if i did, i'd give myself cash fuckin money <:lul:528108303939665920>
i should totally flex now and take a picture while being in boots and uts to show how great statureous i am
you look like a man of great stature

sinner
i explained a physics problem in physics class like bob ross would and it made my physics teacher very happy
when did i become such a bitch
rainy it rained here last night, the rain froze the ground solid, then it snowed on top of that, and i got to drive home like that
"almost died so much fun"

christ it is cold out
that one was a bit real
what better time is there to join than the middle of a card game
can't i'm still listening to nier
the only one i understand is the second one from the bottom but i'm guessing some of them are memes that i don't want to know about
nice
does thinking traps are really really cute count as edgy
"traplover69420xx" wonder who that could be? /s
aww i'm out of cajun fries
i cant click on anything
would they?

sorry about that, drago
that's it for me, i think
shotgun knees
alright
does anyone know how long this meme has been alive? i'm pretty sure the installer said that when i first started using it in _2011_
good job
anybody wanna see a picture of me wearing a spartan helmet
i have class in two hours but should probably leave now because traffic
and you didn't invite me?
no i need to have 3 wisdom taken out with two of them being fully impacted and the other being partial erupted and it makes me wanna die and then my eye surgery
<:doit:334014889137930240>
i'll go to war with it
its a win win
funny meme
is that innuendo
i'm sorry, is this the part where i should be laughing in amusement?
hey did yall know that japanese honeybees kill hornets by enclosing them in a ball of bees and vibrating at a frequency so fast that it cooks the hornet to 115f/42c?
i knew that some bees did that but not japanese honeybees exclusively
wait it is?

i work at wal-mart so i don't have a problem walking in there
you work at  walmart? my condolences...
it's not that bad honestly
the one i work at at least isn't that bad
i worked there for a while and the other people who worked there were literally the best part about it, which is not something the other places i've worked can say
where i work, most of my coworkers are good; it‚Äôs the customers and the repetitiveness of the job that get to me
there was one time where a family of about 10-12 mexicans came into the store just to use the bathroom. this also happened with an indian family, except they bought a cake
and somehow the computer locked up and voided the whole thing
skarm has this way of being oddly relevant to the conversation

i would say same but i'm not here often enough
2 shots 1 cavity filled and 0 exams, fun day
there we go
sounds like it

demon is that special type of normal where he's 'normal' with a bit of 'weird' but not too weird and must be protected at all costs
i'd pick the bible on that one
but raptors
i picked the first one
bella you need to be less normal
i'm normal <:gwahreeweebrage:370265985787101187>
likes cats is normal, college is almost too normal, going out on weekends is normal, having a shit job to pay for college is normal
it's gir
but on the bright side it's way cooler and moreinteresting

who would the other two be?
panda what the crap is that in your icon
i feel like some people here need some dopamine.
i'm not sorry
that's so much better

actually quite the contrary, i'm trying to have something that resembles a life, lol
i'll have you know that i am a professional
be sure to not get a paper cut on your tongue
that's not _their_ fault!
look, i wish i was created smarter, sexier, and maybe another inch or two taller, but i wasn't
there‚Äôs a lot of people around here who are 6 feet tall and around 5 feet tall with not much in between
that would be dope...amine
<:kappapride:379352530863521792>
yeah, blow me
i should sleep
are you sure it's not co?
i should stream
with my dying breath i cut the rope and exclaim "y'all fucking heathens gonna die in shame"
i object on the basis of context

sounds about right
oh cool it even gave february the right number of days in a leap year
i have sheets for mobile installed and it's about as fun as poking myself in the eye with a nuclear bomb that's in the middle of detonating
how big are they compressed (as xlsx)?
all the pages are in one xlsx
although they should've honestly just gave it to retro in the first place
were you just trying to break sheets or something

i'll take that as a yes

holy crap that's a nice build
its from reddit
well i fucked that one up

so your only child
nice
congrats
the laser gun thing was admittedly kind of cool
i recently started playing botw and i rememberd my old love for oot
then from there i found the current twitch
and i did it by sweeping wallace with a weezing.
funny how that plays out
excuse me what
press f to slap you with a fish
grace hopper, tim sweeny and dennis ritchie are probably next
update: t=+7 days and weight of the world has still been on loop on my computer almost nonstop
nobody knows what a pokemon is squid, you made it up
yeah
how am i a... oh right. my avatar
if so it should be spelled "pogey"
it is indeed nice, you dont have to shovel
go giratina
abandon ship and the degree
alternatively you dont have the drive to actually get shit done of in class deadlines
each of them have their respective advantages and disadvantages.
so i don't take his opinion into account too much
i think to some extent it also just depends on the person
im also an independent learned but i have a problem with stress and overthinking every little thing
for me it depends ont he subject
i need to do hands on brain surgery/analysis
oh, skarm~
oh that highligher for ctrl f is quite the abomination upon the eyes
it used webassign which i was scared at first because i've heard bad things about webassign, but it wasnt bad actually, and it accepted all of my answers perfectly which is nice
eyan you're awesome
~~it is?~~
it took me nearly 2 hours to complete 21 problems, about an hour and a half i'd say, so that's a lot of work but it seems manageable
welp, time to wait 6 hours for my game to update, i think the cold might somehow be affecting my internet
epic
that is entirely correct
blame english, not me
discussion posts that is
this is relevant
deathly cold today, supposed to be in the 20s to 40s for the rest of the week. yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
but if you don't argue are you really learning? <:gwqlabsmmlol:398950702505918478>
good job
math lol
oooh i wanna join
maybe you, skarm?
look, eyan
well yes, if i wanted to just kill
just don't post the crashing gif and things should be fine, rainy.
i prefer the shorter and thinner ones for that
precisely candy
hai friends ^w^
large knives, i've gotten that much figured out
you can make your own fun in that situation
and only now just realized that i can buy art books
insubordination!
i'd say that's about 1.35 cats for the price of one
yooooo i finally solved a problem on my calc challenge problems which means im done finally...that took a few hours
well not entirely but i'd only bought like five of them mostly out of boredom but still
what do you mean in drago's dream? eyan is so famous
i've got a new pet peeve
like it's the end of week 4 and some rando student just asked me "so what are we doing?"
when anyone from my school asks me shit like "so what did we do this week in english?" because they skipped every class
at least in chemistry,
the only walkthroughs i havent watched
let's make a correction, i did go in 2017, he just didn't see me there, lol
i missed 2017
you were at thrown controllers in 2018 though right? that means there was at least one point where i was at most 150 feet away from you and didnt see you
well math, not kugal
i was invited to the phi theta kappa society at my cc today and i know little to nothing about it but apparently it's becausse of all the maths i've done
i can't believe you found the mud block
i could google it
what would i be reincarnated as
don't worry, he'll be going to the next one
i could also not google it
ehhhhhhhhhhh
im such a proud parent
they basically just offer and encourage scholarships for the most part
plus im young and i think they have like an age limit on it probably
i should probably go shower, later folks
have fun
whenever i tell my friend im about to shower he says "stay safe, be smart, have fun, keep your eyes on the prize" and that is just too underrated
don't worry i just made a terrible joke
being a 2000s kid has it perks xd
say godnight, skarm
or dont
maybe he's saying you go out and put your computer down
night night skarm
i should probably sleep
you know what i just realized? pretty much all languages that support casting floats to strings (so all of them) round the value
but then how would we get memes like 5 / 3 * 3 != 5
tried out that windirstat thing, and to the surprise of nobody
uhhh
i guess not
ok so
that was a great choice to star him
at worlds end
i was watching the super bowl just like 99.9% of humanity,
they use dialog thats a little different and change the visuals so they arent spoilery
im so out of the loop on avengers
>watching superbowl like 99.9% of humanity
last movie i saw by marvel period was spider man homecoming
the game just boils down to the patriots vs. whoever's playing the patriots
by the way rc im 50+ hours into xenoblade and figured out what chain attacks do
something like that
well theres 7 billion people
everyone always knew that
so then 30 of .3 is like .09 which might as well be .1
kugal why is there a d in fridge but no d in refrigerator
the fridge likes the d? <:kappapride:379352530863521792>
i don‚Äôt think so
nice
~~no, the individual. you d-nglehead~~
i wonder when the next time i get like a day off is
if i decide not to take diff. equations and calc 3 at the same time, which should i take first
just be sure to keep pace with your physics courses too
in a way, diff. equations is *kinda* a calc 4? except not really
not at this cc
then sometime after that is like trig-sub and partial fractions which i spent my whole winter break practicing so im not too worried on my performance on that
momentum, that shit was fun
exactly
parametric derivatives were simple enough, but something tells me parametric integration is gonna get messy
also my paraoia is off the charts high
your weeks 1 and 2 are what we're doing right now
so i spent like 2 whole pages explaining everything in detail and showed every goddamn step
i understand sportsball now
why am i not surprised at the result of the game?
actually most of them were kind of meh
to anyone who knows touhou super well, wasn't there a song called "blinding new"?
theyre not as bad as like english or something but like it's not code
<:doit:334014889137930240>
i've never had beef dumplings *kugal said, surprising no one*
also, without listening to what i linked, i'm strongly guessing it to be based on either "a soul as red as a ground cherry" or "apparitions stalk the night"
those two songs are two of my more favorite touhou songs, that's why i know them and a lot of their remixes well.  probably just cause of nostalgia since that was more or less how i started playing touhou
for me, it's "mystic dream ~ snow or cherry petal" and "paradise ~ deep mountain".  thanks to you even.
one day i will
i'd like to get back to streaming skyrim this week
ive been living and dreaming about xenoblade for the last six days
impressive
my calc ii grade is at 105% so im like in heaven
well, i was talking more on the lines of mario 3.
and i haven't even gotten to ice world yet as well
maybe if i see an extra on the store shelves in the future, i'll get it and subsequently mod it to add tetris attack and more.
i want something.
i want schools using memes.
drawing
music or drawing?
okay, somehow managed to get almost 13 seconds against piston hurricane on super punch-out
she'll be okay with it
and yeah, the fan community is insane in what it has produced.
reasons to marry me. gym membership, free medical, free dental, free life insurance, free house
flex seal has sealed memes
well a 30lb clock will do that to it
you should let it fall from a great height and clock you on the head
bad news is my files might be fucked and so ill be completely left in the dust for school work/progress
while i get a new computer im using a computer connected to a huge 4k tv as the monitor
i much more prefer it to be colder
i've never had jimmy johns
get yo shit together
i love how last week nc was 12 degrees and freezing rain and now 85 and sunny
heelies do sound like a huge liability in a military situation
my mind auto-corrected it
that's my point
oh wait that's not what i said
or you're just late at waking me
what is that?
~~pinning the blame on drago, are we~~
last september ended a long time ago ida
well then wait for the next one, jeez drago
it appears not.
i don't know what age these girls are supp - wait
that was an interesting conversation üòÇ
only the finest conversations here ‚òï
even he agrees
haha, sure, but after this one xd
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
even if they'll probably need a bit of help to sustain it
i'm starting to wonder if literally having a cheaper cpu than my mom's computer might be a bad idea
king dipshit
i enjoy the way my computer basically locks up when i'm trying to do things like export a video
idk acts are ass anyways
i just asked and my homeroom teacher said that wasnt true
humor me okay
hmmm
exactly skarm
i'm always here...always watching o.o
greetings, eyan.
never mind
it'd just be trollier on april fools because nobody will believe it, lol
even if i don't do an "april fools" trailer, i will still do the trailer i want to do either way
i don't think i'm making that deadline
but i had to have too much "delay" between the trailer and return
never mind, stream is cancelled
eyan if you don't stream on friday, i will cry.
the hard part is getting started, and staying started, if i get past that bump, i'll be rolling
eyan, are you tugging heartstrings again? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
okay
he wouldn't even cuddle me last night, the heartless bastard.
usually
mainly based on the sound logic and reasoning of, you're nowhere near me
emotions are annoying
sadly
and i'm sleep deprived as shit
same
you just want to enjoy the meal
so, a squid can have more <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i don't feel functional though
i think coffee is the only reason i‚Äôm not useless right now.
i'm sure coffee is to some degree effective, but i fear becoming dependent of it, and i really just don't want to add an expensive habit to my list of expenses for something that can be fixed other ways, like just sleeping more
my typical sleep seems to be 13 hours
i‚Äôve got a class coming up where my prof is just nonstop talking at us... so u don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôll go
kind of like drinking  üòõ
does anyone know if there's a beverage that will give me an irresistible desire to do my homework
tell me when you do
i have, however, been known to sleep right through them while i'm there
i could get away with it though, because again, good at self-study
you aren't wrong, but there's this thing called your "degree" that is important to show off
i never really felt compelled to go on the internet during class, despite the fact that most of them so far have been in computer labs
unless it‚Äôs one of those rare classes, people just zone out
at this point, i'm probably better off just having some fun with a fresh start and if it doesn't go anywhere, at least i can say i gave it one last try
it's such a struggle.  >_<  but at least i'm back to not waking up miserable and depressed every day again, i recovered semi-quickly imo from the events of december
as for going back and giving my past self advise, i honestly don't think i could give myself any advise that would help
what‚Äôs outdoors?
yeah i guess
some of us have weird hobbies okay
master was mostly wrath sloth and pride
or i could be wasting time on discord
i mean
i decided this was a worthy use of my time once
my favorite google translate tip has to be switching the language 50 umpteen million times before switching it to english
hmmm
what if instead of eyan having the bob ross mod or learning how to do it himself, he got a sound board which he could use for every single bob ross phrase and word for the videos
that sounds like what your graduating project would be
although it'd be ironic if uninstalling reinstalling it worked
i'm here to learn not fuck up my internals more than my computer already does
dragonite
yeah me too
oh right i should do that
that's less fun though
i'm going to take all that youve done and make it as spaghetti as possible
it's not that hard in sinnoh tbh
there aren't really *that* many spaces in the room you can find it
master why is your google name argothenaut
mom discovered cat videos today
just like life
is that your celebration for cracking three thousand lines of spaghetti skarm
why not?
ok then
does it only work for you and rainy because if it's anything like the back counter it's probably going to get trolled
e!drink
everyone else can do e!drink
e!drink1
e!drink
my new favorite file extension
pretty sure strings are truthy as are positive integers so it would just return true anyway
skarm bugger off
at least you seem to be somewhat trying
you go through four long routes, a cave, fight team magma, all just to get to the gym
anyways, that's just what i can think of off the top of my head without watching the video
yeah i was gonna mention that
yeah
the gap between candice and volkner are fine because you fight team galactic
for example, i found the gap i mentioned is just boring, even with one team flare battle
a lot of the gap between 6 and 7 is just traversing the snow routes and fighting two fights with the commanders that really should've been separated more
i feel like i could put out a part to an lp each day off or days where i don‚Äôt work until late afternoon, but i‚Äôm lazy and i like not doing work on days off. so...
i enjoy just working my way through the game working on the pokedex and having a cool team
most creative i've been able to get is teaching thunderpunch and thunder fang to my gallade and gliscor respectively
i've stopped giving a shit about making a cohesive team
2 of my pokemon are 4x weak to ice and one of em is 2x weak
exp share plus anything that can learn fire type moves
in my playthroughs i always like using the same pok√©mon as the rival character
eyan you can also be the biggest les - there is no way for me to salvage this sentence is there
actually i've got nothing
only cowards aren't lesbians.
thank you mr burnham
having self respect is for losers
i'm a guy who likes girls does that count or am i a coward too
hahahahahahahaha no
ok but have you tried exoblade?
that sounds like a bionicle or yugioh thing
do your eyes feel like that?
how long has it been since surgery?
because everyone is better than me
"if you want a grass team, start by considering your horrible life choices"
im amazed that people still play or plan to play plat
platinum is great shut up
they were both at the same levels in diamond and pearl, right?
no clue
d/p then
meylene's lucario was 32
yeah. although, i just battled koga and his team in yellow was really fucking stupid
but you can do 5-7 in any order
3 venonat and 1 venomoth
and for some reason pryce's pokemon are lower level than jasmine's
i at least assume they want you to at least be in your late 30s given the fact that clair's kingdra is level 41
that's with clair
lemme check real quick
i have the page right now
where the hell did you catch an electabuzz
also, i remember being far higher leveled than that
i wish i still had my pokewalker
actually, that's a lie
still wish i had one.
may be smart.
what's up gamers
greetings.
i just say ‚Äúalex‚Äù <:kappa:374346980136058893>
whys this in algetty?
why not just be alloy then?
the x is silent
that sounds like an organization xiii name or something.
yeah, that's the name of the secret-secret fifteenth member of the organization
and that's no. xvi, who's also their janitor
if there's an x in their name that is pronounced, they're part of the organization
lads
i thought i shared this important piece of culture already, huh
not to be confused with xxx the rating, or xxx, vin diesel's popular action hero character.
i accidentally put

welcome
someone help i'm cold and borex
somehow i read that as "i'm cold and a board"
so 3 for the price of 1
didn't he get arrested for a dui
youtube keeps showing adds for apps that look like softcore hentai games or something. and they say they‚Äôre trying to make the website more family friendly...
i'm sure you all have some very interesting theories about that
it's snowing but at the same time sunny
it's probably going to be my 2019 goty since i don't think pokemon can impress me at all compared to this xd
good choice
i believe it's called sun and moon
in other news i can now say i'm fly bi and ready to die
my favorite game is a 3 way tie between chrono trigger, xenoblade, and pokemon gen 4
fuckin cute ass traps.
well pretty sure you can beat it with your fists
diamond is slightly more nostalgic to me, since it was the first pok√©mon game i beat. but i can‚Äôt play it over platinum, with how slow it is
yo 9k, lemme get a "this close to greatness"
every issue i've had with it aside from pacing issues that plague every pokemon game can be fixed by just developing it on better hardware
being ~~sick as~~ an adult sucks
btw i'm alive
yeah
ftfy
sick as an adult is worse... college and work aren‚Äôt as easy to lose a day or more on. fun fun
my favorite part about that is that it comes up immediately if you google anime galatians 4 16
congrats
the question is do i want to do school over the summer again
i get death
what about what i may say
partly that, and also ocd is really starting to hate me for not winning the 100cc cups.
or something
that was fun
if you feel like doing more with this, maybe increase the one handed skill of known owners of the books

having a stable economy
don't you have to get into a fistfight with haelga though? that would be one-handed
so that takes care of that
hell of a meme, candy
sleep
i'm allergic to that particular variety of not-dragon
good pin
that's life
rainy gets it
rainy you are under arrest for masterhackering without a license
i object orient
please shoot me in the fucking head
farcry new dawn let's me have a cybernetic arm, game of the year
dude he has the dialga stone thing of course it's instant
so there's a bunch of pcmr people who inhabit the computer lab and theyve been getting progressively noisier and i finally complained about them to the tech support desk
thats dumb
africa's only like six or seven hours ahead though so if it happened late afternoon it might still work
these stones suck
unrelated but managing the main branch of git seems slightly wrong at times
that means not rolling math.random() >.5 ) for each person in the population at once but rather exponentially doing so for each species from the point of origin
huh so your math wasnt wrong
fortunately he doesn't use them too much.
>twice
uhhh
i need somebody to explain 39 degree snow to me
ida why are you still awake
grade average
that's how i ended up with a 106 in precalculus the one semester they rounded my grade down to 100
and i did it in like two days because i don't have anything to do
they're int he process of adding it so, if they could make it downright available that'd be dope
they offer that here. i was supposed to take that at some point üòå
old indeed.
didn't know stanley was part of this server
aqua the picture says platinum not heartgold
does it have a recurring reminder feature?
except for the part where it was rounded down
what about soulsilver drago
i see
yo candy
i am looking at the memes
is this the birth of a meme?
people really went crazy.
i have no idea when i beat chrono trigger btw
hi good morning if i had to see this shit you do too
all my friends do, though.
~~can you tell i‚Äôm a little bit envious lmao~~
school has made me realize how much you have to put out there for upkeep with friends. it‚Äôs really tough
nothing wrong with being envious, as i am generally envious of all of you guys.  i feel like an old man now, lol
don't get me wrong demon_lord, honestly, being an adult is nice
i have that
most of my stress i put on myself.  it comes from a place of thinking i should be something more than i currently am.
nah that's understandable
i don't think i ever really "had it together" but it at least felt like it back in high school and early college, lol
oh kugal, you're funny
the part ic ant wait to enjoy as an adult is the not talkign to people you dont wanna talk to part
in terms of family though you're right kugal, and trust me, i know a thing or two about that
guys wanna hear a funny story
for god's sake don't pin the evidence too
you set your expectations of us just a wee bit too high
again, probably
at this point i'll need meth to do more math
this week im gonna join phi theta <:kappa:374346980136058893> wish me luck
i'm going to try to stream a bit this week, i'm currently eyeing up tomorrow
i've gotten really hung up on the question of "to rebrand or not to rebrand" again when it comes to youtube.
i'd say that's still a succes.
good
no way he's giving these puns a rest anytime soon
i don't know
i‚Äôll take that as a no
i feel like pain should be quadratic but momentum is usually used for interactions between bodies
or something
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
i feel like that would be force
calc ii midterm today, and im like totally not nervous at all. i feel like i'll crush it and last minute prep is goin well
i did bomb my calc midterm, i know the feeling.  üòõ
then a week later i got the grade and saw i got 97% and i was probably the happiest i've been since ever
eyan are you making fun of me
i also have my finances mostly organized too.  i just need to figure out the investing half of things.  >_<
muscle tone is just refining what's there, not actually gaining more.
i never plan to be some hardcore body builder, but just some light exercises here and there are better than nothing
we've been doign it since 1/7/19 and im at 1663 pushups total
draco, my friend, funny of you to think i have any muscle, lol
yeah, i agree, and there's too many little things i haven't done for far too long
i also starting drinking more water for a new years resolution, it was surprisingly easier to maintain and do every day than i thought it would
it's the little things, they make a lot of difference
i think you'll get there soon
what kind of hw
we all think our buds can do awesome shit but we think we're mediocre
you have more confidence than i, but i appreciate it.  üòõ
get back to work. üòõ
i have a bad feeling about this
and now no one‚Äôs here
greetings, aloix.
good luck friend
but once i hit 35 i'm gonna be a red mage
have fun
nah i went with the brad bread pun
wow same what a coincidence
that is alot of potatoes üëÄ ü•î
not sure what those are.
the gauges fill by casting spells associated with black and white mage respectively.
red mage can be seen as a mix of black mage and white mage but also has it's own unique mechanics.
twin vipers
it actually is the one with the rapier tho
that's kinda what i expected
given that i never use gil, neat.
i know the feeling all too well.
rainy is more keen on warframe and it's obviously 9ks bread and butter so i feel like it doesn't make sense for me to switch games when i primarily use online games to be social
i play on jenova in the aether data center for example.
sargatanas
i'm with the maelstrom btw
sorry, was typing quick cause my boss was walking over.  üòõ
xiv is an mmorpg, eyan. üòõ
~~rightfully so~~
~~nerds~~
~~so sorry~~
~~thanks friends~~
pretty sure i play on behemoth
~~i play on behemoth~~
~~that‚Äôs better~~
though we can't all pine for goth gfs
some of us must be the goth gfs
you didn't even give me a chance to respond
of something with little patience
because all men are like that, so i figured if i'd date a man it should probably be my favourite one.
e!drink 1
that‚Äôs actually a nice way to put it
i just want you to appreciate my eloquence, is that too much to ask for?
look, you don't have to be around me, lol
bite me
is it though?
you knew what you were getting into
peace with oblivion
we need to refractor the code then
rude
have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree and take to the air?
ida remind me where is it that you live
good job
~~wait, i already am one~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i'm out of tables to flip, do you have any i can borrow?
shooting the apple of the head?
yeah i want my butthole to suffer when i poop later
if you want
will you kill me afterwards?
it really pissed me off tbh
but i hold the apple in my mouth
actually if red meat is good for the soul that explains a lot
again
red meat is amazing for the soul
rare or mr
yeah but anyway...
like sucking?
indeed it did, my youtube stuff hasn't gone as planned so i want to hop back into streaming while i continue to pull myself together.
personally, i prefer medium well
ü§î hmmmmm
i mean
me_irl
oh yeah, isn't that fangame called flames of eternity?
steven is second best
cynthia is hot *and* cool
to be fair steven deals in metal so he can probably change temperature real easily
hindsight okay?
she deserves the love of every man and woman on earth.
look
anyways i take it you're subbed to the temple of mythra
god damn it i wanted to post that here
hey :( i'm an adult :(
yes but he collects rocks
it's fun to say
i'm going to be 25 next month
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
wait actually
it won't allow me to update or uninstall anything.
i hear it works great
brb making one of these
takes one to know one
google is a friend
xkcd and singing
you're god damn right
i'm bored and my boyfriend went to bed
who the hell is argo
replacing aids with depression is new to me tho
aqua i answered b for all of them except for the one my mouse slipped and hit c on and i think that was the only one i got right
and when i hit finish
damn it idas was too hard to maintain balance
i consider a 4 on demon lords a win.  üòõ
who are you
ida's is the only one i scored higher than a 4 on, out of like 8 or 9 quizzes total
i made one a little bit ago, mine should actually be semi-reasonable to do okay on.  üòõ
there's really only two questions that are total crap shoots, the rest of them should be feasibly answerable questions.  the first and last being crap shoots unless you're a really really old school fan of mine
i don‚Äôt know eyan as well as i thought i did
i figured "chrono trigger, zeal, makes sense
thanks eyan lol
got a 6 on ‚Äúmr spam‚Äù
everybody i looked at picked the same person on the ssseven question
i can't believe how everyone is picking the same answer on the ssseven question.  i can't tell if that means you all  recognize the other 6 names and not the one or if it's mere coincidence
mine were actually fair but tricky
why do you people have to start talking when i have class in two minutes
i think i actually missed that one becaouse i didn't even recognize the one i got wrong
the guy that everybody is answering was probably the only real artist i ever had who helped me out long term.  üòõ
they're all real people btw
probably cause we recognize the others
that's
he got one of his own questions wrong
i missed so many question by 1 option i was guessing lmao
good job kugal
you are my best friends
doesn't surprise i'd fall for the bait lmao
it's not a good website, lol
ok i don‚Äôt know you but i‚Äôm 102% sure that you‚Äôre not an idiot üòÇ
you'd be surprised
btw, welcome aura, lol
so none of the above is correct?
at least i remembered that
i think i actually selected that
so every one has gotten the high one wrong
nothing to worry about
well i‚Äôm sure my intelligence is below average
though i might just be below average and stupid so
i took a quiz here by accident once
i think i did the best on drago's lmao, he made it easy though
why did my brain start playing the star wars theme when superman was mentioned
wow now if only that was the case with school
sounds lovely.
thanks auto-correct
inventory was 8:30
well, i woke up at 5.  üòõ
shocker, i know
debatable
peace
wow thanks
this is an interesting bot
wait
wow rood
screw you too skarrm
i birthed him by javascript and then irradiated hkm with the inanity of discord chat and he's spent most of the last two years geting revenge on me
it looks like i slept through an interesting conversation
~~well if the icon comment was directed at me, thank you, if not, i am a confirmed idiot~~
oh thank you üòÉ
as i can see
so does it just respond whenever you mention it‚Äôs name?
and skarm is probably the most interesting robot i‚Äôve seen
well...see
about 8k in total
and violent
perfect.
i mean, naturally, the bot takes most of it's lines from things people say here
can i at least get my five back
he's attached to the ceiling
like
i can't believe that worked
judging by the amount of active support it has nowadays
so apparently there was a bsod during today's thrown controllers, and
one person got this right
dragonite: mom said she knew how to use dos once
wack.
sister: dos? is that punch cards?
meme
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
okay it un-failed
i think
thank you lord skamr bot
as for him actually crying during an lp, he did at one part in yakuza 0 and one part of the danganronpa 3 anime
hmm i have this paper i have to write for homework
somebody pour one out for me
is there a difference?
<:lul:528108303939665920>
very carefully
boiii
sister: "if you could be a bug, what kind of bug would you be?"
i like how quickly you had an answer to that
that's what i'd be
and it an probably survive whatever life throws at it

i'm literally the queen here

he only responds to phrases with four or more words, and there's like a ten second cooldown
interesting
when in doubt, use reverse psychology
wow rude
i‚Äôll be over in a bit
i'm gonna need a fresh pair of chopsticks cause these ones are used now
idk about ivs
true
super training gives more direct control.
yeahhhhhh id much rather shoot balloons than wait
something always has to break the chain for me before i can even get into shiny encounter territory
how is that fun exactly?
ive encountered three but two of them were hoard encounters so they dont count
sounds like a design flaw
from now on i'm calling morgana's w spooky dirt
was wondering if wolfy could be used by people who want to defeat classic captchas, so i guess that's a good thing
henlo people‚Äôs or cactuses or whatever you identify as
gay pride
all my mods are "do you hate yourself? play this!"
for the age of agression is just about done
on the day of your death we will call it a feature
on the day that npm finally breaks we'll drink and we'll sing
and when **marked as duplicate** beckons every one of us dies
but in truth it's been there all along
just sleep with the book under your pillow
absorb the words that way
i'm thinking of walking out the door and being a hermit on a mountain somewhere
good idea
i also sat around yesterday thinking of how i didn't want to do my taxes.  then i finally did them late at night and the whole day was wasted
yeah, spent on investments
she's innocent, she makes all these lovely promises, but never comes and visits.  so rude.
isn't that just paying other people to use your money and then giving you some back as thanks once they're successful?
indeed
uh oh
i don't like super hero movies
beyblade video
and.
recommended
the thing
well fuck. guess i stand corrected after all
lmao
i can blame whatever i want for my code not working
skarm that's inappropraite
don't blame me for your code not working
you shouldn't put your keyboard all the way down there because youll have to reach down for it but that's an easy fix, 9/10 overall
so how exactly did nintendo leak something from their own game again?
is that the actual script
i don‚Äôt remember the reading rainbow song
lmao
that's still like seven more people than there should be
there's like fifteen people in this computer lab and i think i'm the only one who's not like playing games or something
it's the average value of how pissed dragonite is when the pcmr people are in the computer lab
yesterday evening
this computer lab is thanos approved
finally bothered to finish
definite metaphor, good job nerd
i thought rainy is best ass
sithis does not accept such as valid payment
sorry babe, i don't make the rules, nor do i break them.
rainy i need you to take care of my bot for me
except for the wolfy bit i like that one
maybe he can redeem himself yet
cause i need to feel better about myself
i just like to see the world burn
they think they're too good for lists
im this tempted to pull up a khan academy practice quiz now because of you
squid i think it's past your bedtime
my hand is dead and my brain has short circuited
1. our damn lists
and they have a time wasted logger in ths one
though his tone towards science/math in general is like a breath of fresh air
why did nobody tell me i would've done this so much sooner
twitter just gave me an ad that said, in essence, "not smoking is gay, gay is good, don't smoke, be gay" and it's honestly an impressive level of targetted advertisement
he's pretty enthusiastic about it while a lot of other people that i see are cynical about it and see it as something to deal with
nothing wrong with that but its just, again, a breath of fresh air
me at 13: woah dragons
me at 18: woah dragons
not when yorue allergic to them
i feel betrayed ida
yet the store was normal sized
i also had a dream where i was going to the beach except i was riding down the parkway on a bicycle which also happened to be flying
oh my god
how interesting

me now: woah cats
that's a very pretty diagnostic message which i would totally remove from the channel the normal message is sent in except i think it's funny when people question it
that policy would've made freshman year move along a lot faster
not enough
not enough
i am saying i did them the coward's way
aa is life
we live in a walmart?
i used to enjoy looking around at target
our target is really nice
to make them even better theres a five guys across the parking lot from mine, so that gives me an excuse to go there too whenever we need dog food or toilet paper or bananas or whatever
smithed for the first time today!
skarm how you feeling
nice
~~who the hell tells master their last name~~
i get nervous on airplanes
e!xkcd

lucky you.
yeehaw, time for two and a half hours of suffering
when does one desire to be disturbed
welp
i have yet to be consistently active here so i may never know
one of my friends got his license when gas was like $1.80 and when it went up to $2.40ish he was like "why the hell did it get so expensive" and i was like "you haven't seen nothing yet"
i think the most expensive we‚Äôve gotten is $3.99
i wonder if i can get eyan to buy me one
e!google bicycle prices
should have done electric scooters
to be fair its not a class you try hard in anyway

the moniker rainy is not a hollow one
its becoming an undying jello that is part of a collective conscience
you'll just likely all be dead first
i mean, i have a god complex
i use the maruchan noodles but never their seasoning, i do that myself
meanwhile i‚Äôm limited to just that
the integral question

no its lesbian
if i like a guy
i‚Äôm lesbian
that's pretty gay
honestly, i don't know the acronym

oh fuck
rainy is dating sneaky?
i am?
you‚Äôre like
wait
ida's gay?
photosynthesis is hot

does that count
like the barista that asked me to dinner the other day, and i just said "i don't eat dinner"
i genuinely don't eat dinner though, so like

i'll do it tomorrow
eyan has multiple birthdays, didn't you know?
i'm gonna go buy hi m a gift, just in case

it's much safer to do it in the driveway
no i mean
but can't find it
thanks that's now burned into my rain
thank
e!pins
e!pinned
the only thing of my own that i pinned was the time i was yelling at people for being dicks to each other, all of my other bad ideas were actually master's bad ideas
it's oaky ida
sorry if i'm mistaken, but wasnt a youtube return scheduled for early april?
just wondering.
i decided to put a little more time into getting my life together but youtube is still a definite goal of mine.  i told myself april originally just to try to push myself as a motivator but i always new it was going to be later than that.
thanks skarm.
i just realized he‚Äôs still wearing the santa hat
my thought process on rebranding is, i'm older, different, and want a fresh start.  there's also no point in me returning to youtube, not enjoying myself, and then burning out in a month.
personally, i don't see a point in rebranding if you already have created a great brand.
that seems like a solid plan.
eyan i didnt know today was opposite day
cool
i prefer to go by my irl name these days.  üòõ
i love that joke, and it's relavent because y'all tend to get way ahead of yourselves
i was reminded that joke exists yesterday
and i just call him bby or dumbass
if anyone else calls him dumbass, i am allowed to kill them tho
your personal favourites as in games?
wasn't your latest review of that bingo gba game?
eyan aren't you still at work?
~~we need a new video of that bingo game~~
as do i, it's a lot easier to push a rolling stone
my name is very cryptic.
with our blood and our steel we will take back our home
down with ulfric, the killer of kings
for this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean
of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams
damn i dont understand any of these references
they‚Äôre singing a skyrim song
what did i miss?
someone politely asked eyan about youtube
i hate how the bards college questline doesn‚Äôt really add up to much
was it singing or shouting, mr. spam?
this means i am all set to be an alcoholic again
cause i can do like three shots before my taste buds say no, or i could do an infinite number of shots in cocktails
and i'm not gonna be able to cosplay lady if i am drinking sprite with... calories, eugh
o no
