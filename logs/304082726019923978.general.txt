thats where the secret money comes in
that's like the same thing right
ah, gotcha
oh look it's after one in the morning and all ive done in the last hour is google "whats the point of 4chan"
whats that the code for?
you mean like stuck in one place until knocked down?
yeah
so for some reason i decided to look through my teacher's github thing to see what he'd been working on
„ÉΩ( ÔΩ° „ÉÆÔæü)„Éé
\:thinking\:
he does that in every episode
unless she's actually a competent person
stream?
i already wave a white flag
i need a name
lesson 1
i like when ted talk(s)
<:rooisee:430400878302855177>

i do!
you just can't youtube
i don‚Äôt remember anything from calculus senior year of high school
sorry.
thank you
that took longer than it should have because photoshop was being a butt
the plot's thickness isolates
no she only has 514 points to your zero
i know
tbh mostly it's because i'm not good at vocalizing so everything sounds weird when i say it
what does it mean to not feel tired
you make a few good trades and you can probably avoid the grind
slee[
gonna need some axi's for that to work first
teacher: who knows javascript?
oh wait todays the fifth
sick
how dare they
dont think it works that way
well i wouldn't leave either way since this class is hard
i love this university now
my pre-calc-2 professor allowed us to have a 1 sided piece of paper for any formulas we could fit, and as much scratch paper as we wanted
physics is fun tho
and drago no
like 20 minutes over due
reminds me i need to do my lab manual.
so we can't definitively say it's infinite
keep learning
huh. just finished reading eldest
let me go to sleep now
and then you have logarithmic intervals as the video professes
oh okay
i'm over halfway through the day
and how strong they emphasis that course
spazzer the great
so yeah
some courses last six months
the role
got th modding yet?
i use flutter bot
thanks i needed that
i joined yesterday

oof mauling citizens is fun though.
"258 in an 8bit system"?
i can now
solve p=np
pat friend?
it can but it will revive if people are still alive
yeah no
and the newer episodes are actually more serious
and you *pay* for it to be harder
i can't watch this anymore
yee?
i used to be smart you know
sure. if youre a ceo you get millions, low taxes, and you can do whatever you want
nope
like longer vacations
yea pretty much
so more corporations get involved
you want mine?
to sleep
~~the salt lick.~~
i'm your mother, of course i'm of age
what gave it away?
help flubs
good lord
great now i have some racer's life insurance
being social is the worst
so you went into some rando's house and they told you it was pizza and you believed them without doing any prior research of your own
thats just when everything gets boring
in what context?
because quantum physics gets weirder the closer we get to -273'16
i'm hungry
yeah that many pa on individual *atoms*
assuming atoms are square which is wrong but its mostly the order anyway
i like breaking physics
gravity on neptune is only 11.15 m/ss
somewhere
everything changes mass
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  a a aaa   a a aaa          a
so its a function and not a method, got it
apple products are gross
it's a fairy explosion
you cannot pat me
dragon resists stupid
seemsgood
when moving
shoulder to shoulder generally
welcome home
and bad news
red is nicer tho tbh
its healthbar went from 100-0 as soon as the cry for help went down
also pretend to be the reverse flash if you feel like it
i should just ask if i can get all of the papers for the homework/labs/midterm/final right now and turn them all in next week, and not show up for the rest of the semester
me sleep now
1) the programmer first sketched the desired classes, before writing the code seen above.```
though it should be chill
okay who stole my bagel bites???
how are you typing then
the moon to where
there is a solution
ive been in the atlantic before and theres no sharks
imma look at my next calculus lesson
someone lost the sign
neato
5 pages long, the average lesson is about 10 pages or sometimes even crazier like 15 pages
ooooh nice
if you get understood who gives a fuck
so i guess you can throw windows out of windows if you envision the object your throwing out as a window
didnt i just put you in time-out for wasting food?
that's all im gonna say on that matter
i dont mind english
welp
i had a good response to that but i forgot it
you only blew up the food? that's unusually civilized of you
no just the comic pages
my physics teacher roasted me today
drago i‚Äôll battle you once i finish streaming ultra sun and moon
atlantic
that's fun too
volleyball
my dads place had that and it always died loudly and violently
if this was fight club
mind stone: yes
do people not do that
i wanna fight andi now
it's my home time that's poorly spent, either napping, watching youtube, or thinking to myself "i should stream stuff"
the fifteenth commandment clearly says that `thou shall not put chocolate and tomato on the same pizza`
discord stop sucking
im surprised you found a way to open a box that had no door on it
welp
and he like discover gravity
you get an essay and you get an essay and you get and essay and you-
all the while java being noun.verb().verb().etc.
i can't understand
i got all nostalgic when playing pokemon mystery dungeon when i remembered his old vids on those games. it's nice to see his community still active
but no one ever asked for my solution
look at these nerds getting sleep
she would be mistress8998
but why would you do that?
do you mean patches
thats the best name
is that a yes or a no?
a different read but a good one nonetheless
i don‚Äôt like them either
they‚Äôre more of an elementary/ middle school thing, blitz
i like this green fellow
fuck yeah
here too
does that count?
that and industrial age was end of colonial and final nail in the mideival coffin
nerds
you tell me dragonite how easy is it to eat one?
kugal why are you in an english class
and thats the start of skynet
its free
i enjoy english
go play with your cat or something
idapoo would also work but ideepoo sounds better
exponential derivatives are that easy?
i wish i could say the same
other names it goes by sometimes sound like "formal logic" if that means anything to you
that's a noni
the list just barely didnt fit on the screen, 255 is discrete math somehow and 256 is linear algebra
wait
appreciate it buddy
also good job
good
hooray for books and food
you just answered your own question
a what did a what and played what and where was i
you know i said in the literal sense
i dont want to eat a rock covered in mud
oh cool whens that coming out
whats the advantage of online classes
i know mario maker hasn‚Äôt
i gotchu squid
master dare i ask _how_ it crashes
they kinda have ongoing costs
i like that
so i have an english essay tomorrow
so you have to play twenty dollars a year to play a game. why would you do that
you dedicate one day to homework?
definitely
can you react with both to this message
he wants us to collect data together and i just wanna do it solo halp
*slaps roof of cipher* apgt dpewp trebawqq bfdoq horcwhp
*smacks cipher* this bad boy can block so many people
nice
add me if you want
estimated time to takeover: 6-10 years
thats the time that matters
he wouldnt take the thing with him
im up for grinding now btw
so much frigging effort
more like that microsoft charges $100 per year for their software
nope
me hungry
also t=+3.25 hours and still cant sleep
you're a plant?
all the other days are just night, for there is no sun
like how there‚Äôs a venom movie without spider-man
spazzer you haven't lived until you've beaten games that are older than you are
demon lord stop being old
i swear to god axi s3 only starts appearing at night
speaking of skyrim
it's from that one berenstein bears book
the sad part about me gambling is that this is actually more fun than the game itself...
which is very tiny but almost looks vaguely familiar
why is that even a question
twitter is the best social network there is, but that's like saying that
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
but i still think they need their own loveroms/emuparadise type of system instead of what they got for the nes games
if i wasn't so lazy i'd dig out the discord join/drop sound effects and then play them infinitely into my mic just to confuse you
master are you compensating for something
flubs let's be honest
its not a toggle
bye pnada
in other news dogs in cars are fun
i update it monthly

bella and aminal
last year, the most passive aggressive class(es) were geometry, earth science, algebra 2, and thats about it, they were all equally passive aggressive

darn
speaking of cacti, has that one guy said anything recently?
be nice flubs
so i have an hour before class starts so im screwing around in the computer lab trying to salvage my writing thing, and the more i read it the more i hate it
anyways brb playing aatrox
because people use the definition of stupid so loosely, getting a fact wrong makes some people go from sir isaac newton to nemrod in some people's eyes
should probably also farm derilect survival for octavia more
if you bend it far enough _everything_ can be an integral sign
because i was boosted and briefly thought guardian was aftershocik
well who knows maybe i deserve it
sure
poor you <:kappa:374346980136058893>
previews are nice sometimes

both places were good but we go to lowes more now
maybe you could try loading it into a water pistol
as a computer engineer my solution to problems is usually rebooting, blaming the programmers, or throwing more resources at it
![]==[]
he comes every two weeks
let people major how they wanna major
and drago can be a guest on the show
thankfully i only need get the intro paragraph done by the end of this week, but i'll probably try to put out an entire draft so i have a bit of a buffer.
firefox > chrome anyways
ah, gotcha
i got 1 fact wrong on my astronomy lab and that dropped the grade by 10%

my hearing is pretty bad
the people you go on discord with
also new york snow is fuckin garbage
everything

gonna try to sleep now
it‚Äôs cool that they gave a riven
like +30% strength
whats the difference between a butt ton and a normal ton
nice
its just slush
i realize drago has beaten me in every social media
or if you're behind the times, impact font.
gonna go watchwestwing();}
would corrosive font be writing with acid?
as per usual
i dont think this one has a right answer
everything's a library card if you bribe the librarian with enough
and when you die it stops being your problem
basically
that's what "formatting" means right
as you know, fred
that was master's bad idea not mine
16,318,782 as of whenever the public count was last updated

becoming school teacher is harder than it looks
im in such a good mood
my brain is 50% ponies 50% war

well that‚Äôs easy
i should probably tag him hun
you have no valid point
ok enough of being a huge nurd, time to do dog chores brb again
it‚Äôs not surprising, but official
because i do the dumb
was that because you didnt speak english or because you answered "musket" for every question

yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay hiccupping again
i thought it was unusually sane in here but i assumed that squid just left the window open again
here we see the dragonite taking a half hour to get out of bed as he continues to fiddle around with his metal spaghetti dinner from last year
it keeps fuckin changing
yeah
that...doesnt make sense
nah that sounds like work
yeah the cpp standard is like nope
the revolution was the wii's code name
all of my freinds get a week off of school this week
thats more like an arcade game than a console
nerf swords.
i wonder

you go on the google and look up snakes. they teach you codes
"here's a template lab that someone turned in in 2007, just copy and paste some words and add a table of your results and write me two sentences for why your results don't match mine and you get a 95"
my friggin college calculus course is easier than my high school honors course
the directions are equal to "ok go and do it have fun!"
also what the fuck how do teachers have enough time to grade all this stuff and still make tests and shit
my favorite part is when you catch the black hole at just the right angle and you can see an image of yourself without needing a mirror
yeah
ghosts dont scare me they make me feel safe

ive been here a while ish

sounds like a plan
okay no wonder my peanut butter is wet
i could not find a single answer

i could not agree more
coffee sucks <:kappa:374346980136058893>
im in a computer lab now and dont feel like discording on my phone

why yes i do like rigatoni thanks
thats a lady
great so header formatting doesnt work on discord i want a refund
its fuckin gross
even though i‚Äôm not bad at formal essays, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre enjoyable
then there's no way to get a refund.
so refund your nitro subscription.``` <:kappa:374346980136058893>

if you accidentally broke a table because you didn't know that would happen if you swing an axe on it, that's something you had control of

he was legendary figure supposedly living around the 6th century
what was it out of
mirage and a pyrana are broken
i found something on an old hard drive
all the while english is one of the most useless degrees that it's possible to get
it's also a few days after my finals for calc and stat
oop just got called down for dinner
its ok we still love you

i have a really bad idea hang on
blame ash
like uesp for when the power goes out

youre a robot right tyou should be good at this

just a nice, calm, uncontrolled burn
hello hello i think i‚Äôve got a migraine
not always lucky to have pdfs
okay, this is going to sound weird but hear me out.
i woke up late
is it about skyrim
so would that mean like all of his 2869 lines of spaghetti get randomly recombined with someone else's 2869 lines of spaghetti or something
though honestly, haven‚Äôt come across that problem
not yet
i have pics if you need
you need a permit until 18 or passed drived
one more hour till thanksgiving
also not putting ig first in d lul
tits
it's at least good that you're venting, though
besides, i'm not stupid, i'll be in a call with friends to watch over me.
eyan, outta curiosity, do you see a therapist?
so, to answer the question, some days it can be my entire shift, other days, not as much.  i'm "accounts payable" though so my job is pretty much just to pay bills
that‚Äôs special
learn to drive
i have a bad habit of finding an excuse to not see one
how long does that take? like, does that take your whole shift or just most of it?
so that was neat
so now i take the bus
since she knew exactly what i was going through
i know it's not the brad i know, lol
why not fly if you have to drive 7 hours?
i usually stop at a denny's in middle of nowhere wyoming
oh no eyan is dead
driving is fun for a while
and i'm sure she wouldn't mind paying interest anyways
wow, way to assume and talk about me like i'm not here
i try my best
you‚Äôre not a compl
you aren't wrong
you bastard
i‚Äôm not allowed to do anything around here
also
yeah
i demand that somebody tell me a story
i demand the story of ragnar the red stop
kinky
there once was a hero named ragnar the red
impressive
i thought at least jake would be in it
also nice unintentional double entendre
i'm a grinch, who needs santa hats
well they arent that popular and have caused a lot of problems for youtube
jake was in it; at least the last couple of episodes
she is a cat
and my body
didnt she fucking murder subaru though eyan
like i know it was a misunderstanding but she still murdered him pretty hard
i could be like the butler who always falls asleep and plays ds games on the job or something
i'll pay for all of your needed maid expenses
i can cook and clean like a goddess
and how tall is ida?  lol
beacon of feminism as i am, i've always wanted to be a maid
of course to keep it in proportion youd have to remove the forearms and the middle of the torso
so maybe rem is more apt
i like maids
just means you can attack the abdomen easier
my cousins have giants for parents so they‚Äôre all tall and it‚Äôs annoying
now we need a disappointed head butler. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
he's the butler
rainy had a soul? this is news to me
hey 9k
cats
not anymore
you ca be the daedric prince of cats
indeed
that's molag bal's domain
love made with  pizza sounds mediocre at best
that's an odd form of precipitation
i get the feeling you secretly want to actually be my maid, lol
i never said i disliked ass, just i'm more of a boobs guy, lol
just roll with it
\*and he was never heard from again\*
yo fuck thats a good point
i used to watch his stuff as well back in the day.
hay thats a plus
would i be bombarded by people‚Äôs surprise if i said i have never heard it before
how is red dead 2's music and art better than god of war's?
and proud of it
just dont watch shit you dont like, and if you do want to watch it for whatever fucking reason, dont make it our problem
i just want you all to know i went to bed at 6 so i could wake up at 1 am and play smash until work at 4:30 am
so i‚Äôm not allowed to not like something popular? don‚Äôt act like you never go through it
~~if it makes you feel better, i would probably be worse~~
it could be quite terrible so don't be too excited.  üòõ
but that's being human imo
current game plan for salvation of the project is making 3d models then getting the angle just right to have them align with an existing stock photo of a person using a product
we'll see, the theme of right now is "screw it, just do it"
it's people like you who stop by and remind me that i'm still remembered for what i accomplished so long ago
and sometimes it makes threats
i've certainly gotten salty because of popularity for things i didn't care about.  it's not really a logical train of thought though, that much i will admit.  dragonite is right, why drain energy into caring about what's popular
you got two parts in and then stopped.
emile goes on a noa rant for two minutes and fifteen seconds
ooof, drinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow.  how could i forget the golden rule
this is important
gday m8
not sure how to feel about that

that didn't work
i wish i could edit myself
no more than normal at least
for somebody to fill the void of emptiness in my life
ah, the best kind of reward
oh nice
otherwise i would have failed it miserably, lol
the college classes usually start later than my highschool semester but they also end earlier too
thats not too shabby
this stream made a bunch of people join
to me i saw 'breakfast' and it's fairly early where i am so i was like "yea makes sense" in my head lul
except for that one semesters in freshman year in highschool
i wonder what would happen if i went around introducing myself as "mr spam"
hola y'all
oh i've come to terms with this revelation a loooooooong time ago pal
it's beginning of the month so we get a lot of monthly bills around this time so i've been building up for the last few days to a day of just sitting around posting them

wow dragonite
then if your local recording doesnt have sound you can pull down the video from twitch, extract the track with just the game audio, and use that
sounds fun, but i don't think that story even has an ending
welcome to the show
i mean, i was the one who came up with the term gigglebutt, lol
but he gives out free hugs sometimes
that‚Äôs west coast
yeah, no kidding
spreadsheets actually require energy right now for me.  v_v
i actually have an irl friend now, it's kinda weird
i dunno, i'm in a weird state right now
thanks
i appreciate the company though
i could flip my loneliness to  smothered by far more attention that i could ever desire, lol
honestly, if i could have touhou powers of some sort, i probably would just be content being my own little god
imagine the chaos that perfect possession would case in the world.
i couldn't tell you a single thing about pretty much any presentation i ever watched
how dare they only charge us 6% tax
i'm also going to have learn to trust people again, lol.  i'm way too stubborn with wanting to do everything myself
very true.
no worries.
and scanned
next final after this is my calculus final
i could also easily assist in that department
got some friends that are really good at it
noice
gday mate
film was fun,
thankfully we did have to produce it. there would be no way
is it a euphemism for fart or something idk butts dont usually giggle
thankfully i stopped before i got to that level but the production of things is just overwhelming looking
crystal meth
all hail bob ross
it's true, constantly
with how the building is?
people also complained that it took too long to cover a game, which, i mean, that could be arguably a fair critism
did you know it's possible to physically move a solar system, one day the human race may say "we do it because we can" and move the sun
moving the solar system how far? it's kinda already in motion
maybe it's a sign lol
no way
guess who just got smash
the last thing is to write  my 3 minute speech about it
i should just drop bot.js in the master branch of the repository and let everyone else figure out why it's there
yeah anyway homework bye
yay thank you
that isn't illegal either
medz plus more meds sounds great
it's calculus lol
yeah but is it quick and painless or is it slowly stop being able to breathe until all my muscles stop working and i lie there immobile as my brain stops
well that is bullshit
it's just on netflix
well, glas to know the tanuki leaf is called the super leaf in ultimate
it's be beautiful
if the default healing spell costs 1 magic per second, how many points of magic do you spend after casting it continuously for 3.5 seconds
just as an fyi
nah t posing in front of a freight train
also i lowered the shanty odds
and theres gotta be a maximum age for most people right? probably before you turn 12 if i had to guess
fun story my friend almost died by booking it into a tree and breaking his nose and forehead. there was blood everywhere and that is when i discovered that death is a thing
also here's a memefrom 2011
what about like your spine or something
what the crap cats
only dumb dogs
good job
oh you meant like...ohh
oi, try singing on those choir stands for 20 to 30 minutes with no lumbar support
attempt mage
the programming community should band together to destroy the evil
forknife has some problems but its the best one out there
thanks buddy
ive seen it. its pretty good
theres a non purpose?
how many hours do you think i have on ultimate <:gwsetmyxpeepoevil:405337570952740864>
if youre not playing it now the answer is "not enough"
i got a 128 gb sd card for this game
i would have like that
calculated that back in june
and with the let‚Äôs go games selling 3 million copies fast, i think it‚Äôs safe to say we will be seeing more let‚Äôs go games
that it is
you‚Äôd still get the best thing and use those buttons for others anyway
wait crap when did it become 11 pm
how many
the rewind has over 9.9 million dislikes
help
whatever happens happens i guess lol
every day is christmas
you should totally talk to us
it's funny because he's pink nu
one of my friends is like barely hanging onto straight a's
he'll be fine then.  meanwhile, i'm sitting here thinking that i didn't have a job until 23 if you don't count youtube
my appetite has hit the gutter though.  i've lost 5 pounds in the past week and a half.  i'm okay with that though, i was slowly adding weight over the past year and i'm happy to shed some of it off.
thats an interesting way to look at it, i havent thought of that
and also because i don't even know what kind of person i like
morning? my day is mostly done
and i don't want to be foolish and jump into something that's doomed to fail just because i feel lonely.
because i still feel like i acted wrongly, even if i just didn't have the right information to act
i value other perspectives.
i also know what i like
as long as i like them for them im happy
yea i've always been in the mindset of it's better to wait, any attempt to wait to become older to fully commit in a relationship take that opportunity
im gonna brb, i should get ready to leave here for the bloody final
ah yes, that's kinda important
or just is too screwy for my tastes.
nah, i really am just looking to talk to people
i don't have it down to a science, but as the years pass, i get better and better at knowing myself
woah that's an essay to catch up on
honestly wouldn‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs highly dependent on the person
which brings me back to, where's my damn life cheat codes at
except the dragonborn is life and you're alduin
she's definitely too good for me and she knows it
i mean, i'm honestly not opposed to mixing things up
if you don't start i'm gonna scan out every page of the drivers ed book i have somewhere and randomly send you pages
may have to
im back
10k subs?
that would burn through healthy mental states like a forest fire through california
i can't have too much summer and spring though, allergies are just too rough on me.  fall and winter offer me that reprieve
not the most appropriate timing there
or something like that
i prefer to look out upon the world and see death and desolation
and i'd say i'm not exactly a road rager, but bad driving is probably my biggest pet peeve
and probably die
there is dragons, just, imaginary, lol
eyan, i‚Äôm sure you have a better chance than me in my area üòõ
there‚Äôs always full streets of parked cars here
its ok dragonite
and then i will get one
on the topic of warm temperatures
147 is borderline death are you mad
ew...
i don't know you well bella, but you seem like a good person.  i don't think the arrogance that rainy is displaying is appropriate, but i think you can feel good about yourself
well, you are his creator
ida your country is already skyrim
sadly, i always have a nagging feeling to be productive so it feels like a waste of time
is there a good mod that lets you be a bard?
any female* single
i never used one but i know there was one bard mod that was pretty popular
and usually anything that popular was at least good if it was what you were looking for
huh, darn i would've been good for music lol
exactly
i'll have you know
that it is, thanks flubs
welcome!
worst bot 0/10
what master said
either way pings will fly when it starts
wow how specific
no reverse cards not uno cards
hey i have a life
why you cant go to college and also be successful? i mean you can but i dont see why youd put yourself at a four year, hundred thousand dollar disadvantage
yea..
i actually can't wait for the return.
but also, same. sadly
~~who?~~
i'm michael stevens
between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes
dont it though i mean if you got money you can get one of those cool hand freezing anti-death machines
maybe i removed it when i fixed the thing with the censor list not working
you get that a, wouldn't want anyone getting d around here
screw you
yeah the censor list doesnt work
<:gwqlabsthonkery:398950779769061376>
and ive heard good things about those pocket monster games
i feel like you do
flubs you're a wonderful person who's going to live a long and happy life
text or call your grandma
huh.
oh, who am i kidding, of course you don‚Äôt
now the only thing i send outbound email for is calling my sister dumb names
to obad im already 2200 messages behind for that
how were you not already using gmail
you too huh?  üòõ
cows are food
afterward it goes back to normal style
cows that exercise taste better btw
mcdonalds doesnt really care if their meat tastes a little worse
or at least doesnt have the time for it
what'd i miss
who decides that's a good idea though sharing blood is the source of like half the non-malaria diseases in the history of forever
but probably no because theres no way this is gonna become a problem in my lifetime
do i want to go in for my last final or just sleep
brad is this what you do for fun
actually it doesnt but thats still an awful lot
also surprisingly doing ok despite getting up before 4:30 today
well i know that 8.2/40 is around 20% prolly closer to 21% so you couldntve done 5 times better but definitely did more than 4.75
mood.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
thank you
want the audiobook?
i think my transcripts get updated tomorrow
0.0 stephen is doing a weird thing with the ending song atm on stream
you‚Äôre definitely thinking about it a lot then
my final english grade is 98.2% lol
i cant engrish despite passing engrish final
the midterm was like 90% multiple choice with just one short response  it should have been graded by the computer
thanks <:pogchamp:305560024443518986>
same honestly
quesadilla burgers are great
it turned a samsung galaxy into a grenade.
and whatever other fucking shit that counts as a character
skarm is god
i feel a growing sense of dread
my weapon is bad memes
i think theres one in the house in solitude that starts the whole thing
those books have an interesting property to them in regards to damned souls, bella
tmw your robot has friends and you don't
brb gonna go talk to her
why madagascar?
oh right
that's ok
hmm it's 10:30 and ive gotten nothing done i brb
lol if you want to
just turn it into a snowflake with editing magic
i wasnt on the ssformus
master these are your people or something
oooooooo
dragonite42 :::)))))
doubt anyone remembers blackrayquaza except the few that knew
no matter how well i do on the final in one of my classes my grade will go down
just gotta use a bit of algebra slight of hand and u substitution and bam its super doable
it's a little rough but it's not like i'm doing anything else with my pitiful existence so may as well.
at my school it was a 65 or below was failing and you only could go on to the next class in a series if you got at least a 73
it would seem that way
this is a problem
i'm down to my last brain, if that one explodes then, well i'm shutting down until my next brain get's fixed
lots of new people
but mr stabby is a snowman
hey, i can only afford 7 brains alright
then i'll throw a triangle
you said yeah first which makes the no invalid
kinda lame, i wanted the car alarm to go off
both
i wouldn't be angry obviously, just don't care
dovahkiin, doomguy (just for the music), crono (watched eyan lp his game so many times), crash (i played 1 game being nitro kart), 8th gen pokemon
and it was
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
everyone else that has a chance is just i don't care really
watch as the dlc pack for crono only has 1 song in it if he's a character lol
i'm more inclined to play ff6 than 7
yeah and still only 2 songs
also i think geno might be dead now
and universal is owned by comcast iirc which is a competitor to disney
i'd love to see banjo in the game, but i'm not holding hope for it even with microsoft being all for the idea
and well
i really don't know who else they could choose
i'd say it was that he was announced as the first dlc of the fighter packs, even at such a big event no less
exactly, what i said
for some reason, the 21st always had weird sentimental value to me for absolutely no real reason but i forgot about it this year
it makes sense actually. i think i‚Äôm the same way, but i had an earlier birthday than i was supposed to but i don‚Äôt know the date of that
you can catapult yourself ahead a lot faster if you get a good one
*plays the ‚Äúi hate people‚Äù song from spongebob* this should be my theme song
as it turns out, i'm going to be spending most of today applying for my first ever job.
paving your own path is the dream
everyone did
or at least well enough to enjoy venting his frustrations on fictional characters by brutally murdering them?
you tell me, you're the one who answered the question
either way, they need to work as well to get their pay
an ethically questionable career
it honestly annoys me even as someone who has never played their games
nice ^w^
but still, i just didnt get any joy from it.
i think it's supposed to be a glass of water per drink
most people forgot about the meteos situation within two weeks, so it kinda is
they'll get over it
i frequently forget rall exists
k pop.
ohh....
i dont understand, why are there people that find underage anime girls attractive?
do you exercise regularly?
cuz even small things like going for a run can help combat feeling depressed and down,
neither am i
close enough
and i have a soda machine in our lunch room but i've been cutting back
i also forgot where my box was so i lost my debit card as well
anyways food is here peace
what is wrong with me
i don't even know what that is so i'm good
it's an internship position.
actually, good
today's was about cats
it's a floating island how hard can it me
nice
the angles of it make it tough
that would be somethin' else
live a little
greetings, animal\_man\_.
thank you for listening to my speech
yeeeaaaaaahhhhhhh
switch things up
then it'd kill me though
i mean youd assume as much
honestly yeah
oh that
you got that pretty spot on
also, yeah kugal, i guess it was technically a job, in fact a damn good one, but i feel like it did nothing for me in terms of developing skills i need for the normal workforce so now i'm playing catchup
what are the main memes of 2018
i'm just depression drinking to ignore the fact i'm spending christmas entirely alone
i'm not eating there
those bastards
magus9000 fainted!
i've never been so complimented and intrigued at once
cool
i don't have time i just make it by putting off things that are actually important
but cool
get fallout 4
based on the context, you
what are we fucking?
magfest is a 3.5 day event so on any given day there's a 1% chance that i'll be at magfest
kings orders
merry christmas eve, ya nerds
music and gaming festival
of course you did
have fun, don't break anything
oh i have some time rn, time to scan out the driving rules book and start bothering bella with that
*me starts harmonizing* who lives who dies who tells your story
i like how the modern internet just lets you google strings of six words and instantly find out who said them
ironically missed the ping because i was playing sims 3
yummy
nice
its the one people want the most of
that is, if you play the drums
well you can be alive on the outside and dead on the inside
like one day the charger port just decided to lose any and all grip
the clone wars
point b
present spoiler
something something westbound train 70 mph something something eastbound 10 mph faster something something when will they meet
i can't talk
that
no the answer is boston because one train breaks down
i'm on data
mine may have a second one, but with the only angle i'm viewing it from, it'd be impossible to see
it's always an experience
merry christmas, nerds.
at least send him to the right channel
i thought mine was missing a few vowels
the twelve days of christmas?
he‚Äôs a baby so most of them are blurry as heck
nice
im ok
i could say whats on my mind right now, but i'll save it for when he's sober <:lul:305559915714576385>
is it on sale?
happy crimas friend
she is
i am a goddess
hey eyan are you streaming tomorrow
ok nice
they have coffee. i am sleepy. it‚Äôs also almost eleven. it‚Äôs probably not worth
other than that one time
why does mute not fucking work on the bot
shes into kinky shit
<:gwnonexmaikasmug:402867199825674251>
it‚Äôs still only christmas #1 tho
so my average day for the past year consists of 7:51 of sleep, 3:20 warframe, 2:39 school, 1:40 with eyan, 1:36 with family, 0:57 on homework, 0:37 in the car, 0:36 on reddit, and everything else is bellow half an hour so its inaccurate
merry christmas
happy christmas exclusively to those who dont celebrate
christmas merry
hmmm sleep what a good idea
theres a second one?
id join and sing but my throat is missing
how loosely?
i might pop into the stream later when my family is not here and i actually have peace and quiet
i‚Äôm a baconator
cakeonator
underwhelmed
ator*
i'm just gonna stay in call while playing ffxiv
huh. actually gotta go, hopefully stream'll still be up when im back
good lord you people are still in voice?
well then the little things should make you not miserable
santa's stand is jesus?
okay, ,christmas party in vc.
so you got 3.4 years
thank god
my shit is beokken
i asked for a new phone for christmas. hopefully, i get it tomorrow
i drank soda does that count for something <:kappa:374346980136058893> lol
this is the most i've drank in
oh fuck
lmao thanks i think
guys
nope
nani
hey guys remember christmas from chrono trigger?
you get in for comedy
that test would have me fail hilariously
yeah but not for you
panic mode activate
ruined the grading curve
i mean
i win???
deja vu
look
they don‚Äôt reach a peace, that‚Äôs alright
time to get some pistols and a doctor on site
you got this
you have him turn around so he can have deniability
honestly, i'm stupid proud of that timing
oh god
that's me falling out of my chair
how can men be so fucking dense
like what the fuck
are you calling eyan stupid
it's a mess
mucho mejor
depends on starting location and end destination
yes danit
oh my
fuck you
i'm in school, so that's where it's spent
not rn
so like
panda can‚Äôt math
i‚Äôll try to. i haven‚Äôt played in a while
tsa broke a $400 prop
eyan
we can‚Äôt hear you. at least i can‚Äôt
hear who
ehhh
all of my attraction
go to hell, robot
it's one of those big neckhole ones
wait get one for me while you're at it
i paid and played
you're just noticing?
eyan
no thanks lol
you know you love it, babe
no clue how it works tho so rip lol
wow, eyan just called me cute
me and my sister were playing smash this morning, on the gamer stage
i wasn't here when that happened
holy fuck
you always do, babe
awww
dumb
you like drunk me?
heed
nighty
and also to god
night guys ^w^
did you see that density chart
i probably will soon enjoy, i fucking love hiking
oh everyone's gone
haven't gone on any this month, probably a good idea to go burn off the like 4000 calories of booze anythe 300 calories of christmas dinner
i got an electric blanket for christmas and it has helped wonderfully to alleviate cold
7% but i'll ignore it on rainy's behalf
you seemed to be quite interested at one point in time
lol, i know i'm weird
also eww
i mean, you could be like rainy, she's interesting, but it cost her her soul
it's okay, i am too
i mean, people in general arent very interesting. they dont have character arcs to follow and no cool powers. they just complain and use resources until they roll over and die
i mean
being that awesome doesn't come free
oh, so we're role playing now
it's such a bother to have to keep turning all caps on and off
enlighten me, why?
rainy said this [2:01 pm] thy queen, zealots: you can just yelll at me, i'm into it
because you are innocent
fair enough
r/askreddit i assume?
same, they feel like a waste of time
there was some story on reddit about things people accidentally said during sex and that story blew up and went full scale meme
i don't call him that, master is a... reserved term for me
don't worry, i can definitely get more mad
thank you my queen
so just as a warning, dont get mad if it is very stupid
you'd have to be some eyan levels of dense
are eyan and rainy dating?
no, please do
all of em
she just likes fucking with me
go to hell robot
that's not how being dense works
this day is draggin
also you only got what, 2 hours left
normally it's like 40-50 minutes depending on how fucked i get, but it should be 30 tops today
look
i blame rainy
that's how i felt yesterday, but i think that's just called  a hangover
i'm capable of trying
just gotta gimme the word to release it
new year's isn't until next week
materials for everything else: <$80
obviously
so do i, i built a youtube channel off of it
rainy only shared one of the two cat pics
yeah that sounds about right
what's the least ajit part of florida?
don't ruin my fantasy eyan
wait
should we document dragonite as an scp
i'm gay now
if you must specify a playable race, probably balgruuf the greater
who is the hottest male character in skyrim?
too much stress
i can make any cosplay for any body, given enough... experience with said body
you won't stop me from handling you sexually? wow, truly a scholar and gentleman
why would i not be?
people like complaining more than money duh
nice
hmmm
technically i'm referring to my ap system, not windows
i didn't even know we were dating let alone that far into things
i get the pc
"rainy - guru & queen of ass"  something like that?
a-sofs
i get his cat
i ain't eyan's s tuff
but i dont know if i could handle that responsibility
highly effective
me right now
well, it's up to her, lol
you're good at drawing a bunch of scribbles and pretending they're instructions
are you?
what were your expectations?
i wanted to go to prom, but
alcohol?
but i wanna dance
black 2 and white 2 came out
eyan you just need to learn how to optimize your talents, is all
i didn't choose anything last night
plot twist, i was gay all along
btw, 9k, set our permissions for the voice channels to include anything prehistoric frog and above
thank you for that
fuck all that
no idea what you're talking about but okay
imagine being assassinated by someone who uses a knife and fork for their pizza
i never would have guessed from the name
so it was _you_ who sent me the free trial of playboy magazine?
it recommended a game called boobs saga
what's with you and baconators?
steam apparently understands me
you'll notice i said "mostly"
probably
it's not your fault
huh, maybe i don't have you beat then, technically i only have 3 but i had a fourth that was close
all driving speeds will be in m/s
i doubt she remembers half the names
you dont have to give us an exact number, just the data type that would be required to store them
yeah but with even more ways to start an explosion
like all over the damn place
i sort of always imagined rainy is the personification of a nuclear bomb
i'm sorry
zero
he's dumb
i'd say she needs to aim
the deepest emotional connection i've had heretofore...
how depressing do i wanna get with this?
probably wise
backup brains, i burned through 3 of them in my theory final yesterday
no swearing.
well i'm not
oh yes
everything
the heart wants to beat
my two year+s with men permanently scarred me (one literally) and my year+ with a girl is still my friend
the heart wants a beating
but on the other hand the brain gave us video games
yeah but brains also invented the lobotomy
that sounds like a problem that can be taken care of at a later point in time
stop
i mean
i type, send, and than ignore
you should send them to random foreign emails
play smash bros.
cause in it's time, it was fucking stupid
same honestly
unless it's to x person/people who shan't be named
not brilliant
you were
driving trip continues, i'll be there at like 1
you're welcome
bring me some takis to apologize
<:roodab:509458870700212235>
i ain't picky
lets get it
so it doesnt really matter
shall i spam it
hmm, i'll move to st catharines, seems like my kind of city
but alas
no promises
what kinda breakfast do you prefer?
but eyan
alright, fine, i'll take the pic after i make you breakfast, if you're clothes aren't on by then you're a lazy fuck
probably not
can i come in the middle of it than?
i dunno, next summer
you will not escape coffee
fair
we have acquired the vip, back in another 50
that it is
hear me out
tim horton's is üëå
i'll be long gone
nice
unless it was just a jebait
yo right
none of them are talos
actually isaac brock
empire loves lists
move everything else down a step
the christians are so boring with one jackass
no offense to any christians in here but your religion robbed me of the first 16 years of my life
even thought mike is still alive
making a molotov without vodka is heresy
and jack daniels
wait you mean it's possible?
i'll let you know later
doesnt sound like anything new
whos the manager?
rainy have you tried a preschool that doesn't have catholic influence?
yeah it is better the vip is roasting dad's bad management
the anti-virgin
he wants anything
if you make that graph
i will add on another dirnk to what i owe you
flubs
such a sucker for food?
megumin, put her close to but below me
anywhere
hiya will
that scale tho lol
i am aroused
thanks deci and panda for setting the curve
i'm just going through discord look for things i called god at any point
ok rain
can you fill this out
and the 100%+ percent come from things outside of the game universe
this is fidget, she killed god
that's the only material i know on top of my head cause it sounds like weed
rude
thats less than not productive
skyrim?
hell yeah
it's the goddamned skyrim engine
i'm into it
time off means memory decay
it has a purpose
integral of y dx
not much, you?
and i can‚Äôt fall back asleep because i‚Äôm hungry
but you won't go the fuck to sleep
i'm much more at home in inkscape than gimp, but i'm learning, i think.
and i told you to go the fuck to sleep
oh, so we want to debate semantics of what is possible vs what is justified?
oops all caps
i wish it was time for lunch
i love the genre though so i'll never not like metroidvania
that's deep
the number one reason i want smash is because smash
when that shit comes around i'll have to settle for not actual nerds cause all the actual nerds will be fucking their computers
he'd be way too op
yeah, and?
i'm just depressed
wow 9k, i've never seen someone on here have such a correct opionion
dark chocolate is where it's at
dark chocolate reflects the bitter, stygian nature of my soul. i have a connection to it that spans the eons
you're wrong on the grounds that you annoy me
he's just dumb, he doesn't know what he's saying
we shall rest when we are dead
this kingdom doesn't actually have rules against any type of death
you see the trick is to do that before you leave the shower
try harder
this is too lewd
pardon me, i am as dense as the entire universe packed into a tiny spec of spacetime right before the big bang
you want her to give you a not dumb reason?
real life is dragging me out of my coffin
imma take an aside to say i have a great butt.
that's cause you're stupid
sounds like it‚Äôs doable at least
i mean, i got a b
mmmmm
eyan what's the integral of 3dx
but in high school, that was failing for me
high school was hell for me
listen here you little shit
so applying for schools is fun
oof no reminders about gpa
took one, did fuckall on the english and essay portions, somehow got 1440
my condolences rc
not really, i didn't try that hard, lol
hope so
mmk, that's acceptable
yeah, dia
kinky
i have no siblings, but i look forward to fucking with my cousins in the same way
that should answer all questions
oh yeah that works
but the pixel count
it's in the show
the blonde's outfit on my desktop is one of the cosplays i have now
that one?
they have icons
for like, everyone
even the bot hates me
if the rapture happened would it resemble the snap?
curiosity expands the known data set to expand a search for potential patterns which can in the long term simplify the work necessary to get a desired answer
i expect nothing less
how many people sailed out into the unknown and were never heard from again before one managed to find a new land?
he does proc the censor on edits thought
neither does living another 10 years
sure having them around is great for then and there but that impact is limited. if that group does manage to find somethi- this is the part where i realize i have no idea where i'm going with this
sure it does
are we planning on re-implementing the naughty words censor or something
that's a topic for down the road
something about elon musk wanting to have other companies put him out of business
also master im disappointed you did not save fus go fuck yourself
fair enough
in a good way or a bad way
what is a man
hmmm
eyan isnt it past your bedtime
that's what curiosity gets you
doesnt automatically invalidate them all
actually it doesnt
and are they still alive
do you have any data on how often questions in this server actually end with question marks
you mean tomato juice right
some people are into that
what is a man
jesus is into drinking blood
so one to one reply to valid conditions should be fine
it's symbolic ya ninny
nice
ok so yesterday you defined who was in the pantheon
>for 10 million, i think my wife would be there cheering me on.
well i'm out until later, so it'll have to wait
by the 8
ask about the most obscure thing possible
i have stuff to do for the next hour or so
also fuck the thalmor too
eyan it's just an array chill
mages can cast beneficial spells on others, does that make them gods?

hmm it magically came back
this is a good one to start with

yeah just mix booze with snowberries, moon sugar, and frost salts
spiced brandy
go for it
the precision of this spreadsheet is an art
just reeeee
we're playing for second place
eyan you're ok with boring
i mean, you're invited if you want ida
guys go to sleep
i can't wait to go crash at eyan's hotel whenever he's working night audit
too tired?
haven't we all?
cause you said $25 a month
if someone gets hurt, that's an assault charge
oh i can assure you
but eyan
i could just what?
do you though?
am i not worth the effort?
i look gay in glasses
does he go on the pantheon?
he portrayed an emotionally confused late teen rather amazingly
i like my girls with short hair
sipho dias is the real mvp

"are you having a fucking chuckle" -rainy rn
depends on the day
out of what set?
a perfect culmination
a solid one
alright glhf
i kinda wish i was at work right now, so much regret will be had tonight
around here at least
that was a very fitting response actually
so, never?
proud of you
think of all the pretty things you can buy me
i'm never bored, just attention starved
i'm never bored
e!bot
my next one is *probably* gonna be a treehouse
4tn1te
it also may have been spillover from dc
which happened to permeate like 1.5 states
she was giving pieces of information and i wanted to have it all mapped out nicely
you call that nicely
my critics are... usually shortlived
i was distracted scp readings
i call that a clusterfuck
better.
just saw coffee
yeah thats right skarm
i've still got 4 hours and 35 minutes
is it better than regular coffee?
what will cup of java give you
stream nerds

uwu
<:ceselaayaya:506890802707038209>
üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ
and then theres the last year memes that theybforgetbto remove from the production build
probably not
the turnpike has opened up to three lanes though so theres probably less than 70 miles left
good job
same thing
hungover stream
wouldnt the light from the screen hurt his eyea
there are a bunch of people who tell me it's good, should i submit to defeat and join them?

hmm should i join stream or get things done for the first time since forever
lmao he started singing in another server so it continues here
i'm gonna buy a suite so that i can cook shit... though i don't think gaylord suites have ovens... hmmmmm
what do you even do at conventions
good job unicode (‡πë‚Ä¢Õà·¥ó‚Ä¢Õà)b
have you ever eaten at the sports bar thing inside the gaylord? every time i dropped by the wait time was like an hour long
d&d is probably something i'd love, yet have never touched
also ida, oh honey
i will host d&d&d in my room at mag
that's next year
nice
oh wait wrong thing
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

eyan

it was fun seeing him
i'm so sad i missed out on the peak of vr chat
havent seen him in a year or so
oh wait i know why
pi vpn
i dunno, however much force it takes to stop ~50kgm/s of momentum
scanning is easy when youre able to stand
just like me
yo that name is cursed
then that depends on how long it took
feel better kugal
nerd
don't you do it
well welcome back, bac. we missed you.
i agree
like i dont get whats up with that
i find that actually to be wrong
not as rarted

that is a pretty awesome avatar, lol
but like minus 500 hours
to quote eyan from earlier today, " you're not my mother"
ok skarm take a few steps back
and looking for somebody to love
yeah if we act normal in the beginning its just gonna make the truth even more horrible
oh my
midnight, so basically, pretty early

it's the law
you cannot say those things
it's okay i ask myself that question every once in a while
rainy this is the real tmabird who made everybody's circulation btw

bailee b snyder
oh wait

a fucking loser
i hate guys like that
i just wanted to see how far i could stretch
double win
i could make such a depressing joke that it would definitely ruin my night
oh hey, i opened that
yeah, ffxv, main four characters genderbent
i dunno which one do you think i should do :o
i am mostly done with my cosplay for the leftmost gal
i just need to get the abs
i am a man i think
i'm surprised there's no "#selfies" channel in this discord
chubby is fine
well
night bella <:roohi:510305569475657740>
i mean
nice to meet you, see you later
better
we were talking about depressing stuff
and insecurites
i can play the piano way better
<:gwgoashuu:405753103326117888>
yeah lol
~~6 exeggcute or 1 exeggcute?~~
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
one, i have curly fucking hair
that sort of thing goes in <#311402910820859914>, arkada.
that's 30 minutes on it's own
can i just say
when eyan said a few
all of them
do you need a hint, darling?
and since it's a weekend i do my once a week skincare routines, like 15 minutes
<:kappapride:379352530863521792>
but the only attention you give me is the rude kind, lol
i know i am
it doesn't mean you're not cute tho
no no
speak for yourself
victorian
is that a thing now
it's the uv radiation of the sun that's the issue
oh ok
can i just live inside of an x-ray machine
according to the song
i love d&d i just wish i had more spare time to play
ive just never found the right people to play with. theyre all fun and nice, they just dont keep consistent enough schedules to play ever
honestly, i just don't have time and other people for tabletop gaming nowadays. aside from the rare instance that i do.
by putting down the things he doesn't like
but the usually coincide
hello gambit but with boobs
i ruin everything :)
with discord and roll20, for example
according to this book, eyan is too much of a coward for us to date
god i hate children
what else does it say
stream.
you mean almost by "all 3 were nearly killed" or "the number of children i have killed is approaching 3"?
half the time that's when i end up going to sleep
help
i can
i still think <:kappa:374346980136058893> looks similar to emile
i'm assuming that's there as a joke, considering candyman is the only with it.
just now?
also wait
at the very least, i hope we get a mini direct like last january
so all of us are free to abuse your bot then, since he did it to us first
also am i the only one who finds it weird how someone would want to avoid knowing about dlc content
just a thought
other way around here, sleepy but not tired
so go ahead
hmmmm
i am lonely, i am gay, i have depression
but sleep is still a solution to exhaustion
and i know that difference better than most
you're not wrong
i am very opposed to doing something
the only reason i'm here is because eyan is
its for your own good
as most things are in my life
eyan leave
what am i saying
he just admitted it more or less, lol
yes you are
hey look on the bright side though
is that am or pm
its just a matter of doing it
uh....retail :)
do you work in the loading bay
this has probably been posted here before but i can‚Äôt be bothered to look through the few months of stuff i‚Äôve missed so here
i did that for a few days and basically ceased existing
didn‚Äôt feel like it at all
oh yeah thats me
i ws going to make a joke but i decided against it
im not a fan of onions
im bad at type
i am mostly just fond of them on burgers
pretty much try every food at least thrice
i think a game crashing on a loading screen is better than it just loading forever
in the show
the first pokemon ash is shown to have is a voltorb
just name daniel robert gheesling, maybe include a home address or something
i didn't ask about taste lol
woke up to see star wars on. nice
<:king:356095432495202315>
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
when we start doing annual zeal meetups we can play for a few hours each time
genius
i'd have to go with switch
this is quite the predicament
that‚Äôs fair.
oh yeah that one too
oh damn
you guys wanna waste more time with league?
currently not home, so i would join later
nice
thats why im waiting for the netflix version of the cw shows
20 is not bad.
that‚Äôs the point, i like seeing people‚Äôs reaction when it‚Äôs going on
because the earlier ones could also play ps2 games
~just rewatch the crossover all summer~
but then you watch everything super late.
i‚Äôve only seen it a couple times... its not even about the game.
i get to into movies
i mean, we spend time more on games yknow?
as a mets fan i lead a life of annual disappointment
i doubt thats legal
goodmorningall
not gonna lie the only game i want on swich is smash
so far the games i‚Äôve played on pc don‚Äôt do as much for me as console games have
look at his sub animation
did somebody say miku?
oh my god
can i share them in this chat?
i have
except for 2015
never thought of it
i have a miku print somewhere but all my past con stuff is kind of just shoved away waiting to actually be displayed one day
that way you have an idea when you are financially ready but cpu and motherboards change so quickly youd have to make some changes when you are ready
also i have acquired pizza
i mean
i can get him to stop if you want
driving is my sanctuary when i am a sad boye
all the important places are nearby
one day
"empty" streets are nice
we have to drive 25-30 minutes to do anything
steal the silverware for yourself, then
i take it that the midwest is no longer high noon land
not that i need
however
yeah, northeast is good for dodging natural disasters, the worst ya get is snow
yeah but new orleans isnt even that big
bloons
ooos it‚Äôs one
disaster
still big enough to do a lot of damage
wacky? really?
also we're pretty good at moving a lot of people around quickly
true, there aren't just roads in new york. there's also the subway system
the residents are cannon fodder no matter what city they're in when a storm goes for the particular city they're living in.
well that's not really anything new for hurricanes in general
ah, return of the jedi, what a classic
i dont know what youre talking about
the more south they are, the worse they are.
lol rip
yeah
also birds arent real and the moon is a myth
satorl marsh is probably the butt tbh
i'm never too drunk for investment banking
im like part of tornado alley tho
eyan, my honour has been bismirched, defend me
okay, now they have the right to die
well that is just rude
oh they're long gone.
why do people ever feel like that?
rainy have you ever piloted an automobile
same as g
though with working at a hotel, i feel eyan has more available
understandable
cant you just get more out of candyman?
i certainly pay dividends though.
you make a compelling argument
eyan knows a good relationship will be an expensive one regardless
i usually prefer thinner and crispier, mushy fries make me sick
eww fries
ever had a gretan, arakda?
ughhhhh
i have so much tired
yeah, economy, sorry
so i'm at less than 15 in the past 72, why god. why?
to be fair, i wouldn't want to watch last jedi again anyways, lol
i'm never bored
i'm just glad that j.j. abrams is directing episode ix
i do it for rey
the fuel is what matters
cutting out the parts with finn probably would‚Äôve helped
if i recall correctly rainy paid $10 for that
that it is
same
i just wish i had more outlet's. since my pc/internet has been a bust for months all i have is my laptop. so i'm very limited on what i can do. im tired of watching movies, anime, youtibe videos. i'm bored and sad. not a good combo tbh
you want to get more out of what little free time you have?
oh it is, i've enjoyed playing through the world of light
story of my life lol
that's a good way to just delete free time
they should have ryan reynolds cameo in dc and starwars movies
ooh congrats
i didn‚Äôt read it tho
jeez 9k, it's like you aren't even mlg lvl 30 in btd5 *or* btd6
not even on pc yet
<:gwoiczenthink:390299938250293250>
a manakete would be sick as hell, but it won't happen
go outside or something <:kappa:374346980136058893>
nobody would expect that now
my dumbass just hit the power button by accident
welcome
i didn't know when my last save was, but it was only ~15 minutes
we can make a night of it
he is competitively ciable
rainy i gotta warn you
yes he does
he's b tier
but one you play him
xenoblade chronicles' composer did a remix of gangplank galleon and it's nnnnnnnnnnffff
of who the third character might be
piranha plant, joker, and -redacted-
i think it'll be a final fantasy rep
yeah
i know i am but what are you, eyan
wow did they even try
for that 3rd character?
dark pit is s tier
excuse me for my french but
you'll be extra down
i played a fair amount of link too
my queue is bugged
that was my 616th
neet
iowa is in central
that was a fantastic last game
also
anytime you want
oh goody
if i knew why i was sad
i have terrible taste in men apparently
you have some low spec games to play?
what's up lol ^w^
plus i enjoy typing
bella i thought you were like, 18 lol
ooooh they have the watchmen movie on netflix. i havent seen it and wish i realized that three hours ago
which co-worker?
nope
yeah but it explains boobs
ha, it's not even 1 here
just a hunch
no the suit is what makes them look pretty
that sleep schedule tho o.o
don‚Äôt call me dan, dan
you are saying
i've killed people for less
did you just call me candy dan
hey, kamui uses a chainsaw
candyman kill me
he's definitely the last metroid character that i think can be reasonably added to the lineup
really, not many classic metroid characters are characters i think they can reasonably add to smash
kraid is a part of one of the brinstars
here's hoping no executive meddling happens. it looks like samus will make a full recovery from being on hiatus.
i now see why it is rated t
i just think it's an out there choice that makes sense
since hunters took place between prime 1 and 2
night bella ^w^
that second part was uncalled for
wait all the hunters are alive
some would say lord retard
the oversear
~~she probably bribed eyan~~
id let a stranger fuck me for 10m
nay.. like a horse?
skarm is retarded
paid for a house with sex
it's lovely dear
hmmmm
and if i could get my partner involved in it, it's like a win-win-win-win
just be single forever like me
just answer once for yes, once for no
glad we cleared that up
did not mean to dc lol xd
there's a bunch of outfits that make the characters in their underwear and nothing else
i said everyone, not everything
alright
that speech class is as hectic as i expected
thanks
i'm reading an article about rockstar games and it casually mentioned that `this comes after the news last week that the xbox scarlett and ps5 next-gen consoles are expected to be announced in 2019`
eyan dont say the f word
something something work suck
fucking weebs
it was on sale
why did nobody tell me about this
boots
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
boots
i'm pretty sure the official nintendo account hasn't tweeted anything yet
isnt there always a big january blowout though
what will we do with a drunken sailor
that's cool
yeah at some point i think i didnt really care
but yeah gordon ramsay would be cool
but there's better air flow
id assume the friction of moving makes that far more likely
oh man they actually still post a small number of videos every few years
just like that
i mean if you just walk through sand like that you probably had it coming
i steal things and ruin lives, not use magic to fix stuff
agh my calc ii prof hasnt gotten back to me so now im slightly terrified he wont before the class begins lmao
ok then
hmm you might not object to that
is this like lwiay but for papa ryan?
wake up you hoe
easy top 3
cynthia would like a word with you
i like how im already done with work for today
for the record it's "tertiary"
i haven't gotten anything really bad since about 2010 either. somehow around then i got an infection that caused my computer's printer spooler to stop working. that was fun. and a pain in the neck because in 2010 i had to actually print out stuff.
i just started
maybe i should enter it into a virtual machine or something and find out
python
don't worry rainy, i still like you
as much as i want to give you attention rainy, it's my lunch break
never claimed to not be normal
it just sounds like a gutteral hissing
weirdo
probably something with sheep
i literally just play to get diamond than quit
wait a minute
caged
finger had a minor stroke
haven't played since like a year ago
good thing i'm always tired
but i'm never tired enough
well that and i somehow overlooked the fact that he said we should do this again sometime <:rooderp:531156967943569410>
yes you do
oh wait, i might actually have a reason to be sad
you left it up to me and what i decided wasn't good enough
wow, not giving attention to me, so rude
we should abolish snow
my heart feels at home
i'm good at like
surprise me
it‚Äôs like how 2010 sounds really recent
sounds like a bad year to me
dammit eyan, i fucking told you to save me some
the second i consume a single carb, all my abs will disappear
i mean, i believe it
i mean, so does getting slapped in the face
girls don't eat cake
i just remembered how i used to wear hoodies in the middle of summer
i mean i'm not aiming high for life, namely because i want to get a red seal for an electrition

especially electritions, that trade is one of the highest deficits in canada
yo same
i am insulted
sylas when sylas steals shyv ult he has her spells for the duration
stop being so popular
i was very on topic thank you
hmmmmm
and how he's such a dad
you wanna play now or later, how you feelin
maybe
will you though?
do talk more
t b h
jeez
yeah that
soo much
games stuck on a black screen
stuck on "entering game"
just remove the 40000
i'm giving my share to the people
does anyone have any recommendations of what kind of parts i should buy for my pc in the spring time?
that was fast
<:gwoiczenthink:390299938250293250>
ok but i feel like there are better ways to do that
are you trying to _reduce_ your job security good sir
for a gfx card
i literally dont know what you're talking about
they need food <:gwaobapepecry:395628671911854081>
sylas
thank you autocorrect
rainy goes gay like 5 times a week, i'm not too worried about it
i mean why don't you say you're bi and get over with it
jesus christ you fucking morons
clearly
same
nobody here was claiming that you said there was something wrong with vanilla
also do most people side with the empire? reddit is like 90% stormcloak lmao
or at least i was
i wonder if those are the same people who turned on nick in fallout 4
ice cream is far more important
or is that mjoll
because usually theres also programming in there
men love boobs and skyrim
place your bets for how long it'll take before we optimize and talk about boobs _in_ skyrim
someone doesnt appreciate c u l t u r e
boobs bring everyone together
that too
also 99% of fake boobs dont work at all like real boobs. the defying of gravity is mesmerizing
i prefer concave chests myself
what, contemplations of anatomical geometry?
definitely.
what's the point of boobs you don't share
no. i was just drawing lol
no  never
can‚Äôt you like both?
butt
lol what do you prefer panda
oh eyan
all the good things hurt you
i actually don't dragonite
excuse me what the fuck
i know what i'm getting you for your birthday next year
<:rooderp:531156967943569410>
fixed it
izi pizi
i see there‚Äôs a party in vc or something
doubtful
i'm having a hard time, just me and booze
rofl
still eatin tho
yeah, i do
define "doesn't look like it's from the ancient era"
sounds about right, dragonite
crap im supposed to be cleaning my room brb
oh its a time limit, but i talk fast and its annoying
i just hated 99% of my classes
i cant write like anything
maybe. its a speech.
lucky
math. no. bad.
imma forget 90% of this speech
does your teacher spend like 45 minutes yammering about eye contact every single class too
people seem suprised by 500+ a lot
dont worry
arkada draw something else
i could, but i don't want to leave my other friends
<:roodab:509458870700212235>
wonder how much work it would be to make my own
you rang
hmmmmmmm
later nerds, i need to focus
my presence is a privilege
eyan
to panda
rainy, come back
you guys still in vc
i wasted a lot of time tonight doing this
was just playing read dead when my xbox account randomly signed off, so the game restarted because i had to pick my account again and i have to replay a side quest. üòë
hmmm
perv
and my current xcom character honestly looks exactly like me
i had a pixie cut in 2015, haven't cut it since
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
but i let them order

rainy dont be rude to the one who can have you decapitated
there are things i should probably do but i dont feel like doing them

eh, that's your problem then
it's less maintaining health and more shifting dependencies
good morning <:roohi:510305569475657740>
debatable
what is sarcasm?
i gotta work a short shift this afternoon
work
eyan, let me post in black omen
free game
one of my actual faves
hmm tfw i can't get audio unless i use my capture card ~_~
spiderman grapple and parkour mechanics, it's good
wow rude
i never claimed it to be honorable, lol
cause i usually do beserker: alteration, two handed, light armor
i've done a fair number of nord playthroughs so usually two-handed, either light or heavy armor, block and then depending on the playthrough, ice magic, speech, enchanting, or maybe tossing in some one handed and block
what kind of warrior?
<:treason:396483914803445761>
guys one of these days we need to tie master and candyman down to chairs and indoctrinate, i mean, re-educate, i mean, enlighten them
9:27 am] king of zeal: i am a dumbass and rainy is too good for me.

my life
play the song
no wait
why do i only hurt the people i love
no u
gottem
wait are you trying to send me to gulag for wrongthink?
by that do you mean you will be nice to master and master alone, or do you mean you will be nice to master and literally not do anything else?
imagine if someone complained about being thirsty, and they had water easily available to them, and you tell them to go get some of that water, and then they don't, and they continue to complain about being thirsty.
when people talk to each other, they never say what they mean. they say something else and you're expected to just know what they mean.
this body is older, but my residency in it is more recent.
gayest 7 year old i've ever seen
god dammit
i'm actually a pretty productive member of society all things considered
i'm just excited for joker's gameplay trailer
emptiness is the only truth of life
it was the weirdest thing ever
ignore dragonite he fuels bad habits
you can put meaning into it, if ya want, if you're into that kidna stuff.
whoa whoa, where's my invite?
trying things you haven't before is a good start.
i don't know
unfortunately it is
like not crash constan - oh wait it does that too
butt wasn't an option
i just have a copy of photoshop from 2007 that i keep reusing the install code for over and over
it doesnt support animated png though which sucks
but with less words
i mean  i have made some shit in premier like that edit i made that i sent to the meme chat
i quite liked pinnacle, but that was before i knew what true editing power was like
and i like typing words
it was crap
or at least i assume it was in like 2001
the movie maker template titles you used to use at the beginning of your nsmb were legendary
no but really when i was 14 and had no idea how people cut video together and opened up movie maker for the first time, it was literally magical
most of my problems were from me being stupid
and also it's honestly way more cutthroat at the bottom of the ladder (and the middle, and the top) and way less "hey let's have fun" now
same squid
you call me a dumbass
anything else i can explain for you, sweetheart?
i honestly think i'm just gonna shoot to do my weekly series idea and any let's playing i do will be a side project for fun
it's just not particularly my style to call somebody i find endearing a "dumbass" lol
oh, i know it's your style, thus why i didn't take it as a downright insult, lol
cause newsflash dumbass, be it one way or another, i like you, i don't call people i don't like dumbass
angela did plenty of playful banter with me that i was cool with.  the problem she struggled with was when i wasn't in the mood and she upset me, she took it personally.  / shrug
it just doesn't really work well on me
i can do playful banter to an extent, but if i'm not in the mood for it or not particularly prepared for it, i can read it the wrong way
i hope all of your depression is smited away
which is the perfect message for the new guy to see upon joing the server
welcome, have a baconator üçî
if one's not in the mood, we just cool it and support instead
ahh yes
how are you today?
my personal issue with that
but let me post something in blackomen
~~cause i'm real good at sucking dick~~
i'm sure i could make myself hot
i count anything within one states distance "my area" with the exception of upstate new york
eyan very much rigidly defined everyone's perms on blackomen
but you know me
previews on
jesus
in more ways than one
pretty sure i'm the only one from new jersey
no but i've taught him all the memes so he could probably convince people that he is
i refuse to be upstaged by ninja bartender
hd supply can burn in hell
respectable
uh, not really
that's about the best way to put it.
he's probably got one of the less accented skyrim voices
where i live, we say yinz
i can hear him say the line in my head though, lol
oooh, you're from across the pond
five what
here
off to a real life ceilidh in a few minutes with an american friend
something something 52!
also from pennsylvania as it happens
although she still claims to have won the superbowl
i speak from a sports perspective
why do people not like philly again
pretty tame if you ask me
well
you weren't alive in 1994
status update grandma hates that the calculator i pulled up has trig functions and wants a more simple one
2010s: "we have too may features, get rid of something"
we live in a society
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
alright, but you have to feed me as well
but italian is probably safe
what kind of food do you like?
it's no secret i'm picky
i've cooked for many picky friends and partners
and i love spicy, but i'm good at preparing food so it's mild and goes well with variable hot sauces
or at least it is for me now
i had a friend who wouldn't eat anything with any form of tomato in it at all, and italian is my specialty
but that's the fun <:gwaobapepecry:395628671911854081>
we're not friends anymore
which one
good
actually that's not true once i made this thing with chicken that came out okay. what was it called? i have no idea. how did i make it? i have no idea.
because if you don't bake your pasta you can go to hell
lmao
<:gwoicfidgetthinker:390299944910848000>
historically people have needed far few reasons to do things than they have to not do things
a squid walks into a bar.
so the correct wording would be "a squid _squelches_ into a bar"
i don't know what i want to do right now
i never said i objected
uhhhhhhhh
otherwise it gets kinda illegal, lol
well i find your frequently retroactive tact entirely amusing and charming
and i find your vocabulary and sentence structure equally as charming
also furret are just under two meters long
sounds hot
just realized baro is probably in town
that's what a koffing is for
glaceon is best though
i liked rosalia but couldn't catch them because i had emerald, but then 4th gen happened and oh god did i love roserade
restore health in hail rather
of course, as a trainer, steel types are obviously my favorite
yeah, i only know the 4th gen meta, lol
it's starts to get muddled after what i listed off
i totally might not
to show you
ice body restore health in rain
he said jpg not jpeg
primarina's nice but rowlett can move its face independantly of its head
although i do reallly like milotic, easily in my top ten
perfect
i like mismagius more than honchcrow
i got distracted
more jpeg as ordered
it's probably an odd fetish of mine, but damn do wedding dresses get me going
purple things
i always liked weiss
and then i shall be in pittsburgh in 27 hours and we will be watching rwby
i just know that i'd supposedly love the scythe girl
spooky
i want one
qrow is better
does amazing rwby art
also
one sec
i also like this one
whats that
i was lied to
gladly
so even he doesn't know
define normal?
oh, i have a good folder system, don't worry
understandable
well, iris heart did
if we're posting art
not plutia
fit for posting
rainy why do you do this to me
look
i heard something about birdbox(?)
my art folder was out of sfw stuff anyways
last village is already gone
also, i didn't know i could get more attractive either
ironically the smash censorship was a blessing for less than sfw images of mythra
i mean yeah that too
there are other security measures
fukc
realmaster, i am hurt that you think that way of me
but that‚Äôs effort
i liked peach back in brawl, she was probably like, maybe my 4-5 that i'd occasionally play when i was bored of my mains
that's actually pretty cool
but gay
please if i'm stupid then that would make everyone else
even more dumb if i'm being honest
terraria is a game i really really really want to actually muddle through solo, but friends just make it a lot more fun
i just like this artist's style a lot
smug dead inside zelda is me
okay, but in game if mario doesn't touch a flag or axe every 500 seconds he dies
wanna bet rainy?
i don‚Äôt like rushing
or are you talking about smash?
and the 3d games where there's a timer
what im trying to say is theyre not the most rational of people
but people can "progress" like, 3 bosses worth of gameplay in an hour or two if they move quickly so if you decide to build a nice home, suddenly, you're playing catch up or just being gifted gear upgrades
we never said that he was rational with this
what is my corpse supposed to turn into a furret?
i'm gonna say it's short for babylon
i'll stream after i eat which is right now, bbl
if i'm to be a furret i better learn surf and headbutt
oh it's not you
maybe 12?
or be choked, i'm not picky
well still, either way agitation falls under that category
and no 9k, i prefer the latter, but it's all about the participlants
i should probably join stream but i'm listening to someone play jurassic park music on the french horn
why is my life so complicated
but french horns
i looked up the simpsons rating

stop
mr stark

this is a very complicated family tree
if candy gets to be thanos
that
scarlet witch
how did i do that
wait
cause she's a bad bitch
that parts important
can confirm; i fall asleep best around 4 pm
and she dies
!skram
is that like a handicap for "playing without normal metabolic process" or something
just go to the arctic circle
sounds like a terrible design decision
keep speaking like  tierzoo and im gonna flick your nose
food for thought
pretty sure living on your own is adopting yourself
actually just gonna start smacking your nose with a newspaper like a dog
higher damage but with some recoil if you're not wearing a glove
alright back to streaming
but fuck i'm cute when i put effort into how i look
tho buying the expansions after getting the base game doesn't extend that time
people keep telling me i should play ff14
your hotbars get overwhelmed
i was told
sigh
whalecum
boop
well then.
you're not wrong, i generally learned better off on my own, problem was, i'd just cream, lol
4 minutes into the new stephen & friends: gta online episode, and i'm already loving every second of it
luckily my school was all right with that but i wasn't gonna worry about it either way
i saw it earlier; it‚Äôs pretty good
listen mate thighs are god's gift to us and no one can convince me otherwise

sup bitches, your queen graces you with her presence
~~they are if you know they have a dick and you want them because of that~~

hill[]
if you don't kill/die looking good, what's the point.
depends on what would be on the burger but likely burger
i miss her
this lesson doesnt look that long and it looks super interesting
if my view of the course is correct i'll be nearly 2 - 3 chapters ahead
is there like a clean version or something that seems like it would be a common kind of survey to make
also hai draco and xeon
they have most of high rock in it and it's pretty likely that that's where es6 is taking place
i've been having a lot of fun with lucas
pk flash/freeze - freeze looks cooler
pk thunder - lucas's goes through people
can't really say for 4, because i didn't get the dlc for that one
top 10 photos taken seconds before disaster
psi magnet - the one ability that i actually prefer on ness
uh ok
that won't help
does it ever strike you how odd the naming of final fantasy x-2 is
pk fire - knockback on lucas, wall of fire on ness. personally prefer the knockback
nope
final fantasy 100
i can confirm this
super mario land 2 comes after super mario bros 3
what does that even mean
god fucking bless
bloodthirster also has +3 to both attack and damage rolls
+9 to hit +11 to damage is still really good
what the hell are these queue times
somecallmejohnny finally noticed me
i enjoy speedruns, particularly the mario and zelda ones
it was never my intent to deceive
so, rainy's evil, and she doesn't have laziness holding us back
but gluttony counters pride, and sloth counters avarice, and those two sins are me summed up, so i've no time for the others
lol, literally just saw that tweet
a lot of people we hate are the people we realize we have stuff in common with
(you remember kevin, right drago?)
the latter
night my dude, gl hf don't die
everyone deserves a good night
you go outside and have a wonderful day this instant young man
y'all ever just stay up till 1 30 am and imagine yourself in a fantasy setting
you beautiful person you
yea you'd want that huh
i wish you would talk here more because i like having you around
shoe's on the other foot now huh?
i just like palutena
i've found this discourse immensely nice if we're gonna go there

i should also head to bed
~~kingofskarmory.~~
i keep thinking about my weekly series idea, i really want to do it, lol
pretty much
work isn't really supposed to be fun, lol
yeah but- dammit
lmaooo
i won't be dying for the next several thousand years, so i would prefer to spend less of it feeling lonely.
also good morning darling, and the rest of you lot
eh, details
i always feel like i scare people off when i'm here
time to play skyrim... when i get home...
technically yes, but if you just want to send me something to listen to, no
have you tried mountains?
bring a laptop with you for low work days or when it's snowing
also, we're not understaffed, we just value actually working at work, sort of
out of curiosity pm
i like how dragonite says nothing about the 3ds in that photo
he is still sitting there
i mean, don't get me wrong, she, is hot
yup, gen 5 is best
wait a minute i can just slap him in the face and be satisfied with that
eh w/e
sure
ok i have a better solution
okay, but look her up on the internet
but the generation as a whole
cats are the solution
nvm, you're good then
that too
cats
it was an honest question
they should have made cynthia playable in dppt then gen 4 would have been objectively the best
currently replaying the original version of bowser's inside story
my kitty, ryu
guns? are you playing the mtg version?
3 if you count the stray that collette looked after for a while, but it wasn't her cat by any means

civil engineering is a hellhole like no other
if they think the software is too slow on the currently existing machines
i'd pick the bible on that one
demon is that special type of normal where he's 'normal' with a bit of 'weird' but not too weird and must be protected at all costs
bella you need to be less normal
but raptors
i'm normal <:gwahreeweebrage:370265985787101187>

i have sheets for mobile installed and it's about as fun as poking myself in the eye with a nuclear bomb that's in the middle of detonating
how big are they compressed (as xlsx)?

well not entirely but i'd only bought like five of them mostly out of boredom but still
that is entirely correct
i've got a new pet peeve

at least in chemistry,
the only walkthroughs i havent watched
let's make a correction, i did go in 2017, he just didn't see me there, lol
you were at thrown controllers in 2018 though right? that means there was at least one point where i was at most 150 feet away from you and didnt see you
i missed 2017
i was invited to the phi theta kappa society at my cc today and i know little to nothing about it but apparently it's becausse of all the maths i've done
well math, not kugal
what would i be reincarnated as
i could google it
i could also not google it
don't worry, he'll be going to the next one
im such a proud parent
they basically just offer and encourage scholarships for the most part
plus im young and i think they have like an age limit on it probably
ehhhhhhhhhhh
i should probably go shower, later folks
have fun
whenever i tell my friend im about to shower he says "stay safe, be smart, have fun, keep your eyes on the prize" and that is just too underrated
don't worry i just made a terrible joke
say godnight, skarm
being a 2000s kid has it perks xd
maybe he's saying you go out and put your computer down
night night skarm
or dont
but then how would we get memes like 5 / 3 * 3 != 5
uhhh
i guess not
they use dialog thats a little different and change the visuals so they arent spoilery
at worlds end
i was watching the super bowl just like 99.9% of humanity,
im so out of the loop on avengers
>watching superbowl like 99.9% of humanity
by the way rc im 50+ hours into xenoblade and figured out what chain attacks do
something like that
well theres 7 billion people
everyone always knew that
the fridge likes the d? <:kappapride:379352530863521792>
i don‚Äôt think so
so then 30 of .3 is like .09 which might as well be .1
kugal why is there a d in fridge but no d in refrigerator
just be sure to keep pace with your physics courses too
nice
~~no, the individual. you d-nglehead~~
if i decide not to take diff. equations and calc 3 at the same time, which should i take first
not at this cc
in a way, diff. equations is *kinda* a calc 4? except not really
then sometime after that is like trig-sub and partial fractions which i spent my whole winter break practicing so im not too worried on my performance on that
parametric derivatives were simple enough, but something tells me parametric integration is gonna get messy
exactly
momentum, that shit was fun
your weeks 1 and 2 are what we're doing right now
so i spent like 2 whole pages explaining everything in detail and showed every goddamn step
why am i not surprised at the result of the game?
actually most of them were kind of meh
i understand sportsball now
theyre not as bad as like english or something but like it's not code
i've never had beef dumplings *kugal said, surprising no one*
<:doit:334014889137930240>
also, without listening to what i linked, i'm strongly guessing it to be based on either "a soul as red as a ground cherry" or "apparitions stalk the night"
those two songs are two of my more favorite touhou songs, that's why i know them and a lot of their remixes well.  probably just cause of nostalgia since that was more or less how i started playing touhou
for me, it's "mystic dream ~ snow or cherry petal" and "paradise ~ deep mountain".  thanks to you even.
ive been living and dreaming about xenoblade for the last six days
my calc ii grade is at 105% so im like in heaven
impressive
well, i was talking more on the lines of mario 3.
and i haven't even gotten to ice world yet as well
maybe if i see an extra on the store shelves in the future, i'll get it and subsequently mod it to add tetris attack and more.
drawing
i want something.
okay, somehow managed to get almost 13 seconds against piston hurricane on super punch-out
music or drawing?
and yeah, the fan community is insane in what it has produced.
she'll be okay with it
well a 30lb clock will do that to it
bad news is my files might be fucked and so ill be completely left in the dust for school work/progress
i much more prefer it to be colder
you should let it fall from a great height and clock you on the head
while i get a new computer im using a computer connected to a huge 4k tv as the monitor
get yo shit together
i love how last week nc was 12 degrees and freezing rain and now 85 and sunny
that's my point
heelies do sound like a huge liability in a military situation
what is that?
oh wait that's not what i said
last september ended a long time ago ida
~~pinning the blame on drago, are we~~
i don't know what age these girls are supp - wait
that was an interesting conversation üòÇ
it appears not.
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
haha, sure, but after this one xd
even if they'll probably need a bit of help to sustain it
king dipshit
i'm starting to wonder if literally having a cheaper cpu than my mom's computer might be a bad idea
idk acts are ass anyways
i enjoy the way my computer basically locks up when i'm trying to do things like export a video
i just asked and my homeroom teacher said that wasnt true
exactly skarm
hmmm
i'm always here...always watching o.o
greetings, eyan.
never mind
i don't think i'm making that deadline
it'd just be trollier on april fools because nobody will believe it, lol
but i had to have too much "delay" between the trailer and return
never mind, stream is cancelled
eyan if you don't stream on friday, i will cry.
the hard part is getting started, and staying started, if i get past that bump, i'll be rolling
okay
he wouldn't even cuddle me last night, the heartless bastard.
usually
sadly
emotions are annoying
you just want to enjoy the meal
so, a squid can have more <:kappa:374346980136058893>
same
i don't feel functional though
i think coffee is the only reason i‚Äôm not useless right now.
my typical sleep seems to be 13 hours
i‚Äôve got a class coming up where my prof is just nonstop talking at us... so u don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôll go
does anyone know if there's a beverage that will give me an irresistible desire to do my homework
i could get away with it though, because again, good at self-study
you aren't wrong, but there's this thing called your "degree" that is important to show off
i never really felt compelled to go on the internet during class, despite the fact that most of them so far have been in computer labs
kind of like drinking  üòõ
unless it‚Äôs one of those rare classes, people just zone out
at this point, i'm probably better off just having some fun with a fresh start and if it doesn't go anywhere, at least i can say i gave it one last try
what‚Äôs outdoors?
some of us have weird hobbies okay
yeah i guess
or i could be wasting time on discord
my favorite google translate tip has to be switching the language 50 umpteen million times before switching it to english
i mean
hmmm
what if instead of eyan having the bob ross mod or learning how to do it himself, he got a sound board which he could use for every single bob ross phrase and word for the videos
that sounds like what your graduating project would be
although it'd be ironic if uninstalling reinstalling it worked
i'm here to learn not fuck up my internals more than my computer already does
master was mostly wrath sloth and pride
yeah me too
i'm going to take all that youve done and make it as spaghetti as possible
that's less fun though
oh right i should do that
it's not that hard in sinnoh tbh
mom discovered cat videos today
just like life
is that your celebration for cracking three thousand lines of spaghetti skarm
ok then
does it only work for you and rainy because if it's anything like the back counter it's probably going to get trolled
e!drink
everyone else can do e!drink
e!drink
my new favorite file extension
pretty sure strings are truthy as are positive integers so it would just return true anyway
e!drink1
skarm bugger off
at least you seem to be somewhat trying
anyways, that's just what i can think of off the top of my head without watching the video
yeah i was gonna mention that
for example, i found the gap i mentioned is just boring, even with one team flare battle
a lot of the gap between 6 and 7 is just traversing the snow routes and fighting two fights with the commanders that really should've been separated more
i feel like i could put out a part to an lp each day off or days where i don‚Äôt work until late afternoon, but i‚Äôm lazy and i like not doing work on days off. so...
i enjoy just working my way through the game working on the pokedex and having a cool team
2 of my pokemon are 4x weak to ice and one of em is 2x weak
in my playthroughs i always like using the same pok√©mon as the rival character
most creative i've been able to get is teaching thunderpunch and thunder fang to my gallade and gliscor respectively
exp share plus anything that can learn fire type moves
eyan you can also be the biggest les - there is no way for me to salvage this sentence is there
actually i've got nothing
only cowards aren't lesbians.
thank you mr burnham
having self respect is for losers
i'm a guy who likes girls does that count or am i a coward too
hahahahahahahaha no
ok but have you tried exoblade?
reasons to marry me. gym membership, free medical, free dental, free life insurance, free house
how long has it been since surgery?
do your eyes feel like that?
none of those are cats
"if you want a grass team, start by considering your horrible life choices"
im amazed that people still play or plan to play plat
no clue
d/p then
they were both at the same levels in diamond and pearl, right?
yeah. although, i just battled koga and his team in yellow was really fucking stupid
meylene's lucario was 32
but you can do 5-7 in any order
3 venonat and 1 venomoth
and for some reason pryce's pokemon are lower level than jasmine's
that's with clair
where the hell did you catch an electabuzz
also, i remember being far higher leveled than that
lemme check real quick
i wish i still had my pokewalker
actually, that's a lie
still wish i had one.
greetings.
what's up gamers
why not just be alloy then?
i at least assume they want you to at least be in your late 30s given the fact that clair's kingdra is level 41
the x is silent
that sounds like an organization xiii name or something.
yeah, that's the name of the secret-secret fifteenth member of the organization
i thought i shared this important piece of culture already, huh
if there's an x in their name that is pronounced, they're part of the organization
not to be confused with xxx the rating, or xxx, vin diesel's popular action hero character.
i accidentally put
and that's no. xvi, who's also their janitor
someone help i'm cold and borex
somehow i read that as "i'm cold and a board"
didn't he get arrested for a dui
i'm sure you all have some very interesting theories about that
youtube keeps showing adds for apps that look like softcore hentai games or something. and they say they‚Äôre trying to make the website more family friendly...
it's snowing but at the same time sunny
it's probably going to be my 2019 goty since i don't think pokemon can impress me at all compared to this xd
good choice
in other news i can now say i'm fly bi and ready to die
my favorite game is a 3 way tie between chrono trigger, xenoblade, and pokemon gen 4
fuckin cute ass traps.
well pretty sure you can beat it with your fists
diamond is slightly more nostalgic to me, since it was the first pok√©mon game i beat. but i can‚Äôt play it over platinum, with how slow it is
yo 9k, lemme get a "this close to greatness"
every issue i've had with it aside from pacing issues that plague every pokemon game can be fixed by just developing it on better hardware
being ~~sick as~~ an adult sucks
yeah
btw i'm alive
my favorite part about that is that it comes up immediately if you google anime galatians 4 16
congrats
the question is do i want to do school over the summer again
what about what i may say
i get death
partly that, and also ocd is really starting to hate me for not winning the 100cc cups.
that was fun
if you feel like doing more with this, maybe increase the one handed skill of known owners of the books
having a stable economy

sleep
i'm allergic to that particular variety of not-dragon
good pin
rainy you are under arrest for masterhackering without a license
i object orient
farcry new dawn let's me have a cybernetic arm, game of the year
so there's a bunch of pcmr people who inhabit the computer lab and theyve been getting progressively noisier and i finally complained about them to the tech support desk
that means not rolling math.random() >.5 ) for each person in the population at once but rather exponentially doing so for each species from the point of origin
thats dumb
unrelated but managing the main branch of git seems slightly wrong at times
huh so your math wasnt wrong
fortunately he doesn't use them too much.
uhhh
>twice
i need somebody to explain 39 degree snow to me
ida why are you still awake
grade average
that's how i ended up with a 106 in precalculus the one semester they rounded my grade down to 100
and i did it in like two days because i don't have anything to do
old indeed.
aqua the picture says platinum not heartgold
didn't know stanley was part of this server
does it have a recurring reminder feature?
what about soulsilver drago
except for the part where it was rounded down
i see
yo candy
is this the birth of a meme?
i am looking at the memes
i have no idea when i beat chrono trigger btw
all my friends do, though.
nothing wrong with being envious, as i am generally envious of all of you guys.  i feel like an old man now, lol
~~can you tell i‚Äôm a little bit envious lmao~~
don't get me wrong demon_lord, honestly, being an adult is nice
most of my stress i put on myself.  it comes from a place of thinking i should be something more than i currently am.
nah that's understandable
i have that
i don't think i ever really "had it together" but it at least felt like it back in high school and early college, lol
the part ic ant wait to enjoy as an adult is the not talkign to people you dont wanna talk to part
in terms of family though you're right kugal, and trust me, i know a thing or two about that
guys wanna hear a funny story
you set your expectations of us just a wee bit too high
again, probably
at this point i'll need meth to do more math
this week im gonna join phi theta <:kappa:374346980136058893> wish me luck
i'm going to try to stream a bit this week, i'm currently eyeing up tomorrow
i've gotten really hung up on the question of "to rebrand or not to rebrand" again when it comes to youtube.
i'd say that's still a succes.
good
no way he's giving these puns a rest anytime soon
i don't know
i feel like pain should be quadratic but momentum is usually used for interactions between bodies
or something
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
i feel like that would be force
i did bomb my calc midterm, i know the feeling.  üòõ
then a week later i got the grade and saw i got 97% and i was probably the happiest i've been since ever
eyan are you making fun of me
i never plan to be some hardcore body builder, but just some light exercises here and there are better than nothing
muscle tone is just refining what's there, not actually gaining more.
we've been doign it since 1/7/19 and im at 1663 pushups total
draco, my friend, funny of you to think i have any muscle, lol
yeah, i agree, and there's too many little things i haven't done for far too long
it's the little things, they make a lot of difference
what kind of hw
we all think our buds can do awesome shit but we think we're mediocre
get back to work. üòõ
i have a bad feeling about this
greetings, aloix.
and now no one‚Äôs here
good luck friend
have fun
nah i went with the brad bread pun
wow same what a coincidence
that is alot of potatoes üëÄ ü•î
not sure what those are.
red mage can be seen as a mix of black mage and white mage but also has it's own unique mechanics.
the gauges fill by casting spells associated with black and white mage respectively.
twin vipers
it actually is the one with the rapier tho
given that i never use gil, neat.
rainy is more keen on warframe and it's obviously 9ks bread and butter so i feel like it doesn't make sense for me to switch games when i primarily use online games to be social
i know the feeling all too well.
i play on jenova in the aether data center for example.
i'm with the maelstrom btw
xiv is an mmorpg, eyan. üòõ
~~so sorry~~
~~rightfully so~~
~~thanks friends~~
pretty sure i play on behemoth
though we can't all pine for goth gfs
some of us must be the goth gfs
you didn't even give me a chance to respond
because all men are like that, so i figured if i'd date a man it should probably be my favourite one.
that‚Äôs actually a nice way to put it
e!drink 1
look, you don't have to be around me, lol
bite me
you knew what you were getting into
peace with oblivion
is it though?
we need to refractor the code then
rude
have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree and take to the air?
ida remind me where is it that you live
~~wait, i already am one~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
good job
that sounds like a bionicle or yugioh thing
shooting the apple of the head?
yeah i want my butthole to suffer when i poop later
will you kill me afterwards?
it really pissed me off tbh
but i hold the apple in my mouth
if you want
again
welcome
rare or mr
red meat is amazing for the soul
like sucking?
yeah but anyway...
indeed it did, my youtube stuff hasn't gone as planned so i want to hop back into streaming while i continue to pull myself together.
personally, i prefer medium well
ü§î hmmmmm
i mean
oh yeah, isn't that fangame called flames of eternity?
cynthia is hot *and* cool
steven is second best
anyways i take it you're subbed to the temple of mythra
hey :( i'm an adult :(
look
yes but he collects rocks
it's fun to say
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
i'm going to be 25 next month
wait actually
i hear it works great
it won't allow me to update or uninstall anything.
brb making one of these
takes one to know one
xkcd and singing
who the hell is argo
replacing aids with depression is new to me tho
aqua i answered b for all of them except for the one my mouse slipped and hit c on and i think that was the only one i got right
i consider a 4 on demon lords a win.  üòõ
who are you
ida's is the only one i scored higher than a 4 on, out of like 8 or 9 quizzes total
i made one a little bit ago, mine should actually be semi-reasonable to do okay on.  üòõ
there's really only two questions that are total crap shoots, the rest of them should be feasibly answerable questions.  the first and last being crap shoots unless you're a really really old school fan of mine
i don‚Äôt know eyan as well as i thought i did
i figured "chrono trigger, zeal, makes sense
thanks eyan lol
got a 6 on ‚Äúmr spam‚Äù
i can't believe how everyone is picking the same answer on the ssseven question.  i can't tell if that means you all  recognize the other 6 names and not the one or if it's mere coincidence
everybody i looked at picked the same person on the ssseven question
mine were actually fair but tricky
they're all real people btw
the guy that everybody is answering was probably the only real artist i ever had who helped me out long term.  üòõ
probably cause we recognize the others
that's
you have more confidence than i, but i appreciate it.  üòõ
he got one of his own questions wrong
good job kugal
you are my best friends
doesn't surprise i'd fall for the bait lmao
it's not a good website, lol
ok i don‚Äôt know you but i‚Äôm 102% sure that you‚Äôre not an idiot üòÇ
you'd be surprised
so none of the above is correct?
at least i remembered that
btw, welcome aura, lol
i think i actually selected that
nothing to worry about
well i‚Äôm sure my intelligence is below average
why did my brain start playing the star wars theme when superman was mentioned
though i might just be below average and stupid so
i took a quiz here by accident once
sounds lovely.
thanks auto-correct
inventory was 8:30
well, i woke up at 5.  üòõ
shocker, i know
debatable
peace
wow thanks
this is an interesting bot
wait
i birthed him by javascript and then irradiated hkm with the inanity of discord chat and he's spent most of the last two years geting revenge on me
wow rood
it looks like i slept through an interesting conversation
~~well if the icon comment was directed at me, thank you, if not, i am a confirmed idiot~~
as i can see
so does it just respond whenever you mention it‚Äôs name?
and skarm is probably the most interesting robot i‚Äôve seen
about 8k in total
and violent
perfect.
i mean, naturally, the bot takes most of it's lines from things people say here
he's attached to the ceiling
i can't believe that worked
like
judging by the amount of active support it has nowadays
one person got this right
so apparently there was a bsod during today's thrown controllers, and
wack.
meme
sister: dos? is that punch cards?
i think
hmm i have this paper i have to write for homework
as for him actually crying during an lp, he did at one part in yakuza 0 and one part of the danganronpa 3 anime
somebody pour one out for me
very carefully
boiii
<:lul:528108303939665920>
sister: "if you could be a bug, what kind of bug would you be?"
that's what i'd be
i like how quickly you had an answer to that
and it an probably survive whatever life throws at it
<:surprised_ghost:492379339032363018>
forewarning
ty ty nice to meet you too
welcome!
what happens if you‚Äôre already dead though
death: the sequel
looks like you're doing it
oh yeah that‚Äôs right
sounds fun
welp
(Ôºç‚Ä∏·Éö)
he only responds to phrases with four or more words, and there's like a ten second cooldown
interesting
when in doubt, use reverse psychology
wow rude
i‚Äôll be over in a bit
i'm gonna need a fresh pair of chopsticks cause these ones are used now
idk about ivs
true
super training gives more direct control.
yeahhhhhh id much rather shoot balloons than wait
something always has to break the chain for me before i can even get into shiny encounter territory
how is that fun exactly?
sounds like a design flaw
from now on i'm calling morgana's w spooky dirt
henlo people‚Äôs or cactuses or whatever you identify as
all my mods are "do you hate yourself? play this!"
for the age of agression is just about done
on the day of your death we will call it a feature
on the day that npm finally breaks we'll drink and we'll sing
but in truth it's been there all along
absorb the words that way
i'm thinking of walking out the door and being a hermit on a mountain somewhere
i also sat around yesterday thinking of how i didn't want to do my taxes.  then i finally did them late at night and the whole day was wasted
yeah, spent on investments
isn't that just paying other people to use your money and then giving you some back as thanks once they're successful?
i don't like super hero movies
and.
recommended
the thing
well fuck. guess i stand corrected after all
lmao
i can blame whatever i want for my code not working
skarm that's inappropraite
don't blame me for your code not working
you shouldn't put your keyboard all the way down there because youll have to reach down for it but that's an easy fix, 9/10 overall
so how exactly did nintendo leak something from their own game again?
is that the actual script
i don‚Äôt remember the reading rainbow song
that's still like seven more people than there should be
it's the average value of how pissed dragonite is when the pcmr people are in the computer lab
yesterday evening
finally bothered to finish
i thought rainy is best ass
sithis does not accept such as valid payment
rainy i need you to take care of my bot for me
i just like to see the world burn
they think they're too good for lists
im this tempted to pull up a khan academy practice quiz now because of you
my hand is dead and my brain has short circuited
why did nobody tell me i would've done this so much sooner
twitter just gave me an ad that said, in essence, "not smoking is gay, gay is good, don't smoke, be gay" and it's honestly an impressive level of targetted advertisement
he's pretty enthusiastic about it while a lot of other people that i see are cynical about it and see it as something to deal with
me at 13: woah dragons
me at 18: woah dragons
not when yorue allergic to them
i feel betrayed ida
yet the store was normal sized
i also had a dream where i was going to the beach except i was riding down the parkway on a bicycle which also happened to be flying
oh my god
how interesting

me now: woah cats
that's a very pretty diagnostic message which i would totally remove from the channel the normal message is sent in except i think it's funny when people question it
that policy would've made freshman year move along a lot faster
not enough
not enough
aa is life
we live in a walmart?
our target is really nice
to make them even better theres a five guys across the parking lot from mine, so that gives me an excuse to go there too whenever we need dog food or toilet paper or bananas or whatever
smithed for the first time today!
skarm how you feeling
nice
~~who the hell tells master their last name~~
e!xkcd
ah ok thx
because i‚Äôve invested hours into it and now i‚Äôm training it to level 100
it's actually releasing tomorrow?
i was beginning to wonder if would be out this month
yes, i literally did in my playthrough with eyan
i‚Äôve always wanted a scizor
ahh yes, mega "the testers gave up on me so badly that i ended up getting kicked out of the dumpster fire tier" rayquaza
116-290 base power
i love this monster
the monster i love happens to be luxray despite a shallow movepool and breeding necessity in order to get ice fang
guts facade on swellow is the only competitive move i need, change my mind
always thank the baker
bread has carbs
i would marry bread.
i drinks oil straight from the alaskan pipeline
fucking yankees

i want em
kugal how the crap do you just leave four whole slices of pizza
i'll tell yea how
my dad has some slices too
tonight i have 2
i 100% agree
flourishing?
at least i'm not suffering alone
yeehaw, time for two and a half hours of suffering
when does one desire to be disturbed
welp
i have yet to be consistently active here so i may never know
wow now if only that was the case with school
i think the most expensive we‚Äôve gotten is $3.99
i wonder if i can get eyan to buy me one
should have done electric scooters
to be fair its not a class you try hard in anyway
e!google bicycle prices
but regardless, you get an
i'll patch at least
i am

i‚Äôm the most hatable person i know
i hate white people

all are valid catastrophes, all seen over by some uhh, friends of mine
feck
well it'll be the cessation of cardiovascular functions for my scenario
just like
about primal groudon‚Äôs desolate land ability
oh i will be flooding the earth
the moniker rainy is not a hollow one
its becoming an undying jello that is part of a collective conscience
i'm out of tables to flip, do you have any i can borrow?
i mean, i have a god complex
meanwhile i‚Äôm limited to just that
i use the maruchan noodles but never their seasoning, i do that myself
just don't remember that you can't cook
no its lesbian
the integral question
if i like a guy
that's pretty gay
but it's the gay club
honestly, i don't know the acronym
that‚Äôs gay
that‚Äôs gay
rainy is dating sneaky?
you‚Äôre like
same
ida's gay?
photosynthesis is hot
like the barista that asked me to dinner the other day, and i just said "i don't eat dinner"
i genuinely don't eat dinner though, so like

thanks that's now burned into my rain
thank
the only thing of my own that i pinned was the time i was yelling at people for being dicks to each other, all of my other bad ideas were actually master's bad ideas
e!pins
sorry if i'm mistaken, but wasnt a youtube return scheduled for early april?
it's oaky ida
my thought process on rebranding is, i'm older, different, and want a fresh start.  there's also no point in me returning to youtube, not enjoying myself, and then burning out in a month.
i decided to put a little more time into getting my life together but youtube is still a definite goal of mine.  i told myself april originally just to try to push myself as a motivator but i always new it was going to be later than that.
cool
eyan i didnt know today was opposite day
i was reminded that joke exists yesterday
and i just call him bby or dumbass
your personal favourites as in games?
if anyone else calls him dumbass, i am allowed to kill them tho
wasn't your latest review of that bingo gba game?
eyan aren't you still at work?
~~we need a new video of that bingo game~~
my name is very cryptic.
as do i, it's a lot easier to push a rolling stone
they‚Äôre singing a skyrim song
damn i dont understand any of these references
someone politely asked eyan about youtube
what did i miss?
was it singing or shouting, mr. spam?
cause i can do like three shots before my taste buds say no, or i could do an infinite number of shots in cocktails
this means i am all set to be an alcoholic again
and i'm not gonna be able to cosplay lady if i am drinking sprite with... calories, eugh
o no
~~happy 4/20 day~~
greetings, ida.
and decently long hair
not to mention i‚Äôve gotten them twice
no, not yet. if they did, they might as well make fang moves for the other types
to be fair if it can eat it can bite you so everything short of some electric shit like magnemite should be able to
god tier fang move
dragon fang, not to be confused with the actual held item
plus stab
plus flinch
because
and when **marked as duplicate** beckons every one of us dies
not sure
looks like a fun set though
he wants the wig to die
trebuchet launching dr bright with a chainsaw
i‚Äôve never actually competitively battled in my life so yeah according to the interwebs i‚Äôm making a mistake here but hey, luxray is my favorite
answer is in character. i expect nothing less
probably it isn‚Äôt good in terms of others out there that you could use but it‚Äôs a unique one. i think it‚Äôd be more fun than the generic stuff
i want to die
yeah, now i‚Äôm pretty sure with the right supporting cast, it could hold its own really well
once you‚Äôve read at least 10 entries (recommendation to start with the ones i listed) you can have a go at scp-001
wow there is a whole lot going on
i like that there‚Äôs all redacted stuff
yeah but sometimes it is an excuse for lazy writing
okay after like 32 minutes i got one with a jolly nature. would an adamant or jolly luxray be better?
the time wee burn in the name of pok√©mon
but i suppose the "people" part doesn't really fit
usually
for like the 7th time in the last 2 hours
henlo

indeed
"will that be all for you today?"

good ol newegg, selling things for half the price as the rest of the internet somehow

its more important that there's a spot on the mobo rather than a slot on the case
anyway im bookmarking this, probably going to come back to it even if i can make elgato not make modern art because it would be useful for other things
and 8 sata ports on the mob
you like to carve your own path
but anyway make sure your motherboard has an extra one of these open
i could probably google it but it's not like i need an excuse to open up my computer so i'll do that when i'm done with this mess

that sounds lewd out of context but quite honestly i don't care
motherboard looks fine

but "gay" is the adjective describing "deci" here so that sounds to me like he wants my tenths to be less gay
i mean
what do you have against garish yellow?  sounds to me like you're racist
same

candyman is the person i hate on the motorways confirmed
or something
i'm usually the guy people speed match with so incase a cop come by it's like 5  cars going the speed limit and looks normal

are they fighting over a bunny in midair
i was actually thinking, like, worse than booty shorts lol
i was on the cross country team so we all wore short-shorts for the entire fall anyway. but there were some students who apparently thought it was normal to go around wearing like, slightly-more-fabric-than-bras or something. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
they tried to prepare us for the "harshness" of high school
people still use that word too?
id be mad if we got uniforms
meanwhile in high school kids are calling people homophobic slurs and stuff like that
guys todays been a rough day for everyone it seems
i went to a school where girls could only wear skirts and its the worst rule. later on we could only wear collared shirts till high school
thats a great idea
cause personally?
all the time
i am insane
probably wouldn‚Äôt go well
bunny codes mad hops
in other, almost as important news
i don‚Äôt miss taking classes
i don't go off of semesters.
bella you still haven't?
didn‚Äôt know that
i dont know how they managed it but its got the flavor to balance out the bitterness, but its all solid? its magical
donuts times syrup dark chocolate divided by bald eagle, if i understood your order of operations
or as a more noble person would use,
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
sometimes i forget y'all are in the same fuckin country as me
i'm at work so i haven't looked at everything, but i feel like this is the first time in quite literally generations of pokemon that i looked at the new pokemon revealed and was like "huh, those are actually kinda likable"
now all i need is a switch...
the more things change the more they stay the same
in other words, that stuff isn't marketed for us
and to give little kids something to go "oooooooh, ahhhhhhh"
i forever stand by the belief that 5th gen is where pokemon changed forever, but it's hard to say exactly how it changed and why
i very much doubt it, the switch is far more powerful
i'm saying hopefully because i don't think we need to see game freak get overly ambitious with what they could do on the switch.
impressiveness has its cost
sorry to interrupt but
oh no
but that's just my opinion, and theory as to what the series is designed to be.
the what
did anyone see the pokemon direct?
welp, just another week and then algetty might blow up from e3
i think it was gen 6, where they introduced a group of friendly rivals, is where it got annoying to me
same
i did
i'm ready for x/y a month ago, i love those games :p
henlo
i agree, i'm more interested in the non legendaries they showed than the legendaries
it's literally just two dogs, one picked up a stick and magic happened, the other got his head stuck in a doggy door and magic happened
and also i thought the legendaries were different variation son the same monster until the narrator said otherwise, which is probably not good for what's going to be on the box art for this cycle
same
i think difficulty is something that nobody should get their hopes up for
>implying that's not normal
and he's getting chased by dog'maw
when‚Äôs all that due?
we've come a long way since then.
got a new car today
me with a knife
and here i am playing terraria
no dont hurt the wooloo it's not allowed
yeah
sometimes it's great
it‚Äôs illegal to hurt the fluffy boi
so my sister named her user account on the switch "voldemort" and chose the yellow pikmin picture
i have watched... two subs? and both of them are thanks to this one dumb, but really cute, weeb that i know
if they're either good or funny bad
you're just a weeb
life has no meaning but that which we give it
that didn't give meaning. it moreso commented on what was seen in existence
664 words to be exact
wait, terraria at e3? 1.3.6 release date plz
(if you ask me he died long ago and his death drove me to madness resulting in my attempt to revive lavos)
now that would be epic
also yeah.... about the rival, i'm expecting a hau 2.0 >___>
wow am i the only one here that actually likes both of these legendaries?
hello, guess who just got a parking ticket for parking like three houses down from the bus stop that i was accused of parking in
~~eyan?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
except instead of parking in a bus stop it was for firebombing a homophobe
no then i could have firebombed the homophobe and then the ticket would have been enjoyable
i guess we know it's his mom he takes after
i honestly thought it would be professor layton or ace attorney
anyway i guess i wont be watching any emile videos for like three more months, since i still need to finish playing it too
and given that he's prob only gonna get one more lp out this year
tbh though
sounds reasonable
but i feel like there would be too many cuts and speed ups for it to go at a reasonable pace
true ^
they're both very good series i recommend heavily
yeah
there‚Äôs better reasons for loans imo
holy piss i did
ngl i feel like that might not go over too well unless someone asks first
‚Äúthat guy can never finish anything‚Äù :v
pride month <:kappapride:379352530863521792>
eyan has still yet to play that on stream <:kappapride:379352530863521792>
to be fair, from the outside it just looks like he up and left for no reason
~~i'm considering doing that, now~~
master stop doing so much work youre making the rest of us look bad
did i manage top comment
which is to say, almost everyone
let'
wait, i was following more than that and twitch just didnt show me them all
just got home and saw the announcement video. i love how one of the top comments was ‚Äúpicking up where superskarmory left off‚Äù
do it you goon :^(
and from what i remember from the video, gen 5 marked a *huge* step up in terms of that.

stupid bot
good job bot
i was ironically thinking of maybe actually doing a chrono trigger playthrough returning to youtube instead of xcom.  =\
but now it'd feel very shadowed, i think i should still stick by xcom
ugh, i wish i could find out if i was getting this job or not, lol
because life is unfair.
i just feel sad now
almost immediately
the king will return and in time zeal shall prosper like never before
it's amazing how this is simultaneously kind of heartwarming that i did have such a legacy while simultaneously wow... i had that legacy...
ive learned that it doesnt take much
you aren't wrong
because i don't know what it would take to make me feel like i could be consistent
brah
yeah thats a solid 2 megatons of friction right there
is definitely not consistent
my channel‚Äôs slow growth probably comes from how inconsistent i am
eyan is that actually the reason it's been held up
i am now down to 154 subscriptions
eyan dont worry im still on your channel
youtube is also not a very stable platform in the slightest. especially in recent years.
i dont think youtube has changed as much as we're not kids anymore
it has
squid im pretty sure that's just you
creativity and stuff going viral has been replaced with regular mediocrity
youtube algorithms care most about the people who show up to youtube and hook themselves up to watching crap for hours
at some point in the past dad discovered videos of elephants painting
so she watches it about six times a day every time she comes over on sunday
literally just meme videos
i kind of want to drink and stream but i don't know what to play
play cthulhu saves the world
league with friends?
thanks premiere
well, thanks for the suggestions guys and gals, i appreciate it!
premiere did it again
i dont know if i should be concerned
i could play a few rounds if you guys get a free spot
the ever ending struggle of should i do youtube again was not an extra stressor that i needed today.  v_v
my bad
just hit it with a hammer
it stole the hammer and punched me in the face
but eh
howdy friends
are they just trolling or did they get a stroke when typing this?
no idea but there are a number of people on the internet who are _actually_ that bad at social skills
ill probably sleep through most of e3 like usual and magically wake up in time for nintendo, bethesda and possibly sony and square
good job sony
it's starting with ea today. i think microsoft's tomorrow
they just having sports and shooters again. the only thing that's actually different is sims 4
so the lawn actually hot mowed fater than i thought
wii baseball was the biggest disappointment in gaming
but it was
don't for the ever popular taking a sword to everyone on the island.
i got annoyed by the loud presenters, so i stopped watching
don't eat chikorita
oh wow i upset chat
update: detective pikachu was very weird, and i am very upset that they did not use the unknown font on all of the signage
plus the real-time meteorological forecast for the entire rest of the video game universe
it's the better cousin of mareep
welcome back
and i talked to a thing
and went where have i heard this before
and then went oh
update:
he are just kid
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
i miss when games intentionally added cheats
i had one of those
a bunch of them were wrong
same
never thought i'd see keanu reeves in e3 at all.
first country roads, now burning ring of fire... sure, bethesda
like literally any game containing fishing
eso has had dragons for a minute mate
that'll probably be in one of the updates in 2038
someone in the chat said "dragons don't make games" and i now understand the desire to murder someone
bella go learn to ride dragons
its the red one with the gas mask
doom eternal is all i can think of
there might've been other stuff, i don't remember.
so e3 starts tuesday then
i actually didnt have my hopes that high for bethesda, i heard they wanted to save starfield and tes until the next consoles come out
there‚Äôs no way tes is this generation ):
square enix can be very hit or miss, and there's no hopes for ubisoft actually getting a not terrible showing
ubisoft is like ea but with slightly better games and slightly less common sense
at this point i'd rather they just push it back to next gen
stronger hardware
i miss my ps2
ive never touched any ps
dont have one
i tried
‚Äúthe story, maybe, we don‚Äôt know anymore‚Äù
"the story so far, probably, maybe, iii.9 delta/2"
there call one of the titles that, mark my words
watchdogs legion is looking good so far
taking back london playing as a 70 year old woman is already a selling point.
there's a dog on the stage now
watching through ubisoft‚Äôs conference now; i always have to turn off the chat for all of these streams because i get tired of seeing everyone hating everything that anyone shows.
commie protections
everyone gets equal protection
actually
the best parts of the bethesda show were the cute girl and that guy who kept yelling
even todd howard cannot save that show
final fantasy vii remake releasing 3/3/2020. sure, square enix, that's not getting delayed.
a tifa out of 10
it's probably already been delayed aobut three times, they just didnt tell us
they certainly did better than i thought they would.
once again
i think so, it's been a day so my memory's a bit hazy
i'm gonna just go and wait another 30 minutes for this direct
same
few things bring me more joy than a delicious cup of pringles
nintendo won
snake, cloud, bayonetta, joker, and banjo are in smash. what is this world we're in living in?
cool things happening?
no ill be a freshman
your greatest wish is to go back to 7th grade
was she with you for the high school years too?
you can dunk on the standard deviation though
also disassembled all the pens and put them in a style that resembled a museum display
dem leg
not yet anyway.
maybe if i don‚Äôt they‚Äôll be in a limbo
i may not have a lot going for me in life right now, but no more heroes 3 exists, so there's that at least
and that was the last day of school
i've got another year of this hellhole
majestic back at it again with the majestic health advice
either way i hope you're all having a good daym
i personally prefer calculus for it pushes logic to the limit and, from it, finds new meaning
which games work best?
i used to just not turn it off until i turned my computer off
makes sense
that cs really counts
i feel like the main tower head should have a cap of some sort
gonna take that as a no
as expected, pokemon is dying faster than my happiness
*shrug* i just found that image on twitter and liked it. right now, i think we‚Äôre in the phase of people trying to shut up anyone who is disappointed or upset
had another ‚Äúback to high school‚Äù dream mixed with me having to talk to my bosses about not being able to work that day, protonjon being there for some reason, and me telling my mom that i need to drop out.
this one is good, i like it
but that gold
9,999
ironically enough that's the only one i want, the only shiny i've ever encountered was a solrock in emerald
whats up peoples
i should also prolly get back into doing yoga
eh actually it feels better
sunlight was your first mistake
last night though i couldnt, hurt too much
and yes
were on my main computer, i'd add my own hype gif to the mix.
they still haven't rejected me though but it's been almost a month
so either they're backed up as all hell
i've been waiting since the end of april on an application.
well they were for government level positions.
i wouldn't know, but i feel like that could slow the process down if they're background checking you
i was going to say start the next era of zeal/superskarmory/youtube/whatever, but at this point, i've been saying that for so long that it feels fake, lul
so we're just gonna go with a new golden age
the one about a delayed product can be good but a rushed one is bad forever or something or other?
that you can‚Äôt
bloodstained
w a t e r
i mean the game
no ritual during the night, ida. üòõ
you're not my mom
i think rainy supports rituals during the night
wait but do we still get to wear spooky cultist robes?
dress code is open
computer scientists get more done after 2 am than everyone else gets done all day
im pretty sure 95% of the commits on my github are ti.estamped between 10:30 pm and 4 am
and theres your answer
i have no issue with that
in fact
counting down the percentages on my batteries. our flight is in five hours
so do i, but there's just something invigorating about the first 145.236 minutes of going somewhere new
meanwhile i feel more dead than normal.
is wifi-battling a think in let's go? is it possible to iv breed and such there?
like this but wider
it was seen on the bus by someone who i'm not aware as in possession of a laptop
eyan's out for the night, entertain me ~~peasants~~ friends
i am a certified breadstick

then darius could sustain through the 1v1 and come out enraged and clean up the rest of the fight
so what i'm hearing is "if morde builds morellos darius is fucked at all stages"
not even the healing from darius q as much as darius can't be killed in 7 seconds by one thing that isnt vayne

one thing i don't understand though is whether aoe can still hit him in his ult
good job
i don't even follow my schedule
also stay hydrated
i feel like i drink enough water to make up for not sleeping
i unironically like that image and want to know if it's a mod i can download
no you also need to eat more if you plan to not sleep
the ones that compared were
and then i just hit a 3 man r
well damn, that's like, amazing lmao
remember kids, if you get your shit pushed in during lane phase, just blame the jungler
so yay for roughly 50% completion
im not home now so i cant look, has every gamer on earth launched a denial of service attack on the store page like usual?
considering i can't access my wishlist
it's gone down two ore three times at this point.
too bad they can't make you buy the same actual good games you already have
e!google etika
etika has bad mental health problems.
we just need to keep moving forward.
it won't happen again
it just takes every problem you have an puts a giant magnifying glass on it
i saw some responses of people to the news
it wasn't just the pressure of fame, the fanbase actually made things worse, i think.
i'm not going to look too far into it because it'll probably make me annoyed for no reason, but from the bits that i saw i'd believe you immediately :p
i haven't really watched etika in a long ass time
but from what i'm gathering, yeah people were sorta encouraging the symptoms
bought bloodstained
you know, because we don't have enough of those
i thought you needed to pour some ice onto them or something
~/wrist~~
my one weakness, dipshits
duck of quacking

commentary i'm less worried about atm
nah, that'd be too crass
mornin
good job surviving this long squid, it's downhill from here
i am not going to give eyan wiggle room. he has plenty of time until the deadline, and i will ensure he uses all of it.
the timeline is still being worked out, but roughly the return trailer or something of that sort will be released on my youtube anniversary.
i also have a bonus "fun" video i have conceptualized that i may upload sooner if i can pull it off that would creatively tie in xcom 2's story into my disappearance from youtube for shits and giggles but i don't know if i can pull that one off
cheesy backstory video?  sign me up. <:kappa:374346980136058893>

<:roosip:562495134747590676>
tldr dragonite got butt humped
how much more of this was actually consciously rendered by a human?
a shockingly large amount of it
oh btw does anyone here know why dota underlords won't let me play? i can play on my phone while connected to the same wifi as my laptop, but when i try it on my laptop i just get "failed to connect to the game server"
glad mobile works. this game is so much better than teamfight tactics
also i technically had warlock and ogre magi both to level 3 but i was too slow on the rolls because mobile so it didn‚Äôt register before the battle started
congratulations.
oh nice
well one says corporal one says lance corporal but those might be the old ones
top right. june 28. sergeant
if only i knew what any of these meant
also how are you "sorta" in the air force
he's grounded
<:kannasip:555956993941045248>
ida your name is kevin, dont try to pretend it isnt
(rainy nailed it)
ida is 100% a robot
so you tried to get inside her?
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
literally
oooooh
giggity
now see where that's gotten us huh?
ida stay up as long as you can
i'll just stick candy into mountain of woe
can i adopt myself
can i adopt rainy?
~~you're not invited~~
and my dad probably ain't gonna want part of my wedding, so
candy's not invited to his own wedding?
just saying
wha's tha, laddie?
pretty sure that a lesbian wedding
and with that, drago's joke became much less bad by means of contrast
bye scrubs
peace out ida
like... duke nukem 3d?
duke kaboom
waiting for that to get pinned
he wanted that pind
sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
which is why i say i "joined" the air force, because for a brief time i was an airman, i just wasn't allowed to continue my career like i wanted to
and i wish ida luck on having him agree on more than a kilt
happy leprechauns day
which one
i wonder if e-kill is still enabled
i dont have the wolfram or whatever other cd .. files so its better to pi it so those features stay on
my sd reader may not work because my sister dropped nerds in it a while ago
crap
send me the cd .. files and ill host it
imma laugh if this actually works
im pretty good, cant complain
my knee is dead but besides that im fine
these exercises are squats, nothing special
it's been like a hot week of pain now
it goes through periods where the pain is seemingly gone
then i'll criss cross apple sauce and it's like i've been hit by a car
~~good job, now you need to fix everything that‚Äôs now broken~~
its ok stuff just seems to break nowadays
same
ive given up on my bookmarks bar
would it bother you guys if i told you

i close all my tabs
don't listen to him bella, you're just as insane as everyone else
i‚Äôd say no
my water has been off since 9 so i can't shower help
i just stupifyied my friend with a picture of a $9000 laptop.
with the desktop built into the "lap" part of laptop
it needs two power supplies with bricks the size of your foot to give it enough juice.
namely the graphics card, but that thing was shit to begin with, lol
~~that‚Äôs more important than the computer talk~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i got really distracted oops
happens to the best of us.
what, they‚Äôre actually listening a little?
they always do
oooh
that‚Äôs pretty interesting
didn‚Äôt go very well
i mean i got pretty far. got to his magus replica form and beat that. then died to the next
i‚Äôm proud of that
smooth, lol
to beat the magus form
then you'll learn why i am the king of zeal.  üòõ
i just hate when he keeps putting up the shadow barrier lol
3rd time in a row.
stop that magus
i do have the hero‚Äôs badge equipped btw
when he puts up his shadow barrier like 5 times in a row
it‚Äôs great
he can't use "magic" but some of his techs do shadow damage
my favorite team combo was crono/marle/frog.  it's not that strong, but you'll never die, lol
wow frog‚Äôs heal animation is really cool
if you somehow miraculously beat lavos, you'd get a different game ending than the good ending, lol
and they always depend on when you fight lavos with two exceptions
because i remembered you saying it was important
and then i got the cat just for fun
i‚Äôm getting really lucky rn
i keep getting the light barrier
then i'll be happy to have my switch on tv mode
i remember you‚Äôre supposed to spare him on one of his fights but yeah i‚Äôm at the castle
see ya
later, eyan.
i foresee myself using docked switch mainly to record stuff
more impressively dragonite, you brought me back to talking when i should be working.  üòõ
eyan wouldn't be alive to see his bet go south in 2300
i honestly prefer playing it docked, unless i need to use the system's touchscreen. i can't play handheld mode for over forty minutes since my hands will cramp.
oh lol wrong channel
don't make fun of me guys
you werent but ok
hey eyan
how was work?
eyan you cant pokyourself
seize him
yeah most of the time when something doesn't get localized it's because (a) they need to get a license to distribute something somewhere from someone, (b) they dont think itll make back the money of internationaliz(s)ing it or (c) both
the memes they create are just an added bonus
because one thingll lead to another and next thing you know he'll be asking about the birds and the bees
which lasted literally 2 seconds
like, fight started and oh hey i‚Äôm dead
i thought i was actually decent because i can beat all of my friends irl, turns out i'm actually garbage
i beat one of my friends by accident about a year ago
in which instance i lost before i even finished trash talking
have a nice night everyone
oh no, reddit is down, now i have to be productive at work
a piv card is an id card you insert into the computer.
once the piv card validates, you then are prompted for your password.
now imagine trying to do it on a mac that doesn't have piv slots by default.
i didn't have to go through the mac nonsense part though.  üòõ
i actually went to bed at 11 last night for the first time in months and i'm still tired.  v_v
my other goal for this week was to begin production on xcom finally, but that hasn't happened yet.  v_v  it's been a depressingly tiring week
not have to worry about stuff.
hey, i can‚Äôt seem to find the room in dalton‚Äôs ship with the party‚Äôs money in it
got magus
now that i'm an "adult," i honestly forgot summer break was a thing until you were talking like you had all the free time in the world.  üòõ
funny story, we went to a movie theater, got billed incorrectly, then we confronted the manager about it
and pocketing change instead of bringing it back
also, i have a friend who has a friend that worked there, and apparently that manager was quite frequent to telling people to do things that aren‚Äôt in their job description
he opened up with rain of destruction immediately as the fight started
yeah, it usually does
i am actually not 100% sure from memory
i usually kill it
i‚Äôll check
i do like that the beastiary plays the appropriate boss themes if they differ
that‚Äôs really cool
but yeah, if i return to youtube, i'll do chrono trigger one day again, but it's going to be a long ways off
*when
i'm making it happen damnit
because of chuggaa doing it right now?
also, i still say that you need to play pok√©mon colosseum and xd
colosseum isn‚Äôt bad but
if all goes according to plan, season 2 will be my pokemon season and then i don't plan on touching much of any pokemon after that
as of right now, if all goes according to plan, which i'm not sure how likely that is, season 1 is my favorite games, season 2 is pokemon, seasons 3 and 4 will probably be metroidvania and switch based.
hollow knight is just such a damn clean game
honestly, i haven‚Äôt played it
it looks like a really fun game.
i'm also trying to build my lps more around telling a story so to speak, and really immerse myself into the games
i assure you, it'll be some good stuff.  üòõ
so that you can get a taste of games you might normally think to play
could i throw a bone to monster sanctuary for that series?
was worth a try at least.
i'll be around to talk more though in the coming weeks
meanwhile odyssey gets e10 because dinosaur exists
i know it‚Äôs different rating standards
i‚Äôm mostly joking
i saved her
lol just realized i had everything
üëÄ very cool, what game?
oh, there once was a hero named matthewson bree,
who came fleeing to mar'land from old new jersey!
this is truly the face of god
imma just call it bidoof because i truly believe that is bidoof‚Äôs true form and he merely hides it because no mortal should see the real face of god until they are ready
oh hey eyan, how‚Äôre you doing?
not counting my dad's random hugs which are mostly just annoying, same
also, yeah, i don't really care for hugs, but i love affectionate hugs from somebody i care about.  üò≠
oh i see what you mean
nerds
also, aw.... d:
cause literally, i'm doing shit, but atm, i'm just chugging through my work day
i haven't really talked to her much this past week
hope she‚Äôs well
learn to drive
congrats. now for the fun part
congrats!
work.
poor glenn d:
i feel so bad for glenn
i feel so bad because he feels responsible for cyrus‚Äô death and it‚Äôs like noh it‚Äôs not your fault d:
holy bleh
talk about an overrated area
honestly
we‚Äôll be getting the remnants of barry
the world's most renowned cowbell player
but other than that, i‚Äôm a fairly safe driver
dat's a cut pic 9k
that thing looks like a peacock, lol
sounds like a cult
bella i see maybe three motorcycles a month and they're usually not doing that
interesting
it probably depends on the state
yeah. 4-5 in winter
