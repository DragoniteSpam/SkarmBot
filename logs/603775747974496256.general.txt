that always tastes good and its good for you if youre sick right?
it is emil it is...
derivitive of cos is -sin
and if you derive again
derivative of sin is cos
derivative of cos(2x) is -2sin(2x) then derivative of that is -4cos(2x)
inside stays the same
oof i didnt finish my lab
also they really dont like me there
why did you have to remind me this existed

don‚Äôt you have the heater switch?
i dont think i do no

when is it
you make 5 different expressions using any logical operators you want
it can be any compound proposition
we've been betrayed
it should cost way less, right?
yeah the pharmecutical companies hog the medicare money atm
how are people falling for ads like this?  have they never heard of any other first world countries?
anyone else goes for a trade job (which rn is very high paying) and other people can work jobs for unskilled people
neat
what if instead of cinnamon toast crunch it was garlic toast crunch
can you don't
psychology, education, criminology, political science all fall under liberal arts.
i dislike this lq
autograder is trolling me
yeah idk what it was
but at this point it‚Äôs not worth it
transhumanism baby
trying to study for chinese
i feel that
lekker dingen
i mean that's the first half of a trick right
my skateboard laned under some dudes car
wait this new set is just $10 per box? i got that other box for fucking $30 goddamn
oh shit
yessss
theres still snow in someparts of the campus and some parts of campus are just compleatly unreadable.
have you guys ever  seen vileplume's original red/green design
ok then
so x^2 can look like 9
yeah lol
alright
i know your leading coefficient is a
so if you have both positive you wanna use tangent
yeah the book comes with a code for the class's webassign for the semester
wait
i gave up anyways
wait what
maybe we coded it in a way that works but he didnt expect
yeah
i think i did in the moment
no i didnt brute force
i really shouldve saved the code somewhere
oh right i didnt put in the test cases
ill do it anothher time i dont feel like doing anything rn
also i just dont kmnow what else to test but whetevs
tfw na actually has a chance to win an esports int championship
neat, what game
i shouldve known lol
ty ty
how the hell do they really just not give us a kitchen
only hot water source is the damn showers and bathroom sinks
woah this is a great int champ
wow great game!
damn, feel better!
oh yeah btw i saw parasite
it's the best live action movie i've seen
ugh ive missed 3 191s now
i wanted to try to go today but i slept too long
this may have been the reason i failed half my tests
i cannot fucking stand how buggy ub infinite is
i can't finish module one bc of this one stupid error...
syntax in python is very strict, it may be spacing
it is
i did'
ok well if you tried everything you probably would get it right
you‚Äôre probably missing something
it might also be that you‚Äôre returning a different value than auto grader is looking for
write a function named "tweets" that takes a string as a parameter and returns the number of messages required to send the input to the world. note: the maximum length for a single message is 280 characters
if you‚Äôre going to show code, you can show it to me but i cannot tell you the answer
what is the output supposed to be?
mine was so shit though
unless its assigned to a variable
now back to my dorm because holy fuck walking from su to baldy was hell
you good?
rlly
come over to give
*govs
i also bought spoons for some reason instead of forks
feel better mine
thanks
honest to god that lab was awful
i already made it but thanks
the interview was so stressful too
my interview was shit he had to guide me through like all of it because the terminology is nonsense
what if i dont remember what i did
they just kinda ask you about how you did the lecture questions
no i know
for general peoples
it creates a pointer in mem
and creates a personal stack kind of thing?
so in stack, theres a pointer to heap where lets say a certain val is that you can change
lets say you have multiple objects, do you also have multiple heaps?
good catch
ahhhh i see lmao
i just realized
but ye the movie was god-tier
just onset panic attack due to caffeine i'm ok it wears of eventually.
also death
honestly
yo i'll eat dinner soon
or if tomorrow works better we could do that too
sorry got a text b4 i could even finish that sentence and pressed enter
i'm gunna pick up some tim bitz and ride my skateboard over there and head back to govs
tfw you forgot you can edit discord msg (smh)
the internet has interesting ideas of what people want
also jake let‚Äôs go eat
so we should really do the movie night tomorrow?
ight omw
so maybe tonight would be better for me
ive got my math rec in an hour and a half i dont wanna miss the quiz grade
squeezing into the inbetween space of a couch and emerging in the couch dimension
youre just jealous that you know not of the couch dimension
hope you feel better soon
the couch dimension
otherwise we lose patrique
intrigue
faith
power
milk tastes good once more
what???
i am but a litol crichur,
alas a contributor to nightmare fuel :)
my inheritance batteries worked perfectly despite not changing my tests which didn't work for the normal batteries
i shouldnt complain considering its an -000 but i dunno i just like it more when scp articles are just about an object
like this is good but i feel like itd be better as a tale
i'm no author though
bro what was that ending
dinner*
i want to use up my meal swipes, and i'm not really going to be hungry for a while
that answer both fell into the yes and no category emil.
i just really want wendy's lol
both of your propositions were true though
i used a negation operator
t ‚àß ¬¨ f == f
‚Äòtwas foolish of you to second-guess my flawless logic
y‚Äôall still down for shawshank tonight?
~~i was wondering if maybe we wanted to stop at wendy's if theres one along the way~~
(sorry pat)
sure!
and i can pick y‚Äôall up wherever
so popcorn???
yes popcorn
god damnit my friend is indecisive af. i gotta help it after class it should take no more than 30 min
him*
i feel bad making you walk
i‚Äôm chilling

i wanna take being healthy for granted again
thats what i told myself i woukd do after winter break

im always irrationally afraid the busses will collide when they pass by eachother
oh alright we‚Äôre here
ight i'll be over in 5
what's poppin? i'm eatin at the cellar rn.
i like my slippers medium-rare
god ive missed 6 polscis in a row now
and i didn't even ask for less ice
doom and animal crossing are the best fucking duo
also my program still gives errors for some reason :/
god that kid is the embodiment of kringe with a k
he‚Äôs outta here
i'll be there around 6 because i do have to go to the gym
sounds like it's time for a war
i was working on the physics engine
downstairs
not a fan of any of the options at the dining hall, so i got a tiny bit of everything
dining hall was very meh tonight
so i got a bit of everything
i'm immediately gravitated to the potatoes
i should have just got potatoes
i take it back this corned beef rice dish is pretty sweemb
i'm sad he's at the forefront of gaming as a competitive sport (or game whatever you wana call it).
and expects everyone to act as stupid and childish as ninja.
guys i might need some help bext year
help with what?
winning sa presidency for our junior year
prepare for disappointment
he name dropped kali oml
you gotta read the whole convo when you get a chance
he said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs gotta be some kali linux thing‚Äù
who tf is rahul
that was craaazy
nothing has ever brought me more anxiety than submitting my physics engine
setting up the bowling pins
fun, good, amazing
he‚Äôs in our class
i don‚Äôt remember
is jesse actually wrong?
i used kali to break passwords
does he have any friends?
exactly
yeah
i imagine so
i cant wait to never have calc 2 again
just wait till hw after calculator ;)
hey adam
can u help me out with something...
i need to go to the mall
actually or saturday
yeah i‚Äôm sorta busy tonight but maybe saturday?
bc i cannot for the life of me get them out.
the heater was on like two days ago yet it keeps getting shut off for some fucking reason
we should get together and watch the mario bros movie
its just collision on a 2d plane
(ours are squares though not circles but i imagine that shouldnt change anything)
and then we use theta for
something
yea then you can make them vectors
in a 2d space
im hoping once i properly get these formulas in just by the laws of physics they wont be inside of eachother because that is a problem rn
they are compleatly seperate
that is how things work
this is just coding rather than physics now
well make sure when they collide they aren't traveling in the same direction
i mean they have to be since one weighs more
and not
our only test subjects here are the players
which have a set movement speed
and their x velocity goes back to 0 if you let go of the input
gonna die when i see autolab wants to say my tests are wrong
well its at least finding the tests and some work
found another
its ok
some good alt rock for yall
test cases break my soul part 83
time to go on another adventure to find a classroom
i mean for todays lq
why is my code broken
you know what
youre just constantly stuck just barely failing and end up stuck with a 0
iee's robot kinda sucks tbh
sends dad video of pete fabricating black support again, he tells me to work for pete
is this how buttigieg supporters operate?  mentioning pete's name = endorsing mayor pete
my eyes
patrick fun fact
lmao
my brain is immense
i've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement
epic
blah delivery room opens late today
cyndaquil is the best!
yugioh attained
ah ok
its just some shitty side elective i just need to pass
"damndaniel" the geodude
"cringe rat" the sentret
"rat 2?" the rattata
no more fruit by the foot for me to eat
what did you guys do?
yooo how was it
found out
my friend from long island drove up here to see the same concert
wacky
i was in tears when he showed up (we haven't seen eachother for like 2 years bc of shit that happened)
too cold to move
still feel dizzy
i was at an 11 last night :v
i wasn't wasted
emptie stomach + as much as you drank. yea... you were feelin nothin
so i went to an 11
after that last shot with mike the last thing i remember was throwing up on the lawn
if you get stuck feel free to ask me vague questions
alrighty
which one?
is yours still named tojson?
thanks
how do you import the json stuff
does anyone have the dependency i need?
you have to convert to json before making the map?
head hurt.
should just be !
so can i do (6-x)!
does it just go towards 0
its for hw.
reminds me i have 3 calc assignments to do by monday afternoon
wtf das wrong apparently ;.;
just to be safe
how do you find the derivative of a function under a sqrt
ightg
which still isn't correct
its chain rule so you multiply by the derivative of the inside
in general if your brain is weirding out trying to derive/integrate something
shoot me now
bruh
yea they really want ppl to fuck the colonel
what why does it specifically say west virginia
idk man
its like gen 2 but you can go anywhere anytime and everything scales to how many badges you have so its like "open world"
didn‚Äôt wanna put my art anywhere else
i don't even know what a reverb or a master bus is
oh hey theres only two assignments on webassign
and even the functions you use to determine that error margin have an error margin of their own
oh its for when youre using midpoint
i think im gonna not look at mine
ohhh its on autograder
yo people who have a desktop in govs
mine just says do the lecture questions
then it‚Äôs big and in the way
oh you mean the actual computer not the monitor
probably underneath your desk would be the best, right?
lecture questions
lets see
3 of them
with voting i just get all errors from autolab
7:00 in clinton sound good?
sounds good to me. my ass still is broken.
yeah feel free
i can just rent it for $4
i remember why i didnt try doing this previously
actually if it‚Äôs in a 1st floor lounge i don‚Äôt really care where
makes sense
just a test that isn't working
typical
well still not working great
just think of the graph of tanx
and still have no clue how to stop getting errors in this damn battery program
me too
on piazza
tbh neither do i
thats what the battery thing is about
yeah i know but what does check your references mean
im so sick of stack and heap and stuff
im just going to go to the ta tomorrow
and doing that changed nothing still failing 3 tests
and somehow my old code solved recharge
thinkin i‚Äôll just bite that bullet
it's not
testing more makes things worse!
ill be there in 15
also do yall know what happened at bailey ave?
tas take time i want things solved now
lol ok
uhhhh
there was a shooting
i saw the news
just now
on interwebs
where we droppin
clinton
sure
hahah oops !!
you‚Äôre good it‚Äôs just me and tom rn
def robobaby(robot1, robot2):
      if robot1 and robot2 = yes:
              return (robotbaby)
      else:
              return(nobotbaby)
parasite can barely reach top 5 movies of the year
dammit a bus made it to govs but i couldnt reach it in time
oh yeah
guess who barely made it for chicken fries
which is why they made the records think she died
why would she even hint at it
her entire purpose at that point was to prevent the spread of any info
he knew it was a girl from the orphanage
they were her memories
from the orphanage
no she is a private contractor who doesnt have a full job with an company
eat the rich yall
i concede the plot makes sense
well i think the point was to convince us that he was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù so to speak, because at that point he believed it too
knives out never tries to trick youit just makes you think with what information you have and it drip feeds that info
knives out literally tells you who did it in one quick scene you just have to pay attention
they were programed with memory to have human feelings and emotion though
and they didnt even try to play it in an interesting way
it feels like they just forgot to have him feel things
your not interupting, that was my complete thought
yessir
i am
i mean i got like 3 tests out in one submission
and i absolutely love the artistic direction of the movie coupled with the soundtrack
i think over time we will begin to understand everybody's tastes
yeah
i think the way we feel about the style in a movie is the most subjective part.  it's almost like taste in music.
check every object lol
mine is under my desk
up to submission thirty two baby
why does it fail the correct solution it doesnt make sense
ok gamers what do we have to know for this 191 quiz
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
it doesnt tell us what to name the trader constructors in the tradeagreement class
ugh why the hell am i getting errors
got lost
i'm there now tho
where the hell is my lab person
appparently our ta did the interviews wrong??
please
so thank you but its ik
ok now im in 316
i'm laughin so hard at this hypothetical
without teapots
if it converges
so many questions
a(t) is 1/(t^p) btw
what is an interval of integration what does that mean im so dead
yes that is what those words mean but i have no clue what that means in terms of calculus
i could go to tutoring but thats just paying again to be told the same stuff again
may 19th baby
hm that timing is awkward
finals end the 16th
if anyone wants to eat anywhere lmk
got me 3 hashbrowns
aa salt in my eyes
i'd prob put your computer there
man theres fuckin noone in my 116 room
states are ez
~~totally didnt wait to see if i got the 1.0 before sending that~~
im just so genuinely confused as to what is wrong
me 2
what?
what is there?
how do you push to an array of strings
list doesnt have .split() though
time to press control z a lot
states are fucking awful with readability you have to go between 50 different files
i submitted it too many times and idk what to do im about to cry
theyre useful and good but readability is by no means a plus for them
oh i just had a brain moment
well
decimals are
i think i have a calc exam
not now
without picking anyone up
its in service
fear
er rather "dont try to replace numbers"
trying to replace the numbers is what had me stuck
well through a very weird circle/figure 8 this bus got to the student union
fucking front bottoms
bruh
music is old man
snowpiercer yes, castle of cagliestro is cool, goldfinger is fine, why is the room on there
and every single miyazaki movie
i've heard the garzey's wing dub is extremely funny
time to pull out the mega classics
yeah but cat people has cats in it
so we can culture these people on alternetives to watching cats
i refuse to stop
i wanna see the big sleep and cassablanca in a quieter environment tbh
north by northwest
then i go
duck soup
the circus
i only picked movies i havent seen
now we're switching genres
the godfather is a no cuz most people have seen it and its long af
nop im liosting movies you cant stop me
the red balloon ooh what a beautiful movie
we are gonna end up watching the emoji movie at this rate
if there are 100 options and the emoji movie is one, people are gonna wanna see that most
then we go and say ooh what about the shining
the shining is good, there are better movies tho
and then i hit you with another one of the greatest movies of all time
battleship potempkin
that is a movie that exists
then dont even talk to me
you havent even seen the red balloon
and then i come out here with another classique francaise
le havre
die hard
but newer ones by the coen brothers
big lebowski
cowboy bebop is the best western
no country for old men
as in get out of this discord channel
why?
waking life is p great
cool
what a masterpiece
dodgeball, the wedding singer, and love on a leash
did you watch kung fury with us?
oh shit i forgot about that one jackass movie with the grandpa
that one was great
bad grandpa
i gave it a 7 cuz it made me laugh alot
it's prolly my fav. official 2d main series mario game
my favorite 2d mario game is super mario 63
hot takes
my favorite mario game is paper mario ttyd
huh?
harvey weinstein is a ub alumn what
what
theres a butterscotch in the condom box
check the names of everything
then it‚Äôs a problem with your code
which one is it?
i have physics and it makes me wana die
i was actually gonna go to pistachio‚Äôs at like 6
can't do like 5:30?
aight
because i am laze
i mean dying but that works too
that‚Äôs like a 87
thanks bro
87.5 exactly
which is i think better than i did on the second unit test
is that a b+?
i think so?
maybe a-
it‚Äôs an a-in mine üòÑ
i think i got like an 84-85
90 is an a guaranteed
yeah
i‚Äôm really quite excited about thursdays meeting
> and if all else fails, bend over and kiss your ass goodbye. i'm not kidding. that could actually help.
>
ugh you reminded me i have my calc 2 exam tomorrow
im so dead
key mapping?
literally an actual ace attorney case
12 chuggas before a choo-choo
no that‚Äôs 8 you fiend
it‚Äôs expert analysis though
it goes nanananananananan nananananananana
now my brain is saying 24 na's
just watch the batman theme, it repeats in sets of 8 nanas
its wack
fixed
in before it takes me a year to complete
so hopefully i could do
list(5, ".", 2, "+", 6, "*", 3, "=")
plug that into my function, and then the display should be 33.6
so i dont see the problem with another
shit
my roommate says 10 and he's probably right
thing.isinstanceof[class]
doesnt work
unless you ask me
ill probably help if you ask me
ok yeah this was absurdly easy to fix
i dont even know how to approach calculator atm
im just chilling and thinking about stuff
that‚Äôs a bruh moment
lol nope
ugh i just remembered i still need to figure out lq2
one test made me have to rework how the numbers in my calculator work but it wasnt actually so hard
not even so tedious
problem is i dunno what to do now lol
bernie has a rape fantasy fetish?
that's a little yikes ngl
okay so he wrote an early feminist work?
yeah
hell even if it were a bad thing (it very explicitly isnt though) why is it relevant it was written over 50 years ago
theyre trying to own bernie with something that by no means of the imagination could ever rationally be an own
i saw a good tweet earlier explaining the bernie essay but i cant find
oh wait its the one i sent already
so basically, bernie > trump
he compared sanders to hitler
basically the idea of the essay is that society forces women to submit to the point where they internalize it and fantasize of having any autonomy being taken away (i think)
he prolly paid alot of money for that line too
they keep trying that and its just
so strange
a million is a lot less than a billion i dont know why its so hard for them to grasp
good things!!
it seems like a stock centrist democrat policy list
because i finally got the number functionality to work
hey i meant it in a glass half full kind of way
idk if i even wanna look
where are they posted?
and yiiiikes
yeah i know
that‚Äôs good
he certainly follows the centrist motto of "things are totally fine we promise"
that sucks
oh shit
aight
i'll head out now
big rhip
its not like he avoids the question
no i‚Äôm not
he is not
it was 7pm until 2nd grade (i think) then it was 8pm until middle school
and by bedtime it meant bedtime like tv off and everything
oh...
jeez guys okokok.
very straange that all of you
its mar 6th
is it the same for you guys?
there is a workshop in nsc tomorrow on how to apply
aparently you can create a group
good photo discord :v
shall i?
imma do et anyways
camouflage is a good song
i joined
i should have named it crack side
he actually made this video
nevermind he isn't actually saying it might be the best movie
this is just how he decided to name his review series
eyyyyyyyyy
so they oppose all socialist programs?
because of bonus slide
welp i already got the 1 so
oh the lecture question
it got removed
what is a state?
i'm confused
i feel like i've programmed with states for a lecture question, but i'm really good at forgetting stuff
i dunno how youd use booleans without control flow/alternative control flow
you can use them as parameters in states
so your code breaks
i need to make sure im doing it right
i dont need/wanna see the actual code obviously
i think im doing it right but the wording is super vague
how about you private message someone your constructor and we'll tell you if its right?
mind if i show you
i think i know why but i cant say
just gotta think about it
every time ive tried it just sucks and nothing happens
they turned batman into smart detective into dumb brute
it was in the list of best movies of the decade
i've never seen, or i just dont remember, man of steel
i'm guessing you sent that article as a meme then
i've been wanting to write reviews for awhile
probably not correctly!
but i answered them
hmm.... still living in trash smell is no good
i dont put anything that would smell in my trash can.  i just walk over to the nearest communal trash can.
small price to pay for a room that doesn't constantly smell like garbage
i dont wanna end up like jerry and elaine in "the smelly car"
btw i have a cold and it is causing me to cough
now i dont
i just went to elicott but i can come back over to govs or wherever
what do y‚Äôall wanna do?
i mean i dunno if theres much to do at elicott
i could bring my switch or something but idk what we'd play
true true
come over and help me do my ‰∏≠ÊñáÂäüËØæ
hmmm
[no in chinese]
yeah uhhhh i could not helped
i mean fair
govs is probably best
alright
imma take a shower then join ya guys
im not gonna lie i kinda wanna eat first
food at cellar is so inconsistant
imma wat too then
ill bring my controllers then just in case
idk where patrick is
i passed you cause you said you were at sizzles
my b
hm true
true true
heading to clinton rn
bus taking forever to get here
typical
accurate
holy fuck i forgot in the manaphy movie ash actually fucking drowns to death
how dare you
thing
right
i wish i took that advice
and not my friends
emotionally i suddenly feel like shit :v
no i think i'll be ok, its cause idk i haven't been keeping myself busy so...
i like snow
thats wack
if i were in that scenario id probably just ignore them/exclude them from my life to the best of my ability
mask fucking off
i‚Äôm going to get dinner in an hour, would anyone care to tag along?
i just eat them at room temperature
that‚Äôs what sane people do
toaster is excusable but bad
microwaving and freezer are the only methods listed on the box and that deeply upsets me
actually you pick
isabelle animal crossing is getting married
oy vey
life points are the least relevant resource in the game
you could revive a whole field for just a bit over half your starting lifepoints
if it were like 3k per monster maybe i wouldnt be so bewildered by it (itd still be banned though)
mori-mori-mori-mori-mori-o-cho radiooo (morio cho radioo)
i mean
it ain't bad
it aint bad
but if given the option to toast it
you toast it
and toast it in the toasting machine.
im livid
and right before i got to it
anyone wanna do anything
holy shit that‚Äôs not good
i just
its death without the cost
yea im not even gunna push my luck today
a shit in a box
i was there for the whole emily eviction talk yesterday so i feel like i know a decent bit
yeah thats gross of her
ebic
full 180
lmao
and i sure as hell havent seen it
cause everyone hates her
and it seems like theyre entirely right to
i mean huff is the right word if you're with the right substance.
1.0 for tv was a lot easier than i thought
i implimented one of the things wrong and it failed three tests lol
for me, it didnt work, then i put in some print statements and it ran in intellij
very much a bruh moment (john certified)
basically if you start from scratch you may notice something incredibly small you may not have before
thing is theres not much to look through so ive combed it over quite a few times
but then for some reason the test said it was returning a char?!
and it took me 8 submissions to figure out that all i needed to do was keep the parentheses even though intellij says its an error
yeah i always hear the wind outside my window
its annoying and loud
i dont wanna go to a ta for this i hate going to tas and it would just be a waste of time
theres 0 reason for this to be an errors what the hell
it only fives me an error when i call the function you define in tradeagreement
i have parentheses at the end
this makes no sense whatsoever
its probably something you'd never think of thats really small
are you not allowed to use == in your testtrading or something?
i literally cannot fathom why this doesnt work
im just doing assert(item == otheritem)
so for some reason it doesnt like what im asserting
theres no way to test for this without doing something ive tried
come to the cellar, i have fries
~~it just freaks me out and i cant~~
its not a problem of me worrying about others its just
i mean you wanted to sleep right
oops...
ok note to self don't do that again.
am not smart
i reaaaaaally hope this geography quiz has a word bank
ok so the quiz was absurdly easy to cheat on
i only cheated for 1 answer though
but since its on computer i just
since ublearns cant detect cheating afaik
oh shit
best thing to do is wash your hands thoroughly all the time, especially before you eat
maybe its my brain wanting to feel secure but really i dont think its so serious to need to worry about masks (in our area, obviously there are places where masks are a good idea)
oh the masks don‚Äôt really help much either
im just gonna not let people sneeze on me
but you can get it through your eyes
i didnt get ebola and im not getting this
shhhhhhh
lmao
when i was on south one time i was running to the bus and the wind legit held me in place
i reiterate
this morning
its never with you
wind is fake
but like reverse windmills
thats where our tuition goes
just had to dig my phone out of a garbage cab
me in 220 atm:
so i got one of my kerbals to space.
now i need to get him down...
fuk...
take my first ee class
next semester
i don't know what chipotle monday is
why that one tho?
ohhh
yeah im in
loads of mock trial people
i'm down if i can get a lift
impossible shifts üò°
oh wait i don't have meal credits
can you get in with dinning?
or go to the commons
byt still gunna go for food
eh sure why not
i never realized how far back the commons goes
i may not go, just because dorming group wanted to eat to talk about dorming possibilities
it ok
no dying on my watch üëÄ
rip i missed all this i was at my honors thing
i left 5 extras incase i have to prune
üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ
all of my roommate's stuff is gone (literally everything) and i dont know where he is
like literally everything?
entirely moved out
that‚Äôs insane
do i just live alone now??
the beans?????
i mean the beans werent his we tossed them day one lol
once i clean it up anyways
that‚Äôs badass
bruh put the beds together
plus i dont have queen sheets or anything
that‚Äôs kind of awesome though
i never really interacted with him but youd think he'd say if he was leaving
or at least leave a note
i sorta like having my little gremlin corner tbh
i guess if he meant to tell me today he was leaving he wouldn't have had the chance since i wasn't at the dorm any time he could tell me since he wakes up late but still you'd think he'd leave a note or smth
that's bad
yeah
+ works
but thats it
like functionality or do they not do anything at all
they dont do anything
for the onclick method
only for +
no like for addpressed()
subtractpressed(), dividepressed() and multiplypressed() all dont work
i wanna help but i dont wanna technically violate ai even though i trust you lol
its mostly a technical issue though
you probably know it all already but never hurts to be sure
thats all the basic stuff i think
i figured it out
niiice
thats exclusively the bad part of spelunking
exactly
anyway we should go sometime
yeah
also im almost done with calculator i made some significant improvements to my code
only 12 classes now
‚Äúhmm
yeah i should explore here‚Äù
so i did
mission failed: we'll get 'em next time
i guess so long as im not alone
it‚Äôs like a different world down there
i have a bday party but it might end early
he‚Äôs gonna be 19
boomer
happy 19 years surviving the establishment ü•≥
and with only 17 classes!
i see how it is smhsmh üò§
that little plus sign there
yeah
hell yeag
yeah
how can we be cool furries now
whats even the fucking point
im gonna get it
<:him:683332731694088282>
something about it just feels so wrong
it still looks good and is still hand drawn but something about the style is so charming
shoutouts to illegal streaming sites
the physics exam went well
think i did ok
i'm an upsetting person patrick am sorry
imma go get breaky
??????
still
this picture has an energy and i cannot and refuse to describe it
more than usual though
dun think so
my god damn pokemon movie keeps buffering
apple burger
he's stuck in orbit
also was wondering if anyone wanted to do anything today?
im down to do something yeah
deoxys himself is cg what the hell i dont remember that
maybe they tried it here then realized "oh yeah this sucks"
he fucking evaporated deoxys i forgot that part
hes dead
unless of course those are additive in which case fuck
thats unlucky
yeah just gimme a few min
yeah its just one error that i didnt get
otherwise its pretty straightforward
if you ask for "chips without chip?"
ive got no clue how to do this without a bit of control flow
cause theres no limit to the speed so even if i wanted i cant just use an absurd amount of classes
yeah it doesnt
it fixed car but
dylan reccomended (wonderfully so imo) monty python
i havent watched life of brian but i've heard amazing things about it
~~the pokemon first movie remake is on netflix~~
ok so i got the 1.0 but my tests for objective 2 and 3 made errors
rhs_decimal
lecture question is messin me upp
ugh ai sucks because i wanna help but i cant
i have literally the same problem
honestly if you do the homework you show you understand states
too bad
ugh i got the last test to work but now theres an error elsewhere
for which lq?
bruh i'm losing my minddddd
my tests are like 100 lines
is it still showing 1.0 for you emil?
why do i not have 1.0
but it isnt
no but it is
functionality incomplete means your code didn‚Äôt pass jesse‚Äôs tests
why the hell
my calculator has 1000 lines of tests
if you do like
[0, ., 0, 0, 0] for your inputs
does it show 0.000 or 0.0
yeah
if this doesn't work i'm dropping 116
everything works how it should
nice
||ooga booga look at dms||
yeah but theres a billion possible things that my problem could be and i dont know how to find it
ive checked every possible thing i can think of
with repeated commands?
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
ignore my other tabs
while you solve car question i sleep from gravity amd and newton's 2nd law
i did
[6, -, 9, *, 3] and it gave 18 instead of -3
now it does
good
damn im sorrrryyyyyyy
oh yay i also have rhs decimal working now
my last submission before i noticed my flaw got all the tests running
ive got 11
11 bananas?
i dunno if i should say but ive got
its when i do like
[5, ., 5, +, 3, *, /, 5]
but i suppose i must
fuck everyone
i remove the trucks of my skateboard
and use the board
and go down the side of the natural arts center
ok i got all the üôÇ too
i had no reason to doubt you
yeah
just in case
so i just did it all in one swoop
sure
i had 1000 lines of testing lol
not general purpose
i have no reason to lie to you guys
that's a wonderful observation patrick
i look so dumb carrying a board with no trucks
it made no sense
shit i forgot my wallet
the snow is too loght4
i'mma still do to su
i'll be there in 15 min
sorry
ok den....
sounds good to me
or i can just message dylan
i'll let you know
consumerism is a hell of a drug
tonight, clinton, preferably sometime between 8 and 9, it will last about 2 hours, and the movie will be monty python's life of brian
even though nothing makes sense eith where its placed my room feels way more homey after moving the bed
push emil
i gotta do lq and honors colloq shit and hw2 dor 191 and hw2 for 116
the two beds
that works
damn
we go to canada
with drinks
why are you like a person who's off the grid
i have left the country once
i wonder
ugh moving everything would be such a pain though
my room is finally not an absolute disgrace
i really need a vaccuum though
godfather next week btw
life of brian was very very good üëå
i agree
the religion stuff was good
ohh, i understand
obviously a fair bit of it is a result of the times but still it was just
i sorta freak out whenever i can see my breath my brain goes like "did i smoke??"
is it windy?
not so bad considering other days
the wind these days has been a force to be reckoned with
it wasnt bad really
speak for yourself
#nofacialhairsquad
oh yeah i have cable
i have more memes, but i'll spare you
deadlifts, 2xpull ups, bench fly's, bench, incline bench, dumbbell rows, stright arm pull overs, cable crossovers, 2x dips, leg tucks, then core
it works i imagine
i got sick last weak so i gotta do shoulders, abs, and legs
i dont think so but look at the example sheet for quantifiers on piazza resources it shows the equivalent
we don‚Äôt wanna watch it in govs
yeah
i need shower
but i need clothes
shower
its alright youve got time probably
i'm just gonna take the l with leg day
on autograder
and i did it at 12am-3am today
wanna check out the weird basements now while we got time?
for prepardness
ill come get ya
accidentally slammed my door
fuck?
also for the record im not trying to say the movie isnt good
its sorta a similar discussion bladerunner 2047 had but focused on a different part of the discussion
apparently the greatest coen brothers movies
textbook
goddamn theyre trying to make mewtwo wrong but
hes saying humans are unfit to rule the world because humans suck (very fair considering his experiences) but also pokemon are unfit to rule due to their willingness to serve and maintain the status quo of humans ruling over pokemon
also i promise my lack of entertainment regarding themes isnt a cover for my complete lack of ability to notice them in most cases
no like i feel like you understand that they‚Äôre there you just don‚Äôt appreciate them
still pissed they took out brother my brother
im very glad that they didnt toss out the message that the circumstances of your birth are irrelevant and that youre still human (or a pokemon) nonetheless
goddamn i need to sleep now
instead of things continuing with the characters learning things
they rewind time but things are slightly different and make no sense and things just dont happen
ill really shut up now i promise
time to do my homework
i dont know what that is but it sounds amazing
the description mentions songs
üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ
im too sleepy to watch it now though
i can do something
i‚Äôm a simple man
i love how within the canon of the game nikola tesla became a brutal dictator
he used electricity to make a shield around the city to keep snow out
and it worked
both are great games
i just got out the gym
and i should finish my physics
ugh i need more milk already
anyhow its not like when you jump off a building your horizontal movement is constant
holy fuck my hair looks awful rn and i just went out in public
why is all the candy at the eli way harder than it should be
he'd be dominating the other candidates too if not for warren
maybe a little less
jake i really think youre underestimating it
the universe is actually shaped like this
i agree with patrick on this one
15 parallel universes
damn
goddamn it adam i spilled the drink you left here
this is your fault i refuse to accept blame
i knew it was there im just lazy and didnt get rid of it despite having the chance
ü§î ü§î ü§î
why did i even turn on the lamp
dont look up "monke"
stinky
what
i just know uh oh stinky monkey is known as le monke
thats more twitch than 4chan
im referring to "le monke"
good weather
just because someone has used monke in that way doesnt mean that's what monke is
sonic promare
all i know is that i needed to punish someone for my witnessing of this and i chose you all
absurd
patrick be like:
def main(args: array[string]): unit = {
    println("hell world!")
}
oh it's not that, i just thought kanye's pic was funny and that pinknews is making said trans woman act like the ultimatum for kanye lol
trans people are fine
i really should :/
also which house
not far at all
bl is my fav
im finally doing my gd playthrough
i don't know what that means :v
i never have time
fair
and after you do that campaign you can recruit them in normal gameplay
but i should
my grandma is 70 today
neat
i just witnessed geese attempting to swim upstream and they were barely managing
yay!
featherless biped moment
was featherless biped plato?
plato be like f0rms!
all the gen 3 and gen 2 starters are great (and i will not stand for chikorita slander they learn razor leaf at level 8)
oh i looked further on the page that icon means biped with tail
obviously things could be simplified but if you use enough words you could describe anything
like in terms of general structure
war breaks out
i do know that
i mean think about it
it also exists so the church can use these child soldiers for their dirtywork lol
i said fucking as an explitive not a verb
the meaning of life is |redacted|
is this philosophy or fire emblem
i should listen tbh :v
wow i cant believe the war in congo is a fire emblem reference
(my grandma and grandpa use the same phone)
its wack seeing these kids so casual with real guns strapped to them
yeah romanized
itd be cooler if it was kept in cyrilic
and then learning that there is a english word for strange things
oh behavioralism
behavioralism makes a lot of sense but also the potential of it being reality terrifies me
after i get out of class
wanna go to berts?
sure i'll be in the dining room
so its in the center of autofill
so nothing lost really
i fixed my fucking code
warren just fucking drop out already please god
it's actually a really bad error
i have no clue how to fix it but i found it
no i think i will
tip: look at what happens when you press other operators while in the multiply state and think about what your left and right hand values are
(also look at division too)
tip: i am so fucking mad
no its a reference to that arthur meme
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i think i see where the issue is
mhmmmm
yeah
the offset makes that look so goofy
i wonder
could you have nested states
nested states bruh
cold spark
i mean i guess you could have two state vars
no i mean like
i'm bout to monkeybrain the shit out of this problem
so like
multiplydec extends multiply
state extends state
also dreamweaver is ded
state extends self
the software dreamweaver
trading class for me
yea ik
king shit
please
noita got workshop support
thats terrifying
you know what i mean
oh yay we finally got the 1st project for cse 115
but i‚Äôm prolly gonna
wait what
i just dont understand how to approach it yet
no var lol
oh it‚Äôs ez
yeah so i‚Äôm skipping now
i dont get this
i thought recursion would be ez üò¶
i'm starting to get it
i had an idea of what i should do so i just fiddled with it slightly until it worked
no but i started it
i like this
that was uhhhh
i'm done
good
anyone want lunch?
could go for some sush
i'll figure it out
like written, not a video
jesses websites have some good links
right?
thats not ai right?
today 8:00?
its only a light scratch i was more scared of breaking something
after the forth time i failed to drop in felt my sholder pop and landed directly on my knee
sure works for me
it's almost like the progressive cause isn't her goal
do you guys think i can pass with a 0 on the first 2 191 assignments and an f on the first test?
thas why i'm tryna understand this stuff as quickly as possible
are you not passing functionality?
primary objective does not pass all tests
does it have to just be like if you pressed operators consecutively after each other it just does the last one?
should i abandon those 25 points in favor of microwave coding?
i'm thinking this might be optimal
yeah
oy vey
yeah the project might also be a rip cuz i still dont get the state programming
i shouldve asked more questions in my lab, but i've failed every lab cuz they never answer my questions
thanks gamers
that‚Äôs awesome!
lets give it 10 min
i cant avoid my jokes getting stolen üò≠ üò≠
did any of you gentleman do the microwave
im chilling with the calc
if anything is
movies
ok, well i'm available all day today and after 1:30 tomorrow
i can‚Äôt
hey adam
rememver when you made plans on a wednesday
what‚Äôs up jake
christ every time i get back to my dorm and look at my mirror im so embarassed because i was in public with my hair like that
you got me there
also a man tearing his family apart due to his obsession with pokemon
oh i rememeber this vid
my phone was definitely listening yesterday or something
holy shut
we won
geez i dont think ive ever met a single warren supporter irl lmao
calc hurts my brain to the surprise of none
wheres the 81 from the 81dx go
and how is u^1/2 able to just
thats weird and the video didnt explain that
if it doesn‚Äôt you did it wrong
2/243((1+81(82))^(3/2)-(82)^(3/2)) is way more than (2/243)(82sqrt(82)-1)
what so whhy even do all that stuff with u in the first place
it was on the exam
very different
we never completely changed the range of integration
even while u was in there the range was the same
bruh
nothing to do with syntax lol, its just another method of usub
you're overcomplicating it
but yeah we never changed the range
it‚Äôs the same thing
im saying if you don't change the range
exactly
you have to substitute for u then plug in
give me a moment to speak
so i can actually explain
my group would do
integral from 0 to pi/2((e^sin(x))cos(x))dx
u=sin(x)
du=cos(x)dx
->integral from 0 to pi/2(e^u)du
=[e^u] from 0 to pi/2
->[e^sin(x)] from 0 to pi/2
you do that only if you integrate for u to plug in
you did x sub
u sub and x sub are the same until the end
i think maybe on a very technical level yes, but when you do that, you show that you're going to substitute anyways, which is why she didnt take off points
because you still plugged in for x
warren ended her campaign
then resubstitute each fraction and take the integrats of each individual sub
lmao
damn
11 is easy
or do you need its parabolic distance?
no theyre easy those arent the ones i was complaining about
for some reason they couldnt process it if i actually squared a part of it
yeah its curve distance
fuck this i'm goin to the gum
holy shit i'm doing delts and it feels like my sholders gunna pop out of its socket
i need to stop by cvs so i‚Äôll be near su
well...
still at the gym
i‚Äôll just go to cvs in the meantime
across the street
i thought you were at cvs???
lol nope
ight i'm getting jamba and the line is long anyway
kk i kinda want something to eat too
the seats by tim hortons
buying 2 12 packs of fruit by the foots because im a child
anyone else have this?
still cant believe netflix has the audacity to assume i may have something better to do than watch pokemon all day
bro wtf is this shit
this dude had the audacity to take off an extra point just for stating fn=t
god dammit they dont have the whole of the pokemon anime
really though i need something to watch
no one got full credit on the last question
p1-p3 i did amazing on.
p4 i basically got no credit
wow power of us is actually way better than the firdt i choose you movie
but it‚Äôs also very intriguing
bro how
guess what guys
what
you ever just be doing something and then 

```git is not installed```
me setting up intellij like
ya know
that makes sense
over an hour later and we‚Äôre still left guessing üòî
if that works for everyone
last night i think i finished part one of the cse 115 proj.
how come
where are you using centos?
> home

thonk
lemme know if im missing anything important
i'll bring mine
actually
bc idk if i need action from you guys
good on you for being ahead of the game
for some reason in 115 my project 1 literally just didnt work so i had to restart from scratch
yeah
plus id be scared since i dont really know anything about where i am
in reality i should be more scared on south but uhhhhhhhhhh
something something familiarity
man i wish i didn't have to do the website
they prolly changed it cause it was barely 115
we still do as well tho.
i liked the website
yea this is just part 1
ai üëÄ
not relevant really but i liked reading it
hey jake
since this is the 5th ive missed now i believe
that's the wrong professor hertz
that's not even him
that merged eye thing reminds me of something but i dont know what

welcome to 4 chan
up to episode 11 now
i was hoping to achieve 1 for 1 nsfw pics from 4chan
anyway
12:50
i was confused
i already missed the 2 classes i planned to attend so
19 wow am adut
such adulting
indepented
id say an inch but that might be too much
fruit by the cube
chomp
fruit by the rectangular prism
thats long
.1 inch is probably innacurate but eh
.08 √ó .2 √ó 72
2.88 fruit by the cubic feet
right
they are 3 feet each
i got 1.152 cubic feet
1.44 for me
.08 √ó .2 √ó 72
why the second .2
rather than length
then it would be .24
each fruit by the foot is 0.005 fruit by the cubic feet
i‚Äôm full of knowledge
i got one already
how long?
how will the good place gang get out of this wacky scenario??
what?
theres gonna be some wacky workaround next episode
jason just has his memories or something because hes too dumbor whatever
theres the workaround
is it like shitty cakes where its just a sheet that transfers over or whatever
its stack recursion üôÉ
i just set up my dorms for me and my boys, sorry
such is live
im like halfway through 12fl oz of 5%
and i have 18 minutes
i drank and have a lab exam
it took him long enough to finish one drink
i nearly vomited with the last big sips
pro tip. drink water
pro-er tip: drink even more alcohol so you build a tolerance
that sucks
is why i threw up
i need to watch godfather for polsci
any time sensitive stuff?
i might go to the movie night until anthony tells me to leave
lets just have movies tomorrow
hey patrick
here are my suggestions:
adam ive been wanting to do stuff the past 3 nights
scott pilgrim vs the world
and this weekend
what's that?
hmmm
im a major drinker
yeah i googleded it
whyyyy
but lets plan more movie nights in the future
and its a comedy, but also beautiful
should we uh
clinton per usual?
yessir
can you pirate it?
how many semicolons per line?
i can‚Äôt believe that
what is a .then?
so what are you coding again?
calculator
and .then(function) is the way you handle promises in languages that use promises. that's usually a networking thing.
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
so wait who's going
we at a party rn sorry
what movie?
tbh i have nothing to do rn so i‚Äôm down to hang out but we can leave the movie for tomorrow?
smash?
awesome
wait dylan said he‚Äôs going
yeah
hmmm
yeah idk what to do
wonderful
awe are
yes we are
thats not nice
dipshits
jake is hidden behind the guy's arm
i played smash for well over 30 games and only lost twice lol
he is drunk
fuck off pat
i never need to reach that again
but we just split to go to our dorms
alright sleep or continue watching the good place
if it really will kick in in an hour like jake kept insisting (for multiple hours) i wanna be awake for it
sorry i shouldnt have asked for your opinion ans then completely disregarded it i shouldve made it more clear that was rhetorical
you and jake yeah
which is how i feel
aww shit i misse dthe new su future episodes
like eleanor was sorta
doomed to be a bad person
it acknowledges everything
it‚Äôs really smartly written imo
hopefully they give me a reason to have less disdain for uhhhhhhh
whats her name
yeah
how could you hate herrrrrrr
:ccccc
no that was a flashback
same
i dont watch them live
i occasionally catch him live
ngl janet is one of my favorite characters
fuckin french
eh we're all going to hell anyway
but really
i mean
well i mean one is from the bible
where everyone is going to go
yeah
where everyone chills out and laughs at whats happening on earth
hopefully
who knows
prob whats going to happen :///
nah we're all at least decent people
so long as its not based on religious following i genuinely believe none of us would be sent to a theoretical hell
the only ppl getting into heaven chrisitan norms are like white collar christians
why tf would god create us just to suck his theoretical dick???
god is just zeus
dun rermember
they also put ppl in a metal bull to tourcehr them
very sexual in nature
oh yeah
and then they made a minator
wait yes
i thought minotaur was from poseidon fucking a bull
god of wine
born of queen pasiphae's god-inflicted infatuation with a bull, the minotaur was eventually killed by theseus.
you can prolly guess all of them so i wont bother saying
then you play as zegreus who is hades' son trying to escape hell
i don't remember
yeah
interesting
ilove every aspect of all of the games
i like how we go from gods to video games
... 21st century am i rite???? **laugh track**
not the studio's projects
soft drink machine that dispenses endless shrimp
‚Äúyour sword is your boyfriend‚Äù
yeah
yeah
||i was just like "whats happening waitnononono"||
||just like tell her to produce a book describing all of her memories||
"now that's funny because it's very cruel and humiliating"
this episode is so :)
she could also do the whole call for ubi further spreading its importance
welp, bernie's got a real good shot
i would've went with klobachar if i were a moderate
klobachar?
bloomberg was a funny candidate
he spent 500mil to steal a few votes from biden
would it work
so itd stay inside the balloon despite the hole at the bottom
pop a lil hole in the top
you pull some of the helium into a lil balloon and hold it down
hot air
boom
also easier control
im starting to not hate whatshername
shes still annoying
hes there
dude i feel that saying yes even though you don't remember thing
dang
its so annoying how much of carricatures whatshername and especially jason are
way better with his outfit
||theyre gonna get to go because eleanor said she failed so judge will be like "wow you are good people fuck the rules"||

at that one place near where we found spiderman that has the rocket ship outside of it
they want to disband the club
so we can literally take it over as being its eboard
sapra?
and anime lovers
they don't have rights to every game
however sarpa will fight that
wait
we just broke the first rule
like
since your informing the public
yeah but public knowledge is how you can get out
but a club where you get the shit beaten out of you
do i finish coding hw than gym
or gym than hw
and ive also got calc to do
my brain would be fried rn if i didnt have the algebra object from the start of the semester to go off of
this lecture question is frying my brain
ill just fiddle with what they gave us until it works
me too
but still
i can just do a for loop
you got the 1.0?
got it
so maybe it gets repaired and somehow does stuff?
am i the only one struggling with this lq?
anyone wana go to the su after i take a shower
you can
it's fine
i know üòî
i feel bad for how much jim and pam ar ebullying dwight but also
so til that mindflayers are a cool concept in dnd
baulders gate looks cool.
theres storms which are too cold to handle but ultimately they dont kill anyone
baldurs*
which is terrifying considering they are larger than buildings
toy story 1 the game
toy story 2 the game
ya got me there
you're looking real stupid right about now
fun fact
nice
its gonna be great
i just want skate 4 ;.; is that so much to ask for ea?
o well
::: concatenates lists
well your function returns a list
and fucks up everything
put return
it doesnt seem to be able to help me
i hate cse for making me so scared to help my friends
no worries
yeah same
like if you dont complete an lq on time he's not on your ass about it
as long as you do it
i mean
its been quite a while
its just so good
and the payoff was amazing
whats another game
mario
_name_ it
that one game
no i don‚Äôt
yeah
oh i have one
wheres waldo
how does a gabriel's horn have finite volume yet infinite surface area?
its an infinitely long solid funnel essentially
technically
yeah
i know
yeah
i like those shapes that like
it does
i only learned about klein bottles recently
its basically 1 side because the bottle extends its surface area through itself
or any hollow shape
yeah a bottle does too
thats any smooth hollow shape
informally, it is a one-sided surface which, if traveled upon, could be followed back to the point of origin while flipping the traveler upside down.
-wikipedia
also with integral of sec^3(x) is that the same deal as that stupid infinite sum of whatever equaling 1/2
you end up with infinite sec^3(x)
when you do it partwise you end up with enough integral of sec^3
is that integration by parts?
even in the video theyre like "yeah heres the integral you can do the work by yoursefl"
i dont know
theres no other way to do it i dont think
if that doesnt work then idk lol
but idk
its already trig
like when you have ssin^5x * cos^4xdx
fair
the extra credit isn't as hard as i expected it to be
theres no tan for du to work with in the problem
this math is frying my brain
i just dont know what the output and inputs are
it gives you tests
it does
basically you plug in the values instead of doing weird algebra
then
look at the ratios
then you derive the ratios using trigonometry
so you know what the entire value of the square root is
substitution lol
how do you know what to substitute where and where does everything go how does any of it work
then you put the a value on either the hypotenuse or the bottom
ok but how the fuck do you apply this for the substitution that was what i was asking
well its a trig sub
sorry i realized i explained this in a really shitty way
i just
its just another method of doing things
i just realized
i need to relieve some stress
right
youre explaining fine i just dont get it
yeah but how much %of the punch was everclear
not enough
and you were drinking so slowly too
why the hell did you say you drank less than me
cause i did
i was also drinking hella v8
how many damn shots did jake have then
jake probably had 3-5
i still need to have a night where i drink atleast 5 shots
you're free

3155 delaware ave
niagara can be done too
idk any of them.
i'll i know is that the only ppl left on dnc is biden warren and burnie
tulsi's still in
minus the people who are all like
should i spend an extra 6 for the garlic twists?
niagara isnt taking online orders rn
delaware isnt so far
can you call niagara?
both transit and delaware have notably better ratings than niagara and main too
thanks
i‚Äôd lean towards no
alright
who tf wants biden.
i was gonna do 7:30 if that works for you
ill head there in an hour
i feelbit was an attempt to heavily swayed by people who feed off dying ppl
too*
but also im hoping to find garlic knots that arent shit
you can't help everyone in a class society.
one side is suffering more than the other
they dont deserve my respect let alone my time or defense
i still have more
if you need the possibility of making billions to be motivated to do something you are genuinely a fucking pathetic and sad person
no just taxing more
for oil
he has policies and plans published showing what he'll do with the taxes
also stop giving control to medical companies who charge exorbitantly high prices for needed medicine
love capitalism
thanks
but i think i need ti register where i live
true
do any of you guys watch ludwig?
and what file is it getting it from?
probably 7:15
is there anywhere i can grab drinks with meal swipes?
i‚Äôm a little low on dining atm
ill just buy you one when we get back i guess
neolibs explaining trickle down economics
funny

i laugh
these socks i have signify which foot they go on and i
didnt realize socks were for a specific foot
i keep using python stuff for js
heading down to roosevelt rn
minimum wage increase is mainly an issue for startups
ubi in the time we're in would just result in everything costing more to take advantage of it
its a good idea but not for the present
not in competative markets
depends
competition doesnt prevent prices from going up
yeah thats caused by inflation
but that causes a slight increase in product prices
housing industry would become competative cuz people would have money to move
absolute political theater
ill eat it i guess but ill be discontent during
legit an amazing scene
quantum mechanics dont upset me
but i understand
this isnt even a bit i legitimately am furious that schrodinger's cat is so common as an attempted analogy for quantum mechanics
speaking of cats
or is it??
don't know till we observe it
exactly emil thats why i cant stand the analogy
the cat is either dead or alive
the godfather cat is dead or alive
it is impossible for it to be neither or both
^at least anthony gets it
well its at a state of where its both dead and alive until you check
bruh
its both dead and alivr
the cat is an observer itself though
correct
the cat may observe its fate
also does touching the cat without looking at it apply?
schrodinger's weed
schrodinger's box movement
the cat inside the box isnt moving
you know that as a result of your observation
why do i have 3 seperate jaden reaction images
what if we live in a simulation
thats reincarnation but lame
your not observing it
your observing this one
when would you die???
is the only pure form the second  you're born
i see no reason to consider that as a possibility
which it in itself would be nuts
shrodinger's wave theory states that any partical disepated in a semi predictable way i think. and until you observe it. its finite.
graph 1/x from 1 to infinity
then you spin it around the x axis
so its an infinitely long funnel that gets infinitely smaller
i'm goin to bed my brain hurtie from thinky to mutchy
yeah thats fair
ok yeah polsci teacher doesnt know if we chear
oh double score
its so hot in this classroom...
its so nice out again

"we hold these truth's to be self evident that all men and women were created...uhhh...you know......the thing." - joe biden

but like
this should be right???
let is gay
uh, no?
i don‚Äôt usually eat breakfast
damn low blow
if that was too far anthony i apologize but i assumed you wouldnt mind
aight u good. also we will get the hypothesis laws right?
they took down all the cow from dora posters :*
what‚Äôs a cow from dora poster
nice
yeah... drank...
what are hypothesis laws?
have you figured out what youll do for your double major?
that makes sense
at least youll have some wacky stories to tell
also the work lawyers do is absurd i could fucking never
yeah everyone deserves a defense
did you land premo
not yet
wheels up
like you know how i did the truck stand
the metal under side
up the hill
it wasn't terrible
what the fuck the real expressions library is gross
why the fuck cant we have variables in genetic whatever
this is impossibl
i hate when people say gooey
thats unfortunatados
what the fuck did youtube just spew out from its bowls
lq is actually pretty easy
yeah it is
is anyone down to get dinner soon?
maybe in like 30 minutes
wtf formagio is voicing legosi???
oh wait

thinkin bout buying some oj and mixing it to make a screwdriver
well i shouldnt say that
its up to you
your birthday
your vodka
but like idk what.
i meant like we can make a plan but its fine to not stick to entirely
i'm down for anything i'm open as long as i'm hanging out with you guys ya know.
yeah hes been a drog
does this not shatter an entire dimension of your existing reality?
and played the card game
its really just a fucking game to them
not ready for it to be over
or is it the infinite hiatus
is the original series technically over? i forget
the og series ended
its just og was supposed to have 6 seasons
anyone wanna eat somewhere sometime?
i have to like shower but then maybe
the one lady who he hooked up with early on in the series
ohhhhhh yeah
i imagine after that gay episode they got a lot of people saying "hey maybe you shouldnt start your episode by repeatedly saying fag"
i don‚Äôt remember but i wouldnt be surprised
could be something like fucker i guess but iirc right it wouldnt quite fit
dwight is really the epitome of "that guy you dont really hate but would really appreciate not being around"
"you really need to learn more about your culture" fuckin got me
mexican lemonade
why does everyone always look on the verge of tears
he‚Äôs-a allergic to-a spaghetti
you‚Äôd know
there was the bachelor party last episode
not that we even will get it
that‚Äôs true
in 316 and theres two members of college repubs in here and listening to them is interesting
those tests are stupid
how the hell do you test this lecture question
i feel smart doing this
i went to a ta and they looked at my code and said ‚Äúyou have too much code‚Äù and left ;.;
we need leafyishere to comeback from the dead and roast joe biden
so idk what to do now
like
i just had a bunch of functions feeding into each other
that‚Äôs what i did
i mean because if the way i wrote the code
look at all the other slides those list functions are super useful
its crazy
holy shit
fuck
why?
i really want school to not close
where did you hear it
y‚Äôall we can‚Äôt closeeeeeee
its possible i might be able to stay with my sister here after next week so maybe we can do stuff adam idk
traveling home on the train is gunna be fun :vvvvv
you see where i'm going with this
the lirr isn't!
okay guys but like i have to drive all the way home by myself
saturday at 1
ive taken amtrack here three times before
stop
8 hours ;.;
i've done 3
that would have been the cost for a one way ticket
fair
that‚Äôs so expensive
that sounded super passive aggressive my bad
no ik it is but its the only way
this is bout to be me at you guys
anyone wanna grab dinner in a few?
so i need a break

i fucked up the quote anyways
<:jermajup3:511340248085823488> <:jermajup4:511340248823889927>
my brains still got some growin to do
hey emil
how?
thats how you get his force upwards.
so if the list is like [1,2,3,4,5] and you give it 2,5 it's gonna return 7/2
patrick that's really good
congrats
it doesnt include the endpoints
yeah
so functionname(list(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0)) returns a function then you give that function the parameters (2.0, 5.0)
yeahhh
my grandma went to some agent since i wasnt on my mom or dad's taxes the past 2 years
7/2 = 3 in scalaworld
yeah
we all float on ok
i blame python
python spoil u?
well you can do it in scala too, just in scala it converts non-int ratios to ints, whereas python changes to a float.
i give up idk whats wrong with my code
and also ‰∏≠ÊñáÂæàÈöæ
list(2.0, 1.5, 8.1, 4.0, 9.0, 4.1, 2.2, 7.0, 3.6, 2.2, 4.5, 7.5)
i thought you'd find the average between two points
indices are ints
no comment
so i take it we're doing nothing?
although maybe we should do something thursday?
i‚Äôm uncomfortable
thats fine
how did i do dat
don't want anyone left out or feeling weird ya know.
ofc i'm not gunna be a dick and just start drinking lol
(now the real question is... wtf do i do with the vodka lmao.)
