that always tastes good and its good for you if youre sick right?
it is emil it is...
derivitive of cos is -sin
and if you derive again
derivative of sin is cos
derivative of cos(2x) is -2sin(2x) then derivative of that is -4cos(2x)
inside stays the same
oof i didnt finish my lab
also they really dont like me there
why did you have to remind me this existed

don‚Äôt you have the heater switch?
i dont think i do no

when is it
you make 5 different expressions using any logical operators you want
it can be any compound proposition
we've been betrayed
it should cost way less, right?
yeah the pharmecutical companies hog the medicare money atm
how are people falling for ads like this?  have they never heard of any other first world countries?
anyone else goes for a trade job (which rn is very high paying) and other people can work jobs for unskilled people
neat
what if instead of cinnamon toast crunch it was garlic toast crunch
can you don't
psychology, education, criminology, political science all fall under liberal arts.
i dislike this lq
autograder is trolling me
yeah idk what it was
but at this point it‚Äôs not worth it
transhumanism baby
trying to study for chinese
i feel that
lekker dingen
i mean that's the first half of a trick right
my skateboard laned under some dudes car
wait this new set is just $10 per box? i got that other box for fucking $30 goddamn
oh shit
yessss
theres still snow in someparts of the campus and some parts of campus are just compleatly unreadable.
have you guys ever  seen vileplume's original red/green design
ok then
so x^2 can look like 9
yeah lol
alright
i know your leading coefficient is a
so if you have both positive you wanna use tangent
yeah the book comes with a code for the class's webassign for the semester
wait
i gave up anyways
wait what
maybe we coded it in a way that works but he didnt expect
yeah
i think i did in the moment
no i didnt brute force
i really shouldve saved the code somewhere
oh right i didnt put in the test cases
ill do it anothher time i dont feel like doing anything rn
also i just dont kmnow what else to test but whetevs
tfw na actually has a chance to win an esports int championship
neat, what game
i shouldve known lol
ty ty
how the hell do they really just not give us a kitchen
only hot water source is the damn showers and bathroom sinks
woah this is a great int champ
wow great game!
damn, feel better!
oh yeah btw i saw parasite
it's the best live action movie i've seen
ugh ive missed 3 191s now
i wanted to try to go today but i slept too long
this may have been the reason i failed half my tests
i cannot fucking stand how buggy ub infinite is
i can't finish module one bc of this one stupid error...
syntax in python is very strict, it may be spacing
it is
i did'
ok well if you tried everything you probably would get it right
you‚Äôre probably missing something
it might also be that you‚Äôre returning a different value than auto grader is looking for
write a function named "tweets" that takes a string as a parameter and returns the number of messages required to send the input to the world. note: the maximum length for a single message is 280 characters
if you‚Äôre going to show code, you can show it to me but i cannot tell you the answer
what is the output supposed to be?
mine was so shit though
unless its assigned to a variable
now back to my dorm because holy fuck walking from su to baldy was hell
you good?
rlly
come over to give
*govs
i also bought spoons for some reason instead of forks
feel better mine
thanks
honest to god that lab was awful
i already made it but thanks
the interview was so stressful too
my interview was shit he had to guide me through like all of it because the terminology is nonsense
what if i dont remember what i did
they just kinda ask you about how you did the lecture questions
no i know
for general peoples
it creates a pointer in mem
and creates a personal stack kind of thing?
so in stack, theres a pointer to heap where lets say a certain val is that you can change
lets say you have multiple objects, do you also have multiple heaps?
good catch
ahhhh i see lmao
i just realized
but ye the movie was god-tier
just onset panic attack due to caffeine i'm ok it wears of eventually.
also death
honestly
yo i'll eat dinner soon
or if tomorrow works better we could do that too
sorry got a text b4 i could even finish that sentence and pressed enter
i'm gunna pick up some tim bitz and ride my skateboard over there and head back to govs
tfw you forgot you can edit discord msg (smh)
the internet has interesting ideas of what people want
also jake let‚Äôs go eat
so we should really do the movie night tomorrow?
ight omw
so maybe tonight would be better for me
ive got my math rec in an hour and a half i dont wanna miss the quiz grade
squeezing into the inbetween space of a couch and emerging in the couch dimension
youre just jealous that you know not of the couch dimension
hope you feel better soon
the couch dimension
otherwise we lose patrique
intrigue
faith
power
milk tastes good once more
what???
i am but a litol crichur,
alas a contributor to nightmare fuel :)
my inheritance batteries worked perfectly despite not changing my tests which didn't work for the normal batteries
i shouldnt complain considering its an -000 but i dunno i just like it more when scp articles are just about an object
like this is good but i feel like itd be better as a tale
i'm no author though
bro what was that ending
dinner*
i want to use up my meal swipes, and i'm not really going to be hungry for a while
that answer both fell into the yes and no category emil.
i just really want wendy's lol
both of your propositions were true though
i used a negation operator
t ‚àß ¬¨ f == f
‚Äòtwas foolish of you to second-guess my flawless logic
y‚Äôall still down for shawshank tonight?
~~i was wondering if maybe we wanted to stop at wendy's if theres one along the way~~
(sorry pat)
sure!
and i can pick y‚Äôall up wherever
so popcorn???
yes popcorn
god damnit my friend is indecisive af. i gotta help it after class it should take no more than 30 min
him*
i feel bad making you walk
i‚Äôm chilling

i wanna take being healthy for granted again
thats what i told myself i woukd do after winter break

im always irrationally afraid the busses will collide when they pass by eachother
oh alright we‚Äôre here
ight i'll be over in 5
what's poppin? i'm eatin at the cellar rn.
i like my slippers medium-rare
god ive missed 6 polscis in a row now
and i didn't even ask for less ice
doom and animal crossing are the best fucking duo
also my program still gives errors for some reason :/
god that kid is the embodiment of kringe with a k
he‚Äôs outta here
i'll be there around 6 because i do have to go to the gym
sounds like it's time for a war
i was working on the physics engine
downstairs
not a fan of any of the options at the dining hall, so i got a tiny bit of everything
dining hall was very meh tonight
so i got a bit of everything
i'm immediately gravitated to the potatoes
i should have just got potatoes
i take it back this corned beef rice dish is pretty sweemb
i'm sad he's at the forefront of gaming as a competitive sport (or game whatever you wana call it).
and expects everyone to act as stupid and childish as ninja.
guys i might need some help bext year
help with what?
winning sa presidency for our junior year
prepare for disappointment
he name dropped kali oml
you gotta read the whole convo when you get a chance
he said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs gotta be some kali linux thing‚Äù
who tf is rahul
that was craaazy
nothing has ever brought me more anxiety than submitting my physics engine
setting up the bowling pins
fun, good, amazing
he‚Äôs in our class
i don‚Äôt remember
is jesse actually wrong?
i used kali to break passwords
does he have any friends?
exactly
yeah
i imagine so
i cant wait to never have calc 2 again
just wait till hw after calculator ;)
hey adam
can u help me out with something...
i need to go to the mall
actually or saturday
yeah i‚Äôm sorta busy tonight but maybe saturday?
bc i cannot for the life of me get them out.
the heater was on like two days ago yet it keeps getting shut off for some fucking reason
we should get together and watch the mario bros movie
its just collision on a 2d plane
(ours are squares though not circles but i imagine that shouldnt change anything)
and then we use theta for
something
yea then you can make them vectors
in a 2d space
im hoping once i properly get these formulas in just by the laws of physics they wont be inside of eachother because that is a problem rn
they are compleatly seperate
that is how things work
this is just coding rather than physics now
well make sure when they collide they aren't traveling in the same direction
i mean they have to be since one weighs more
and not
our only test subjects here are the players
which have a set movement speed
and their x velocity goes back to 0 if you let go of the input
gonna die when i see autolab wants to say my tests are wrong
well its at least finding the tests and some work
found another
its ok
some good alt rock for yall
test cases break my soul part 83
time to go on another adventure to find a classroom
i mean for todays lq
why is my code broken
you know what
youre just constantly stuck just barely failing and end up stuck with a 0
iee's robot kinda sucks tbh
sends dad video of pete fabricating black support again, he tells me to work for pete
is this how buttigieg supporters operate?  mentioning pete's name = endorsing mayor pete
my eyes
patrick fun fact
lmao
my brain is immense
i've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement
epic
blah delivery room opens late today
cyndaquil is the best!
yugioh attained
ah ok
its just some shitty side elective i just need to pass
"damndaniel" the geodude
"cringe rat" the sentret
"rat 2?" the rattata
no more fruit by the foot for me to eat
what did you guys do?
yooo how was it
found out
my friend from long island drove up here to see the same concert
wacky
i was in tears when he showed up (we haven't seen eachother for like 2 years bc of shit that happened)
too cold to move
still feel dizzy
i was at an 11 last night :v
i wasn't wasted
emptie stomach + as much as you drank. yea... you were feelin nothin
so i went to an 11
after that last shot with mike the last thing i remember was throwing up on the lawn
if you get stuck feel free to ask me vague questions
alrighty
which one?
is yours still named tojson?
thanks
how do you import the json stuff
does anyone have the dependency i need?
you have to convert to json before making the map?
head hurt.
should just be !
so can i do (6-x)!
does it just go towards 0
its for hw.
reminds me i have 3 calc assignments to do by monday afternoon
wtf das wrong apparently ;.;
just to be safe
how do you find the derivative of a function under a sqrt
ightg
which still isn't correct
its chain rule so you multiply by the derivative of the inside
in general if your brain is weirding out trying to derive/integrate something
shoot me now
bruh
yea they really want ppl to fuck the colonel
what why does it specifically say west virginia
idk man
its like gen 2 but you can go anywhere anytime and everything scales to how many badges you have so its like "open world"
didn‚Äôt wanna put my art anywhere else
i don't even know what a reverb or a master bus is
oh hey theres only two assignments on webassign
and even the functions you use to determine that error margin have an error margin of their own
oh its for when youre using midpoint
i think im gonna not look at mine
ohhh its on autograder
yo people who have a desktop in govs
mine just says do the lecture questions
then it‚Äôs big and in the way
oh you mean the actual computer not the monitor
probably underneath your desk would be the best, right?
lecture questions
lets see
3 of them
with voting i just get all errors from autolab
7:00 in clinton sound good?
sounds good to me. my ass still is broken.
yeah feel free
i can just rent it for $4
i remember why i didnt try doing this previously
actually if it‚Äôs in a 1st floor lounge i don‚Äôt really care where
makes sense
just a test that isn't working
typical
well still not working great
just think of the graph of tanx
and still have no clue how to stop getting errors in this damn battery program
me too
on piazza
tbh neither do i
thats what the battery thing is about
yeah i know but what does check your references mean
im so sick of stack and heap and stuff
im just going to go to the ta tomorrow
and doing that changed nothing still failing 3 tests
and somehow my old code solved recharge
thinkin i‚Äôll just bite that bullet
it's not
testing more makes things worse!
ill be there in 15
also do yall know what happened at bailey ave?
tas take time i want things solved now
lol ok
uhhhh
there was a shooting
i saw the news
just now
on interwebs
where we droppin
clinton
sure
hahah oops !!
you‚Äôre good it‚Äôs just me and tom rn
def robobaby(robot1, robot2):
      if robot1 and robot2 = yes:
              return (robotbaby)
      else:
              return(nobotbaby)
parasite can barely reach top 5 movies of the year
dammit a bus made it to govs but i couldnt reach it in time
oh yeah
guess who barely made it for chicken fries
which is why they made the records think she died
why would she even hint at it
her entire purpose at that point was to prevent the spread of any info
he knew it was a girl from the orphanage
they were her memories
from the orphanage
no she is a private contractor who doesnt have a full job with an company
eat the rich yall
i concede the plot makes sense
well i think the point was to convince us that he was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù so to speak, because at that point he believed it too
knives out never tries to trick youit just makes you think with what information you have and it drip feeds that info
knives out literally tells you who did it in one quick scene you just have to pay attention
they were programed with memory to have human feelings and emotion though
and they didnt even try to play it in an interesting way
it feels like they just forgot to have him feel things
your not interupting, that was my complete thought
yessir
i am
i mean i got like 3 tests out in one submission
and i absolutely love the artistic direction of the movie coupled with the soundtrack
i think over time we will begin to understand everybody's tastes
yeah
i think the way we feel about the style in a movie is the most subjective part.  it's almost like taste in music.
check every object lol
mine is under my desk
up to submission thirty two baby
why does it fail the correct solution it doesnt make sense
ok gamers what do we have to know for this 191 quiz
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
it doesnt tell us what to name the trader constructors in the tradeagreement class
ugh why the hell am i getting errors
got lost
i'm there now tho
where the hell is my lab person
appparently our ta did the interviews wrong??
please
so thank you but its ik
ok now im in 316
i'm laughin so hard at this hypothetical
without teapots
if it converges
so many questions
a(t) is 1/(t^p) btw
what is an interval of integration what does that mean im so dead
yes that is what those words mean but i have no clue what that means in terms of calculus
i could go to tutoring but thats just paying again to be told the same stuff again
may 19th baby
hm that timing is awkward
finals end the 16th
if anyone wants to eat anywhere lmk
got me 3 hashbrowns
aa salt in my eyes
i'd prob put your computer there
man theres fuckin noone in my 116 room
states are ez
~~totally didnt wait to see if i got the 1.0 before sending that~~
im just so genuinely confused as to what is wrong
me 2
what?
what is there?
how do you push to an array of strings
list doesnt have .split() though
time to press control z a lot
states are fucking awful with readability you have to go between 50 different files
i submitted it too many times and idk what to do im about to cry
theyre useful and good but readability is by no means a plus for them
oh i just had a brain moment
well
decimals are
i think i have a calc exam
not now
without picking anyone up
its in service
fear
er rather "dont try to replace numbers"
trying to replace the numbers is what had me stuck
well through a very weird circle/figure 8 this bus got to the student union
fucking front bottoms
bruh
music is old man
snowpiercer yes, castle of cagliestro is cool, goldfinger is fine, why is the room on there
and every single miyazaki movie
i've heard the garzey's wing dub is extremely funny
time to pull out the mega classics
yeah but cat people has cats in it
so we can culture these people on alternetives to watching cats
i refuse to stop
i wanna see the big sleep and cassablanca in a quieter environment tbh
north by northwest
then i go
duck soup
the circus
i only picked movies i havent seen
now we're switching genres
the godfather is a no cuz most people have seen it and its long af
nop im liosting movies you cant stop me
the red balloon ooh what a beautiful movie
we are gonna end up watching the emoji movie at this rate
if there are 100 options and the emoji movie is one, people are gonna wanna see that most
then we go and say ooh what about the shining
the shining is good, there are better movies tho
and then i hit you with another one of the greatest movies of all time
battleship potempkin
that is a movie that exists
then dont even talk to me
you havent even seen the red balloon
and then i come out here with another classique francaise
le havre
die hard
but newer ones by the coen brothers
big lebowski
cowboy bebop is the best western
no country for old men
as in get out of this discord channel
why?
waking life is p great
cool
what a masterpiece
dodgeball, the wedding singer, and love on a leash
did you watch kung fury with us?
oh shit i forgot about that one jackass movie with the grandpa
that one was great
bad grandpa
i gave it a 7 cuz it made me laugh alot
it's prolly my fav. official 2d main series mario game
my favorite 2d mario game is super mario 63
hot takes
my favorite mario game is paper mario ttyd
huh?
harvey weinstein is a ub alumn what
what
theres a butterscotch in the condom box
check the names of everything
then it‚Äôs a problem with your code
which one is it?
i have physics and it makes me wana die
i was actually gonna go to pistachio‚Äôs at like 6
can't do like 5:30?
aight
because i am laze
i mean dying but that works too
that‚Äôs like a 87
thanks bro
87.5 exactly
which is i think better than i did on the second unit test
is that a b+?
i think so?
maybe a-
it‚Äôs an a-in mine üòÑ
i think i got like an 84-85
90 is an a guaranteed
yeah
i‚Äôm really quite excited about thursdays meeting
> and if all else fails, bend over and kiss your ass goodbye. i'm not kidding. that could actually help.
>
ugh you reminded me i have my calc 2 exam tomorrow
im so dead
key mapping?
literally an actual ace attorney case
12 chuggas before a choo-choo
no that‚Äôs 8 you fiend
it‚Äôs expert analysis though
it goes nanananananananan nananananananana
now my brain is saying 24 na's
just watch the batman theme, it repeats in sets of 8 nanas
its wack
fixed
in before it takes me a year to complete
so hopefully i could do
list(5, ".", 2, "+", 6, "*", 3, "=")
plug that into my function, and then the display should be 33.6
so i dont see the problem with another
shit
my roommate says 10 and he's probably right
thing.isinstanceof[class]
doesnt work
unless you ask me
ill probably help if you ask me
ok yeah this was absurdly easy to fix
i dont even know how to approach calculator atm
im just chilling and thinking about stuff
that‚Äôs a bruh moment
lol nope
ugh i just remembered i still need to figure out lq2
one test made me have to rework how the numbers in my calculator work but it wasnt actually so hard
not even so tedious
problem is i dunno what to do now lol
bernie has a rape fantasy fetish?
that's a little yikes ngl
okay so he wrote an early feminist work?
yeah
hell even if it were a bad thing (it very explicitly isnt though) why is it relevant it was written over 50 years ago
theyre trying to own bernie with something that by no means of the imagination could ever rationally be an own
i saw a good tweet earlier explaining the bernie essay but i cant find
oh wait its the one i sent already
so basically, bernie > trump
he compared sanders to hitler
basically the idea of the essay is that society forces women to submit to the point where they internalize it and fantasize of having any autonomy being taken away (i think)
he prolly paid alot of money for that line too
they keep trying that and its just
so strange
a million is a lot less than a billion i dont know why its so hard for them to grasp
good things!!
it seems like a stock centrist democrat policy list
because i finally got the number functionality to work
hey i meant it in a glass half full kind of way
idk if i even wanna look
where are they posted?
and yiiiikes
yeah i know
that‚Äôs good
he certainly follows the centrist motto of "things are totally fine we promise"
that sucks
oh shit
aight
i'll head out now
big rhip
its not like he avoids the question
no i‚Äôm not
he is not
it was 7pm until 2nd grade (i think) then it was 8pm until middle school
and by bedtime it meant bedtime like tv off and everything
oh...
jeez guys okokok.
very straange that all of you
its mar 6th
is it the same for you guys?
there is a workshop in nsc tomorrow on how to apply
aparently you can create a group
good photo discord :v
shall i?
imma do et anyways
camouflage is a good song
i joined
i should have named it crack side
he actually made this video
nevermind he isn't actually saying it might be the best movie
this is just how he decided to name his review series
eyyyyyyyyy
so they oppose all socialist programs?
because of bonus slide
welp i already got the 1 so
oh the lecture question
it got removed
what is a state?
i'm confused
i feel like i've programmed with states for a lecture question, but i'm really good at forgetting stuff
i dunno how youd use booleans without control flow/alternative control flow
you can use them as parameters in states
so your code breaks
i need to make sure im doing it right
i dont need/wanna see the actual code obviously
i think im doing it right but the wording is super vague
how about you private message someone your constructor and we'll tell you if its right?
mind if i show you
i think i know why but i cant say
just gotta think about it
every time ive tried it just sucks and nothing happens
they turned batman into smart detective into dumb brute
it was in the list of best movies of the decade
i've never seen, or i just dont remember, man of steel
i'm guessing you sent that article as a meme then
i've been wanting to write reviews for awhile
probably not correctly!
but i answered them
hmm.... still living in trash smell is no good
i dont put anything that would smell in my trash can.  i just walk over to the nearest communal trash can.
small price to pay for a room that doesn't constantly smell like garbage
i dont wanna end up like jerry and elaine in "the smelly car"
btw i have a cold and it is causing me to cough
now i dont
i just went to elicott but i can come back over to govs or wherever
what do y‚Äôall wanna do?
i mean i dunno if theres much to do at elicott
i could bring my switch or something but idk what we'd play
true true
come over and help me do my ‰∏≠ÊñáÂäüËØæ
hmmm
[no in chinese]
yeah uhhhh i could not helped
i mean fair
govs is probably best
alright
imma take a shower then join ya guys
im not gonna lie i kinda wanna eat first
food at cellar is so inconsistant
imma wat too then
ill bring my controllers then just in case
idk where patrick is
i passed you cause you said you were at sizzles
my b
hm true
true true
heading to clinton rn
bus taking forever to get here
typical
accurate
holy fuck i forgot in the manaphy movie ash actually fucking drowns to death
how dare you
thing
right
i wish i took that advice
and not my friends
emotionally i suddenly feel like shit :v
no i think i'll be ok, its cause idk i haven't been keeping myself busy so...
i like snow
thats wack
if i were in that scenario id probably just ignore them/exclude them from my life to the best of my ability
mask fucking off
i‚Äôm going to get dinner in an hour, would anyone care to tag along?
i just eat them at room temperature
that‚Äôs what sane people do
toaster is excusable but bad
microwaving and freezer are the only methods listed on the box and that deeply upsets me
actually you pick
isabelle animal crossing is getting married
oy vey
life points are the least relevant resource in the game
you could revive a whole field for just a bit over half your starting lifepoints
if it were like 3k per monster maybe i wouldnt be so bewildered by it (itd still be banned though)
mori-mori-mori-mori-mori-o-cho radiooo (morio cho radioo)
i mean
it ain't bad
it aint bad
but if given the option to toast it
you toast it
and toast it in the toasting machine.
im livid
and right before i got to it
anyone wanna do anything
holy shit that‚Äôs not good
i just
its death without the cost
yea im not even gunna push my luck today
a shit in a box
i was there for the whole emily eviction talk yesterday so i feel like i know a decent bit
yeah thats gross of her
ebic
full 180
lmao
and i sure as hell havent seen it
cause everyone hates her
and it seems like theyre entirely right to
i mean huff is the right word if you're with the right substance.
1.0 for tv was a lot easier than i thought
i implimented one of the things wrong and it failed three tests lol
for me, it didnt work, then i put in some print statements and it ran in intellij
very much a bruh moment (john certified)
basically if you start from scratch you may notice something incredibly small you may not have before
thing is theres not much to look through so ive combed it over quite a few times
but then for some reason the test said it was returning a char?!
and it took me 8 submissions to figure out that all i needed to do was keep the parentheses even though intellij says its an error
yeah i always hear the wind outside my window
its annoying and loud
i dont wanna go to a ta for this i hate going to tas and it would just be a waste of time
theres 0 reason for this to be an errors what the hell
it only fives me an error when i call the function you define in tradeagreement
i have parentheses at the end
this makes no sense whatsoever
its probably something you'd never think of thats really small
are you not allowed to use == in your testtrading or something?
i literally cannot fathom why this doesnt work
im just doing assert(item == otheritem)
so for some reason it doesnt like what im asserting
theres no way to test for this without doing something ive tried
come to the cellar, i have fries
~~it just freaks me out and i cant~~
its not a problem of me worrying about others its just
i mean you wanted to sleep right
oops...
ok note to self don't do that again.
am not smart
i reaaaaaally hope this geography quiz has a word bank
ok so the quiz was absurdly easy to cheat on
i only cheated for 1 answer though
but since its on computer i just
since ublearns cant detect cheating afaik
oh shit
best thing to do is wash your hands thoroughly all the time, especially before you eat
maybe its my brain wanting to feel secure but really i dont think its so serious to need to worry about masks (in our area, obviously there are places where masks are a good idea)
oh the masks don‚Äôt really help much either
im just gonna not let people sneeze on me
but you can get it through your eyes
i didnt get ebola and im not getting this
shhhhhhh
lmao
when i was on south one time i was running to the bus and the wind legit held me in place
i reiterate
this morning
its never with you
wind is fake
but like reverse windmills
thats where our tuition goes
just had to dig my phone out of a garbage cab
me in 220 atm:
so i got one of my kerbals to space.
now i need to get him down...
fuk...
take my first ee class
next semester
i don't know what chipotle monday is
why that one tho?
ohhh
yeah im in
loads of mock trial people
i'm down if i can get a lift
impossible shifts üò°
oh wait i don't have meal credits
can you get in with dinning?
or go to the commons
byt still gunna go for food
eh sure why not
i never realized how far back the commons goes
i may not go, just because dorming group wanted to eat to talk about dorming possibilities
it ok
no dying on my watch üëÄ
rip i missed all this i was at my honors thing
i left 5 extras incase i have to prune
üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ
all of my roommate's stuff is gone (literally everything) and i dont know where he is
like literally everything?
entirely moved out
that‚Äôs insane
do i just live alone now??
the beans?????
i mean the beans werent his we tossed them day one lol
once i clean it up anyways
that‚Äôs badass
bruh put the beds together
plus i dont have queen sheets or anything
that‚Äôs kind of awesome though
i never really interacted with him but youd think he'd say if he was leaving
or at least leave a note
i sorta like having my little gremlin corner tbh
i guess if he meant to tell me today he was leaving he wouldn't have had the chance since i wasn't at the dorm any time he could tell me since he wakes up late but still you'd think he'd leave a note or smth
that's bad
yeah
+ works
but thats it
like functionality or do they not do anything at all
they dont do anything
for the onclick method
only for +
no like for addpressed()
subtractpressed(), dividepressed() and multiplypressed() all dont work
i wanna help but i dont wanna technically violate ai even though i trust you lol
its mostly a technical issue though
you probably know it all already but never hurts to be sure
thats all the basic stuff i think
i figured it out
niiice
thats exclusively the bad part of spelunking
exactly
anyway we should go sometime
yeah
also im almost done with calculator i made some significant improvements to my code
only 12 classes now
‚Äúhmm
yeah i should explore here‚Äù
so i did
mission failed: we'll get 'em next time
i guess so long as im not alone
it‚Äôs like a different world down there
i have a bday party but it might end early
he‚Äôs gonna be 19
boomer
happy 19 years surviving the establishment ü•≥
and with only 17 classes!
i see how it is smhsmh üò§
that little plus sign there
yeah
hell yeag
yeah
how can we be cool furries now
whats even the fucking point
im gonna get it
<:him:683332731694088282>
something about it just feels so wrong
it still looks good and is still hand drawn but something about the style is so charming
shoutouts to illegal streaming sites
the physics exam went well
think i did ok
i'm an upsetting person patrick am sorry
imma go get breaky
??????
still
this picture has an energy and i cannot and refuse to describe it
more than usual though
dun think so
my god damn pokemon movie keeps buffering
apple burger
he's stuck in orbit
also was wondering if anyone wanted to do anything today?
im down to do something yeah
deoxys himself is cg what the hell i dont remember that
maybe they tried it here then realized "oh yeah this sucks"
he fucking evaporated deoxys i forgot that part
hes dead
unless of course those are additive in which case fuck
thats unlucky
yeah just gimme a few min
yeah its just one error that i didnt get
otherwise its pretty straightforward
if you ask for "chips without chip?"
ive got no clue how to do this without a bit of control flow
cause theres no limit to the speed so even if i wanted i cant just use an absurd amount of classes
yeah it doesnt
it fixed car but
dylan reccomended (wonderfully so imo) monty python
i havent watched life of brian but i've heard amazing things about it
~~the pokemon first movie remake is on netflix~~
ok so i got the 1.0 but my tests for objective 2 and 3 made errors
rhs_decimal
lecture question is messin me upp
ugh ai sucks because i wanna help but i cant
i have literally the same problem
honestly if you do the homework you show you understand states
too bad
ugh i got the last test to work but now theres an error elsewhere
for which lq?
bruh i'm losing my minddddd
my tests are like 100 lines
is it still showing 1.0 for you emil?
why do i not have 1.0
but it isnt
no but it is
functionality incomplete means your code didn‚Äôt pass jesse‚Äôs tests
why the hell
my calculator has 1000 lines of tests
if you do like
[0, ., 0, 0, 0] for your inputs
does it show 0.000 or 0.0
yeah
if this doesn't work i'm dropping 116
everything works how it should
nice
||ooga booga look at dms||
yeah but theres a billion possible things that my problem could be and i dont know how to find it
ive checked every possible thing i can think of
with repeated commands?
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
ignore my other tabs
while you solve car question i sleep from gravity amd and newton's 2nd law
i did
[6, -, 9, *, 3] and it gave 18 instead of -3
now it does
good
damn im sorrrryyyyyyy
oh yay i also have rhs decimal working now
my last submission before i noticed my flaw got all the tests running
ive got 11
11 bananas?
i dunno if i should say but ive got
its when i do like
[5, ., 5, +, 3, *, /, 5]
but i suppose i must
fuck everyone
i remove the trucks of my skateboard
and use the board
and go down the side of the natural arts center
ok i got all the üôÇ too
i had no reason to doubt you
yeah
just in case
so i just did it all in one swoop
sure
i had 1000 lines of testing lol
not general purpose
i have no reason to lie to you guys
that's a wonderful observation patrick
i look so dumb carrying a board with no trucks
it made no sense
shit i forgot my wallet
the snow is too loght4
i'mma still do to su
i'll be there in 15 min
sorry
ok den....
sounds good to me
or i can just message dylan
i'll let you know
consumerism is a hell of a drug
tonight, clinton, preferably sometime between 8 and 9, it will last about 2 hours, and the movie will be monty python's life of brian
even though nothing makes sense eith where its placed my room feels way more homey after moving the bed
push emil
i gotta do lq and honors colloq shit and hw2 dor 191 and hw2 for 116
the two beds
that works
damn
we go to canada
with drinks
why are you like a person who's off the grid
i have left the country once
i wonder
ugh moving everything would be such a pain though
my room is finally not an absolute disgrace
i really need a vaccuum though
godfather next week btw
life of brian was very very good üëå
i agree
the religion stuff was good
ohh, i understand
obviously a fair bit of it is a result of the times but still it was just
i sorta freak out whenever i can see my breath my brain goes like "did i smoke??"
is it windy?
not so bad considering other days
the wind these days has been a force to be reckoned with
it wasnt bad really
speak for yourself
#nofacialhairsquad
oh yeah i have cable
i have more memes, but i'll spare you
deadlifts, 2xpull ups, bench fly's, bench, incline bench, dumbbell rows, stright arm pull overs, cable crossovers, 2x dips, leg tucks, then core
it works i imagine
i got sick last weak so i gotta do shoulders, abs, and legs
i dont think so but look at the example sheet for quantifiers on piazza resources it shows the equivalent
we don‚Äôt wanna watch it in govs
yeah
i need shower
but i need clothes
shower
its alright youve got time probably
i'm just gonna take the l with leg day
on autograder
and i did it at 12am-3am today
wanna check out the weird basements now while we got time?
for prepardness
ill come get ya
accidentally slammed my door
fuck?
also for the record im not trying to say the movie isnt good
its sorta a similar discussion bladerunner 2047 had but focused on a different part of the discussion
apparently the greatest coen brothers movies
textbook
goddamn theyre trying to make mewtwo wrong but
hes saying humans are unfit to rule the world because humans suck (very fair considering his experiences) but also pokemon are unfit to rule due to their willingness to serve and maintain the status quo of humans ruling over pokemon
also i promise my lack of entertainment regarding themes isnt a cover for my complete lack of ability to notice them in most cases
no like i feel like you understand that they‚Äôre there you just don‚Äôt appreciate them
still pissed they took out brother my brother
im very glad that they didnt toss out the message that the circumstances of your birth are irrelevant and that youre still human (or a pokemon) nonetheless
goddamn i need to sleep now
instead of things continuing with the characters learning things
they rewind time but things are slightly different and make no sense and things just dont happen
ill really shut up now i promise
time to do my homework
i dont know what that is but it sounds amazing
the description mentions songs
üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ
im too sleepy to watch it now though
i can do something
i‚Äôm a simple man
i love how within the canon of the game nikola tesla became a brutal dictator
he used electricity to make a shield around the city to keep snow out
and it worked
both are great games
i just got out the gym
and i should finish my physics
ugh i need more milk already
anyhow its not like when you jump off a building your horizontal movement is constant
holy fuck my hair looks awful rn and i just went out in public
why is all the candy at the eli way harder than it should be
he'd be dominating the other candidates too if not for warren
maybe a little less
jake i really think youre underestimating it
the universe is actually shaped like this
i agree with patrick on this one
15 parallel universes
damn
goddamn it adam i spilled the drink you left here
this is your fault i refuse to accept blame
i knew it was there im just lazy and didnt get rid of it despite having the chance
ü§î ü§î ü§î
why did i even turn on the lamp
dont look up "monke"
stinky
what
i just know uh oh stinky monkey is known as le monke
thats more twitch than 4chan
im referring to "le monke"
good weather
just because someone has used monke in that way doesnt mean that's what monke is
sonic promare
all i know is that i needed to punish someone for my witnessing of this and i chose you all
absurd
patrick be like:
def main(args: array[string]): unit = {
    println("hell world!")
}
oh it's not that, i just thought kanye's pic was funny and that pinknews is making said trans woman act like the ultimatum for kanye lol
trans people are fine
i really should :/
also which house
not far at all
bl is my fav
im finally doing my gd playthrough
i don't know what that means :v
i never have time
fair
and after you do that campaign you can recruit them in normal gameplay
but i should
my grandma is 70 today
neat
i just witnessed geese attempting to swim upstream and they were barely managing
yay!
featherless biped moment
was featherless biped plato?
plato be like f0rms!
all the gen 3 and gen 2 starters are great (and i will not stand for chikorita slander they learn razor leaf at level 8)
oh i looked further on the page that icon means biped with tail
obviously things could be simplified but if you use enough words you could describe anything
like in terms of general structure
war breaks out
i do know that
i mean think about it
it also exists so the church can use these child soldiers for their dirtywork lol
i said fucking as an explitive not a verb
the meaning of life is |redacted|
is this philosophy or fire emblem
i should listen tbh :v
wow i cant believe the war in congo is a fire emblem reference
(my grandma and grandpa use the same phone)
its wack seeing these kids so casual with real guns strapped to them
yeah romanized
itd be cooler if it was kept in cyrilic
and then learning that there is a english word for strange things
oh behavioralism
behavioralism makes a lot of sense but also the potential of it being reality terrifies me
after i get out of class
wanna go to berts?
sure i'll be in the dining room
so its in the center of autofill
so nothing lost really
i fixed my fucking code
warren just fucking drop out already please god
it's actually a really bad error
i have no clue how to fix it but i found it
no i think i will
tip: look at what happens when you press other operators while in the multiply state and think about what your left and right hand values are
(also look at division too)
tip: i am so fucking mad
no its a reference to that arthur meme
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i think i see where the issue is
mhmmmm
yeah
the offset makes that look so goofy
i wonder
could you have nested states
nested states bruh
cold spark
i mean i guess you could have two state vars
no i mean like
i'm bout to monkeybrain the shit out of this problem
so like
multiplydec extends multiply
state extends state
also dreamweaver is ded
state extends self
the software dreamweaver
trading class for me
yea ik
king shit
please
noita got workshop support
thats terrifying
you know what i mean
oh yay we finally got the 1st project for cse 115
but i‚Äôm prolly gonna
wait what
i just dont understand how to approach it yet
no var lol
oh it‚Äôs ez
yeah so i‚Äôm skipping now
i dont get this
i thought recursion would be ez üò¶
i'm starting to get it
i had an idea of what i should do so i just fiddled with it slightly until it worked
no but i started it
i like this
that was uhhhh
i'm done
good
anyone want lunch?
could go for some sush
i'll figure it out
like written, not a video
jesses websites have some good links
right?
thats not ai right?
today 8:00?
its only a light scratch i was more scared of breaking something
after the forth time i failed to drop in felt my sholder pop and landed directly on my knee
sure works for me
it's almost like the progressive cause isn't her goal
do you guys think i can pass with a 0 on the first 2 191 assignments and an f on the first test?
thas why i'm tryna understand this stuff as quickly as possible
are you not passing functionality?
primary objective does not pass all tests
does it have to just be like if you pressed operators consecutively after each other it just does the last one?
should i abandon those 25 points in favor of microwave coding?
i'm thinking this might be optimal
yeah
oy vey
yeah the project might also be a rip cuz i still dont get the state programming
i shouldve asked more questions in my lab, but i've failed every lab cuz they never answer my questions
thanks gamers
that‚Äôs awesome!
lets give it 10 min
i cant avoid my jokes getting stolen üò≠ üò≠
did any of you gentleman do the microwave
im chilling with the calc
if anything is
movies
ok, well i'm available all day today and after 1:30 tomorrow
i can‚Äôt
hey adam
rememver when you made plans on a wednesday
what‚Äôs up jake
christ every time i get back to my dorm and look at my mirror im so embarassed because i was in public with my hair like that
you got me there
also a man tearing his family apart due to his obsession with pokemon
oh i rememeber this vid
my phone was definitely listening yesterday or something
holy shut
we won
geez i dont think ive ever met a single warren supporter irl lmao
calc hurts my brain to the surprise of none
wheres the 81 from the 81dx go
and how is u^1/2 able to just
thats weird and the video didnt explain that
if it doesn‚Äôt you did it wrong
2/243((1+81(82))^(3/2)-(82)^(3/2)) is way more than (2/243)(82sqrt(82)-1)
what so whhy even do all that stuff with u in the first place
it was on the exam
very different
we never completely changed the range of integration
even while u was in there the range was the same
bruh
nothing to do with syntax lol, its just another method of usub
you're overcomplicating it
but yeah we never changed the range
it‚Äôs the same thing
im saying if you don't change the range
exactly
you have to substitute for u then plug in
give me a moment to speak
so i can actually explain
my group would do
integral from 0 to pi/2((e^sin(x))cos(x))dx
u=sin(x)
du=cos(x)dx
->integral from 0 to pi/2(e^u)du
=[e^u] from 0 to pi/2
->[e^sin(x)] from 0 to pi/2
you do that only if you integrate for u to plug in
you did x sub
u sub and x sub are the same until the end
i think maybe on a very technical level yes, but when you do that, you show that you're going to substitute anyways, which is why she didnt take off points
because you still plugged in for x
warren ended her campaign
then resubstitute each fraction and take the integrats of each individual sub
lmao
damn
11 is easy
or do you need its parabolic distance?
no theyre easy those arent the ones i was complaining about
for some reason they couldnt process it if i actually squared a part of it
yeah its curve distance
fuck this i'm goin to the gum
holy shit i'm doing delts and it feels like my sholders gunna pop out of its socket
i need to stop by cvs so i‚Äôll be near su
well...
still at the gym
i‚Äôll just go to cvs in the meantime
across the street
i thought you were at cvs???
lol nope
ight i'm getting jamba and the line is long anyway
kk i kinda want something to eat too
the seats by tim hortons
buying 2 12 packs of fruit by the foots because im a child
anyone else have this?
still cant believe netflix has the audacity to assume i may have something better to do than watch pokemon all day
bro wtf is this shit
this dude had the audacity to take off an extra point just for stating fn=t
god dammit they dont have the whole of the pokemon anime
really though i need something to watch
no one got full credit on the last question
p1-p3 i did amazing on.
p4 i basically got no credit
wow power of us is actually way better than the firdt i choose you movie
but it‚Äôs also very intriguing
bro how
guess what guys
what
you ever just be doing something and then 

```git is not installed```
me setting up intellij like
ya know
that makes sense
over an hour later and we‚Äôre still left guessing üòî
if that works for everyone
last night i think i finished part one of the cse 115 proj.
how come
where are you using centos?
> home

thonk
lemme know if im missing anything important
i'll bring mine
actually
bc idk if i need action from you guys
good on you for being ahead of the game
for some reason in 115 my project 1 literally just didnt work so i had to restart from scratch
yeah
plus id be scared since i dont really know anything about where i am
in reality i should be more scared on south but uhhhhhhhhhh
something something familiarity
man i wish i didn't have to do the website
they prolly changed it cause it was barely 115
we still do as well tho.
i liked the website
yea this is just part 1
ai üëÄ
not relevant really but i liked reading it
hey jake
since this is the 5th ive missed now i believe
that's the wrong professor hertz
that's not even him
that merged eye thing reminds me of something but i dont know what

welcome to 4 chan
up to episode 11 now
i was hoping to achieve 1 for 1 nsfw pics from 4chan
anyway
12:50
i was confused
i already missed the 2 classes i planned to attend so
19 wow am adut
such adulting
indepented
id say an inch but that might be too much
fruit by the cube
chomp
fruit by the rectangular prism
thats long
.1 inch is probably innacurate but eh
.08 √ó .2 √ó 72
2.88 fruit by the cubic feet
right
they are 3 feet each
i got 1.152 cubic feet
1.44 for me
.08 √ó .2 √ó 72
why the second .2
rather than length
then it would be .24
each fruit by the foot is 0.005 fruit by the cubic feet
i‚Äôm full of knowledge
i got one already
how long?
how will the good place gang get out of this wacky scenario??
what?
theres gonna be some wacky workaround next episode
jason just has his memories or something because hes too dumbor whatever
theres the workaround
is it like shitty cakes where its just a sheet that transfers over or whatever
its stack recursion üôÉ
i just set up my dorms for me and my boys, sorry
such is live
im like halfway through 12fl oz of 5%
and i have 18 minutes
i drank and have a lab exam
it took him long enough to finish one drink
i nearly vomited with the last big sips
pro tip. drink water
pro-er tip: drink even more alcohol so you build a tolerance
that sucks
is why i threw up
i need to watch godfather for polsci
any time sensitive stuff?
i might go to the movie night until anthony tells me to leave
lets just have movies tomorrow
hey patrick
here are my suggestions:
adam ive been wanting to do stuff the past 3 nights
scott pilgrim vs the world
and this weekend
what's that?
hmmm
im a major drinker
yeah i googleded it
whyyyy
but lets plan more movie nights in the future
and its a comedy, but also beautiful
should we uh
clinton per usual?
yessir
can you pirate it?
how many semicolons per line?
i can‚Äôt believe that
what is a .then?
so what are you coding again?
calculator
and .then(function) is the way you handle promises in languages that use promises. that's usually a networking thing.
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
so wait who's going
we at a party rn sorry
what movie?
tbh i have nothing to do rn so i‚Äôm down to hang out but we can leave the movie for tomorrow?
smash?
awesome
wait dylan said he‚Äôs going
yeah
hmmm
yeah idk what to do
wonderful
awe are
yes we are
thats not nice
dipshits
jake is hidden behind the guy's arm
i played smash for well over 30 games and only lost twice lol
he is drunk
fuck off pat
i never need to reach that again
but we just split to go to our dorms
alright sleep or continue watching the good place
if it really will kick in in an hour like jake kept insisting (for multiple hours) i wanna be awake for it
sorry i shouldnt have asked for your opinion ans then completely disregarded it i shouldve made it more clear that was rhetorical
you and jake yeah
which is how i feel
aww shit i misse dthe new su future episodes
like eleanor was sorta
doomed to be a bad person
it acknowledges everything
it‚Äôs really smartly written imo
hopefully they give me a reason to have less disdain for uhhhhhhh
whats her name
yeah
how could you hate herrrrrrr
:ccccc
no that was a flashback
same
i dont watch them live
i occasionally catch him live
ngl janet is one of my favorite characters
fuckin french
eh we're all going to hell anyway
but really
i mean
well i mean one is from the bible
where everyone is going to go
yeah
where everyone chills out and laughs at whats happening on earth
hopefully
who knows
prob whats going to happen :///
nah we're all at least decent people
so long as its not based on religious following i genuinely believe none of us would be sent to a theoretical hell
the only ppl getting into heaven chrisitan norms are like white collar christians
why tf would god create us just to suck his theoretical dick???
god is just zeus
dun rermember
they also put ppl in a metal bull to tourcehr them
very sexual in nature
oh yeah
and then they made a minator
wait yes
i thought minotaur was from poseidon fucking a bull
god of wine
born of queen pasiphae's god-inflicted infatuation with a bull, the minotaur was eventually killed by theseus.
you can prolly guess all of them so i wont bother saying
then you play as zegreus who is hades' son trying to escape hell
i don't remember
yeah
interesting
ilove every aspect of all of the games
i like how we go from gods to video games
... 21st century am i rite???? **laugh track**
not the studio's projects
soft drink machine that dispenses endless shrimp
‚Äúyour sword is your boyfriend‚Äù
yeah
yeah
||i was just like "whats happening waitnononono"||
||just like tell her to produce a book describing all of her memories||
"now that's funny because it's very cruel and humiliating"
this episode is so :)
she could also do the whole call for ubi further spreading its importance
welp, bernie's got a real good shot
i would've went with klobachar if i were a moderate
klobachar?
bloomberg was a funny candidate
he spent 500mil to steal a few votes from biden
would it work
so itd stay inside the balloon despite the hole at the bottom
pop a lil hole in the top
you pull some of the helium into a lil balloon and hold it down
hot air
boom
also easier control
im starting to not hate whatshername
shes still annoying
hes there
dude i feel that saying yes even though you don't remember thing
dang
its so annoying how much of carricatures whatshername and especially jason are
way better with his outfit
||theyre gonna get to go because eleanor said she failed so judge will be like "wow you are good people fuck the rules"||

at that one place near where we found spiderman that has the rocket ship outside of it
they want to disband the club
so we can literally take it over as being its eboard
sapra?
and anime lovers
they don't have rights to every game
however sarpa will fight that
wait
we just broke the first rule
like
since your informing the public
yeah but public knowledge is how you can get out
but a club where you get the shit beaten out of you
do i finish coding hw than gym
or gym than hw
and ive also got calc to do
my brain would be fried rn if i didnt have the algebra object from the start of the semester to go off of
this lecture question is frying my brain
ill just fiddle with what they gave us until it works
me too
but still
i can just do a for loop
you got the 1.0?
got it
so maybe it gets repaired and somehow does stuff?
am i the only one struggling with this lq?
anyone wana go to the su after i take a shower
you can
it's fine
i know üòî
i feel bad for how much jim and pam ar ebullying dwight but also
so til that mindflayers are a cool concept in dnd
baulders gate looks cool.
theres storms which are too cold to handle but ultimately they dont kill anyone
baldurs*
which is terrifying considering they are larger than buildings
toy story 1 the game
toy story 2 the game
ya got me there
you're looking real stupid right about now
fun fact
nice
its gonna be great
i just want skate 4 ;.; is that so much to ask for ea?
o well
::: concatenates lists
well your function returns a list
and fucks up everything
put return
it doesnt seem to be able to help me
i hate cse for making me so scared to help my friends
no worries
yeah same
like if you dont complete an lq on time he's not on your ass about it
as long as you do it
i mean
its been quite a while
its just so good
and the payoff was amazing
whats another game
mario
_name_ it
that one game
no i don‚Äôt
yeah
oh i have one
wheres waldo
how does a gabriel's horn have finite volume yet infinite surface area?
its an infinitely long solid funnel essentially
technically
yeah
i know
yeah
i like those shapes that like
it does
i only learned about klein bottles recently
its basically 1 side because the bottle extends its surface area through itself
or any hollow shape
yeah a bottle does too
thats any smooth hollow shape
informally, it is a one-sided surface which, if traveled upon, could be followed back to the point of origin while flipping the traveler upside down.
-wikipedia
also with integral of sec^3(x) is that the same deal as that stupid infinite sum of whatever equaling 1/2
you end up with infinite sec^3(x)
when you do it partwise you end up with enough integral of sec^3
is that integration by parts?
even in the video theyre like "yeah heres the integral you can do the work by yoursefl"
i dont know
theres no other way to do it i dont think
if that doesnt work then idk lol
but idk
its already trig
like when you have ssin^5x * cos^4xdx
fair
the extra credit isn't as hard as i expected it to be
theres no tan for du to work with in the problem
this math is frying my brain
i just dont know what the output and inputs are
it gives you tests
it does
basically you plug in the values instead of doing weird algebra
then
look at the ratios
then you derive the ratios using trigonometry
so you know what the entire value of the square root is
substitution lol
how do you know what to substitute where and where does everything go how does any of it work
then you put the a value on either the hypotenuse or the bottom
ok but how the fuck do you apply this for the substitution that was what i was asking
well its a trig sub
sorry i realized i explained this in a really shitty way
i just
its just another method of doing things
i just realized
i need to relieve some stress
right
youre explaining fine i just dont get it
yeah but how much %of the punch was everclear
not enough
and you were drinking so slowly too
why the hell did you say you drank less than me
cause i did

jake probably had 3-5
i still need to have a night where i drink atleast 5 shots
you're free

you can go for mushrooms
normal sauce or marinara?
3155 delaware ave
niagara can be done too
idk any of them.
i'll i know is that the only ppl left on dnc is biden warren and burnie
tulsi's still in
minus the people who are all like
should i spend an extra 6 for the garlic twists?
niagara isnt taking online orders rn
delaware isnt so far
can you call niagara?
both transit and delaware have notably better ratings than niagara and main too
thanks
i‚Äôd lean towards no
alright
who tf wants biden.
i was gonna do 7:30 if that works for you
ill head there in an hour
i feelbit was an attempt to heavily swayed by people who feed off dying ppl
too*
but also im hoping to find garlic knots that arent shit
you can't help everyone in a class society.
one side is suffering more than the other
they dont deserve my respect let alone my time or defense
i still have more
if you need the possibility of making billions to be motivated to do something you are genuinely a fucking pathetic and sad person
no just taxing more
for oil
he has policies and plans published showing what he'll do with the taxes
also stop giving control to medical companies who charge exorbitantly high prices for needed medicine
love capitalism
thanks
but i think i need ti register where i live
true
do any of you guys watch ludwig?
and what file is it getting it from?
probably 7:15
is there anywhere i can grab drinks with meal swipes?
i‚Äôm a little low on dining atm
ill just buy you one when we get back i guess
neolibs explaining trickle down economics
funny

i laugh
these socks i have signify which foot they go on and i
didnt realize socks were for a specific foot
i keep using python stuff for js
heading down to roosevelt rn
minimum wage increase is mainly an issue for startups
ubi in the time we're in would just result in everything costing more to take advantage of it
its a good idea but not for the present
not in competative markets
depends
competition doesnt prevent prices from going up
yeah thats caused by inflation
but that causes a slight increase in product prices
housing industry would become competative cuz people would have money to move
absolute political theater
ill eat it i guess but ill be discontent during
legit an amazing scene
quantum mechanics dont upset me
but i understand
this isnt even a bit i legitimately am furious that schrodinger's cat is so common as an attempted analogy for quantum mechanics
speaking of cats
or is it??
don't know till we observe it
exactly emil thats why i cant stand the analogy
the cat is either dead or alive
the godfather cat is dead or alive
it is impossible for it to be neither or both
^at least anthony gets it
well its at a state of where its both dead and alive until you check
bruh
its both dead and alivr
the cat is an observer itself though
correct
the cat may observe its fate
also does touching the cat without looking at it apply?
schrodinger's weed
schrodinger's box movement
the cat inside the box isnt moving
you know that as a result of your observation
why do i have 3 seperate jaden reaction images
what if we live in a simulation
thats reincarnation but lame
your not observing it
your observing this one
when would you die???
is the only pure form the second  you're born
i see no reason to consider that as a possibility
which it in itself would be nuts
shrodinger's wave theory states that any partical disepated in a semi predictable way i think. and until you observe it. its finite.
graph 1/x from 1 to infinity
then you spin it around the x axis
so its an infinitely long funnel that gets infinitely smaller
i'm goin to bed my brain hurtie from thinky to mutchy
yeah thats fair
ok yeah polsci teacher doesnt know if we chear
oh double score
its so hot in this classroom...
its so nice out again

aight u good. also we will get the hypothesis laws right?
they took down all the cow from dora posters :*
what‚Äôs a cow from dora poster
nice
yeah... drank...
what are hypothesis laws?
have you figured out what youll do for your double major?
that makes sense
at least youll have some wacky stories to tell
also the work lawyers do is absurd i could fucking never
yeah everyone deserves a defense
did you land premo
not yet
wheels up
like you know how i did the truck stand
the metal under side
up the hill
it wasn't terrible
what the fuck the real expressions library is gross
why the fuck cant we have variables in genetic whatever
this is impossibl
i hate when people say gooey
thats unfortunatados
what the fuck did youtube just spew out from its bowls
lq is actually pretty easy
yeah it is

thinkin bout buying some oj and mixing it to make a screwdriver
well i shouldnt say that
its up to you

but like idk what.
i meant like we can make a plan but its fine to not stick to entirely
i'm down for anything i'm open as long as i'm hanging out with you guys ya know.
yeah hes been a drog
does this not shatter an entire dimension of your existing reality?
and played the card game
its really just a fucking game to them
not ready for it to be over
or is it the infinite hiatus
is the original series technically over? i forget
the og series ended
its just og was supposed to have 6 seasons
anyone wanna eat somewhere sometime?
i have to like shower but then maybe
the one lady who he hooked up with early on in the series
ohhhhhh yeah
i imagine after that gay episode they got a lot of people saying "hey maybe you shouldnt start your episode by repeatedly saying fag"
i don‚Äôt remember but i wouldnt be surprised
could be something like fucker i guess but iirc right it wouldnt quite fit
dwight is really the epitome of "that guy you dont really hate but would really appreciate not being around"
"you really need to learn more about your culture" fuckin got me
mexican lemonade
why does everyone always look on the verge of tears
he‚Äôs-a allergic to-a spaghetti
you‚Äôd know
there was the bachelor party last episode
not that we even will get it
that‚Äôs true
in 316 and theres two members of college repubs in here and listening to them is interesting
those tests are stupid
how the hell do you test this lecture question
i feel smart doing this
i went to a ta and they looked at my code and said ‚Äúyou have too much code‚Äù and left ;.;
we need leafyishere to comeback from the dead and roast joe biden
so idk what to do now
like
i just had a bunch of functions feeding into each other
that‚Äôs what i did
i mean because if the way i wrote the code
look at all the other slides those list functions are super useful
its crazy
holy shit
fuck
why?
i really want school to not close
where did you hear it
y‚Äôall we can‚Äôt closeeeeeee
its possible i might be able to stay with my sister here after next week so maybe we can do stuff adam idk
traveling home on the train is gunna be fun :vvvvv
you see where i'm going with this
the lirr isn't!
okay guys but like i have to drive all the way home by myself
saturday at 1
ive taken amtrack here three times before
stop
8 hours ;.;
i've done 3
that would have been the cost for a one way ticket
fair
that‚Äôs so expensive
that sounded super passive aggressive my bad
no ik it is but its the only way
this is bout to be me at you guys
anyone wanna grab dinner in a few?
so i need a break
am also tired
no one got it
i fucked up the quote anyways
<:jermajup3:511340248085823488> <:jermajup4:511340248823889927>
my brains still got some growin to do
hey emil
how?
thats how you get his force upwards.
so if the list is like [1,2,3,4,5] and you give it 2,5 it's gonna return 7/2
patrick that's really good
congrats
it doesnt include the endpoints
yeah
so functionname(list(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0)) returns a function then you give that function the parameters (2.0, 5.0)
yeahhh
my grandma went to some agent since i wasnt on my mom or dad's taxes the past 2 years
7/2 = 3 in scalaworld
yeah
we all float on ok
i blame python
python spoil u?
well you can do it in scala too, just in scala it converts non-int ratios to ints, whereas python changes to a float.
i give up idk whats wrong with my code
and also ‰∏≠ÊñáÂæàÈöæ
list(2.0, 1.5, 8.1, 4.0, 9.0, 4.1, 2.2, 7.0, 3.6, 2.2, 4.5, 7.5)
i thought you'd find the average between two points
indices are ints
no comment
so i take it we're doing nothing?
although maybe we should do something thursday?
i‚Äôm uncomfortable
thats fine
how did i do dat
don't want anyone left out or feeling weird ya know.
ofc i'm not gunna be a dick and just start drinking lol
(now the real question is... wtf do i do with the vodka lmao.)
bruh
wym??
without a reason
what happened? you wanna talk abt it?
super tuesday 2 and the school potentially shutting down
the fearmongering around corona has started to get to me a bit too
so super tuesday 2
sorry i shouldnt get so heavy
makes things sound way worse than they are
its gunna be fine.
i wish i had more fruit by the foots

thank you
$chan x
$chan x
$chan b
we get creepy images
$chan x
$chan x
we've got this
well yang just endorsed biden...
$chan ic
$chan x
$chan x
$chan x
maybe the dnc kidnapped him
its like if tulsi went and endorsed biden
i don't think he couldve been bribed, yang seemed super honest
although then you end up with warren scenarios
im not opposed to biden's death but i dont think thats the plan
he got a vp offer from bloomberg and didnt endorse him
and i dont see at all why biden would pick yang for vp
he wouldnt spread all these great anti-establishment ideas for nothing
i don't get it
also why hasn't tulsi dropped out to support bernie?
he is gonna be manipulated by the establishment
he inspired me
thats why i couldnt really get myself to like him in all honesty
he does explain it
when else?
it was his site with the detailed explanations
im not talking abiut you specifically as an individual
then i simply watched him talk about stuff already knowing the explanation by reference
people are nowhere near as informed as you think they are
that too
yeah that was dumb
yang supporters need to think for themselves
i dont blame these people for getting fooled either
yang clearly betraying himself by endorsing biden
(or the dem nominee, which biden isnt yet)
he has many great ideas
i think what he did diminishes it tho
i think we gotta seperate the message from the man
the replies are
it wasn't
and departed from yang
maybe start our own internet group
not a huge fan of that name
it sounds pretentious
im just blown away at how
wow
this take is
he is arguing against yang
this is actually a yin and yang situation wow
no this person is defending yang
and are continuing to do so
fucking christ finally jim and pam are dating
the are like loyal little pets
sorry for the language just saw bernies polling data

that‚Äôs cool
i just want to make sure if i stay that i have friends here
im not staying

me neither
hope you can make it anthony! if you can't its fine, your job on the board comes first man :p
depending on how labs are handled if they're not needed in person i'm leaving.
i hope to find this out soon
so uh what time tonight
not 9
bc like physics
is gay
in my dream i bought fruit by the foots
i want them back
lol.
finally
i've always wanted to know more after the class of '76
no its new
scp-4833 is a group of reality benders that alter the past through music
yeah i might go
yes lol
at least in my case
me too
cool
that was from earlier ignore that
physics office hours has saved my life
i might be a bit late if we're meeting then
i really b out here falling asleep in physics
i need a red bull
i would but im a bit busy rn
so yea..
i mean i thought it was at 9 so
sorry
so then we can get everyone.
yeah
i'm gonna quarentine myself in my nuclear bunker.  gonna game, study, and occasionally party.
whats the plan
no fucking clie
perhaps you'd like a doctor
and shit?
most of the population will have been infected in that timespan
in which the outbreak peaks within the next 2-3 months, dissipates over summer, and then comes back with a vengeance in the fall
given that its a virus and people will probably be idiots in leaving quarantine, i'm in favor of this expectation
here's an interview from politico with dr. anthony fauci, director of the niaid since 1984

after my lab
‚¨ÜÔ∏è  dylan joins

i feel bad for patrick if there's someone in the chat who he's not comfortable with, just because i know how i'd feel in the same situation
we are a private for profit board so if you want to vote anonymously just dm me
wait so you take bribes?
also the board doesn't accept bribes
we still dont have votes
vote: dylan joins ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  dylan pends joining ‚¨áÔ∏è
i call for order
yessir
my only real argument is that the way he acts and the things he says make me genuinely not comfortable
anyone wana chill at su
i would also like that
by too long i mean several hours
and mayb tom
and go at like
5:30?
get the best l00t there

aggh
i think we have enough people to do expert without any real problems
ive never played expert
i ment hard mode bc i'm retarded
jake ive played the game
wings and shit
no clue. i think sometime this year???
ya know... i haven't done a yoyo run yet.
i've done sword
summoner is super fun
bee staff is great
whixh gives bees
the bee boss i great to farm
easy and the rewards are great
especially for honey
i went into hard mode before getting ??? orange ore inforgot
orange?
palladium is the only other orange ore and thats hardmode only
adamantium is red but also a demon altar ore
its molten whixh does come from hellstone
and we were like well lets just kill it now
and than we got our asses handed to us by pirates
oh my
oh...

dylan
also. why is mercedes a basic bitch
have you heard of the tragedy of duscur
no lol
what am i suppose to dooo000
good enough
bruh 3 confirmed cases in erie county
what
there have been 2 confirmed cases in monroe county (rochester area)
or do gremory
your choice though you play the game how you want
after the obvious rigging in iowa, i would not be suprised if they are rigging it everywhere
oml i can get sylvians help to kill his own brother
do it
oh its ok i did too
oh nice special dialogue
wtf i just got cathrine for nothing???
nice
no like i recruited her
the dlc character with the trickster class at base (yuri) uses it really well because he has an equippable relic that gives him +1 mov, chance to halve all damage, and canto (the horse/flying move after doing thing ability)
yuri in general is godly
the dlc campaign is so good
its hard though
no lq?
is back on the menu for me
wacky
i mean to be honest that‚Äôs probably what‚Äôs happening in nyc atm
weather update i probably will be living at home
cuomo wants to use suny dorms as hospital/quarantine space apparently
i mean i understand
things are gonna start getting weird everywhere
they‚Äôll probably still house you
ugh ive got so much homework to do this week
i‚Äôm just asking because i have a flight ticket
because if i go to ub, i want people to be there
which is fair for both of you
ubnl is still going
if this was to spread out of control in erie would you rather be stuck in a dorm by yourself. or with someone who can provide for you.
like this is a worst case senario
so do i
we gotta get it prob by the end of the semester
i did just refund my ticket ;.;
we've still got discord
but you know what i mean
and i‚Äôm really not sure
patrick and adam, you guys said you‚Äôll be there, right?
i decided im going back
everything is just so uncertain and i'm really not vibing with it rn
exactly
oh right thats happening right now
terrifying
they are entirely gloves off
also biden was acting like he was this huge factor in helping gay people
he said a woman
so probably warren or copmala
ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
its be great if there was at least 1 episode of steven universe future that wasnt super uncomfortable
really shoulda been 3 songs on the album
i like this last part the most btw
last part slaps
but like i'd expect one class at least to msg me in this time.
classes are just online how the teachers want to do it
ik but i want to know what to do.
how corporate
peak comedy
my nose is running eyes watering all because of my resistance wearing off
my friend cracked his head open the other day...
so it was broken
it hit him square in the head.
i was about to be like "what the fuck was the mental process behind this"
it wasn't a deep wound. we didn't go to the hospital
we went back to his place and washed the wond and told to sit up and put pressure on it.
the bleeding stopped
why?
schlip
i mean obviously it wouldnt just go through the skull but still it couldve cause some damage were it to hit it directly
just saw notorious - it was great!
sounds cool, i‚Äôll give it a go!
same
sure thing
thnx i don't think its much new info on what we already don't know
youre probably right?
i will
rip linksat, which was supposed to be finished this year
also, i think i'm the only one in this webex seminar
they recently shut down all casual lab work
lolllll
fucking honors system
sbu kicked everyone off campus the other day
or imma be maad
also that
yeah
they probably spent all the money on that dumbass cafe in capen
hype
housing refunds are on their way
so like
i gott ask this shit with my parents,
patrick imma be honest thats a pretty bad idea imo
and i feel more secure getting it in buffalo where i can't infect my grandparents
up to them
thats not what im worried about
i appreciate that
legoshi
basically
cant think of any other female politicians id want as vp
she is almost a progressive
oh i've seen this
seems im not going back to campus

i mean you have your computer so thats kind of a silly question
i can download it rn
üÜóüÜí
i might do that

this shit is wack
ok mr. buffalo resident
uhhh
no that's why im asking you guys
alright good
i'd already know who to blame if i got the email
it's not too bad
im just worried im cheating it without realizing
how so?
i mean you already know that
don't get it
what i just posted
well
if i die i die
too strong for that
reassuring
i'm already gettin cabin fever
oh my god
and i don't think joes got a fucking medicare plan
at least youve got friends there and shit
i foolishly stayed inside for 4 days
i have nothing to do but be inside
anyone down for terraria any time soon?
yessir
and if it doesnt work ill get a refund
my cousin plays it on his 2011 macbook air
ok i bought it
its a 32 bit game
i am ready to game
im halfway through this dungeon gimme a bit
yo lemme add yall on steam
friend code: 143907425
here's a quick link for anyone else
hi back
i'm adam
thank you thank you
i'd give you one if i could
i can just wait till after you finish
alright
i'm back
its byte for me
doesnt matter for me even if i could go out theres nothing to do here
you went home?
had to
no one can
democrats: low interest loans
republicans: direct cash payments
so question
you can request your classes to be pass/fail apparently
so low pressure this semester which is nice at least
alright so considering my current gpa i should pass/fail any courses that are a- are lower since they would only lower or make it harder to increase my gpa
we should try to make our schedules for next semester line up in terms of free time
that's probably smart
i was thinking maybe trying to keep fridays free but idk how well/possible that would be
at least you dont have my mondays
~~albeit i ended up just skipping all my calc and 116 classes but shhh~~
i just geometrically broke down that a person would lose contact with a frictionless hemisphere at cos(2/3)
pls kill me. this question took way too long
do you mean arccos?
conservation of energy
we would lose energy
ei=ef+ff
but whats the point of doing stuff that cant apply to the real world
its harder to do friction but is there any way in which friction wouldnt apply in the real world
when will discord give us the ability to write formulas ;.;
at least i got theta in there
and just copy and pasted it to see if it would work
this is the definition of low quality but high effort.
animal crossing is great
cool
i'm tempted to buy switch lite
its a $200 price difference at this point
thats a lot of money
that does seem cool...
what i like is that i don't have to wait a day if i found a tree was constantly in my way.
i can just down a fruit and move it
yeah i have it
i think i'm going to have to redo my genetic algorithm üòî
it requires a surprisingly large amount of accuracy for some of the tests, at least with how i approached it
did anyone else start working on it yet?
when does school start up?
anyone thinkin about requesting 191 to be pass/fail?
cause i'm not gonna do well
but i think i just solved the bonus hw
i havent started either yet lol
the one she suggested?
ill show you my code once you finish
yeah
dammit 191 is using the lockdown browser for quizzes
makes sense
if anyone wants to get together tomorrow or something to do hw3 i‚Äôm down
the hw is due wednesday
its ez tho
hw 3?
gotta finish it at least
but it isnt too abd
they really had to schedule labs??
so you have to insert it into the def generate_powerset functuon?
what
anthony you have to make that function
also i thought it was a list of doubles we wanted not ints
yeah
use nook miles tiitckets
i went to like 3 islands to get iron lol
i have some iron you can have i guess
i need 6 more
you're gonna need more iron in a bit too
like 13 more or so
not until tomorrow though
i've been throught 5 islands
and i still don't have enough iron
if you havent yet talk to your villagers one should give you 5 iron
i just bought new horizons
i have cherries, oranges, and pears (also coconuts but those are easy) on my island atm and i can also get peaches and apples from some other friends if you guys need any of those
the orange and pear trees are still growing thoguh
just missing jake it seems
piazza
fuck
<:bruh:688130959635513356>
191 can be pass fail for me
phew
im just so fucking relieved for calc 2
i think ill keep my calc 2, and just p/f 191
ugh why couldnt my body have waited until i was home to get sick
im absolutely not keeping calc 2
oh found it
that's 191 for ya
for reference on how to complete it
that or im fucking stupid
the later is likely
where's the calculator expansion when i need it
yeah now you have time
is this a 116 think my small 115 brain is not allowed to know ;.;
!brain
you‚Äôre the key to space travel
wreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhwrrrrr
~~the sequels are the only star wars movies ive actively watched (also rogue one)~~
like they were a dot compared to that ship they destroyed there
ok what do you want to assume the mass of the starship is
several trillion tons
i'm going to assume 70,000,000 kg
i'd estimate about 20 grams
3,145,800,000,000,000,000,000,000
of energy
bc space
these are the dimensions of the ship that went light speed (but we dont know the density)
this is the ship it rammed into
shit in star wars is so damn big
robert busch
shit i really need to do my hw3
they're due on friday
feelin better about 191 now
sets make sense to me
can we use the lectures for it?
oh thank god
anyone wanna get on call in a bit to work on hw3
same i've been stuck on this for an hour already
good question emil
emil im lazy
gotcha
<:bruh:688130959635513356>
i mean i have no doubts that you two can get it done, but damn
best of luck
that's everything
it‚Äôs
if we do then i understand
it's not like we wont have the resources we need to figure out how to do it
right now it seems impossible because we're stupid idiot babies
still don‚Äôt want to
or rather, to pass
i also would like you to pass patrick
that was very heartwarming from the both of you
we all got shit patterns and i have the closest thing to a good price out of us all lol
i still cant figure out that one stupid fucking lecture question
nope
u1lq5?
that's even worse
i'm gonna hop in vc to work on hw3
wdym its easier
yeah just gimme a sec
ill be on in a sec
page 130
this is where to ta linked in piazza for p10
for problem 10 do you use the datasets from 9 or just make up your own
it‚Äôs like a general one
also adam you were right about 9d on the 191 hw
idk how to prove it without creating an example dataset
emil which one are you talking about
the one where you take the length of not a
he is most likely talking about 10
oh yeah length of not a is 16
so the length of |u| - |a| is 12
so the cardinality of not a is 16
ohhhh
i think its just formatted weirdly with the bar also being over the ||
wait now im confused again
yeah
but {red blue purple green} or {red blue purple green} is just itself
yeah
wait so you got 16
that‚Äôs what i had originally
all i have left is 8d and 10b
then i‚Äôm done
nice
yeah
b4 quarentine i was walking 10 miles a day, now i'm walking a little over a mile a day.
if anyone is interested in frostpunk its $33 on steam right now for the version that also has all the dlc
yea i don't think i will cause we literally have videos on it already
i gotta do the video today
oh jeez really don't like monday's lq
anyone get yesterday's lq?
i have a hint: there‚Äôs one small edge case you‚Äôre missing
i remember hearing about it but don't remember it exactly
its so fucking pretty holy fucking christ
also apparently they announced a new smash character
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bravely default 2 demo available now holy fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkk
bruh
not fair though look what europe gets
just watch the first 10 seconds or so
okay i got it i schedule it b4 friday then next week we talk about hw verification and learning objective over zoom
i much prefer tailend recursion to regular recursion
true true
yeah
if you guys cant handle that how the hell am i supposed to do it
my guy really rushed me
check your emails and schedule?
we all need to do it im p sure
the project isnt due yet
i still need to figure out how to make up the first objective
its verification for the objective so uhhhhh???
im p sure it is for the project
just because i think they do that in the 15 minute zoom meeting too
wdym
how do you not know lol
not the 2 hour thing
what
no those are the labs
what else would be verified
smh emil forgetting im cripplingly inept
heck we can get in a call rn
yeah i did the lab
it‚Äôs not too hard
i put too much effort into these
i explain what the idea is, then define a function that uses the idea and walk the reader through it
not main method
bravely default 2 is just avatar the rpg
all of the demos for all three games so far have been garbage despite the games being amazing
i just want portal
laidlaw's story is out the window now
what happens now... is up to valve.
idk anything about half life
ok want a quick run through bc i'll happily explain the story so far.
sorry
oh also i'd like to play the half life series at some point, so lmk if there's a steam sale for that
they‚Äôre almost always on sale
also emil there‚Äôs a mod that makes them co-op
modding on a mac
also portal 2 has a co op mode
it was fun for a while
the vault lvl?
on what, alyx?
*emil
holy crap discord ligit said no to my msg
it‚Äôs called synergy
i wasn't supposed to read that lol
hl1 doesn‚Äôt have a lot of plot
its a lot of txt
its great
you can buy as many cats as youd like
you ever buy things with love?
only problem is that there's no way to turn off ads (not even a purchase option :()
||aperature really likes teleportation technology huh||
thanks for the warning
8 fucking games
that sure is the number 8
and like 5
oh wow
i cont dlc as spererate games tho
i can't afford a vive
i used a vr once in middle school since a teacher brought it in
i loved black mesa tho
even tho it was a lil buggy they made hl1 so mutch fun with black mesa
boy if it‚Äôs kitten crossing or whatever
bc that does have a good story
undertale is a mastapeece
skyrim
those are the biggies i think
i have 174 games on steam im epic
my choixe for halo
that‚Äôs pretty epic patrick
i've already played halo
cause the vehicles
thats good!
on occasion
i hate class online. i just get distracted with home projects and games
i wanna be back so bad i miss you guys :(
yeah, i wish i were back in ub too
someone help me with the tophat
its a test run of quiz 3
just to check that all the software works
we love to see it
???? then why this code make smaller number then suppose to be :c
hmmm
val pi: double = math.pi
that‚Äôs cool
i don‚Äôt like them
im doing my best ok
is this to try to punish us for not watching lectures?
if so holy fuck that's lame and such a waste of the time of whoever has to go in and delete the content
which slides?
it seems straightforward
f: {1, 2, 3, 4} --> n
f(n) = n+1
is the domain {1, 2, 3, 4} or {2, 3, 4, 5}
yeah
binary trees look cool
hmm thats a good point
i'm not sure
this is my math class atm
its a calc 142 quiz
wtfffff
id prefer not to look at it
im back inside
cool
you can def program that no problem
like thered be individual factors you customize in addition to the general simulation "type" (communities, isolation, central location, etc.) (isolation could probably be applied to any of the models though)
wouldn't isolation be just breaking up the simulation into separate simulations
itd be intensive on a computer
and probably slow
and whenever we want to infect an adjacent square it has a random opportunity to do so
but how would you program a radius, and what data structure would you use to represent the population
make a "person" class that has constructors for the location, give states (removed, susceptible, infected), etc.
like physics engine but if they moved by themselves
ohh ok i see
you dont need collision though, because people dont walk into each other lol
regardless youd still need direction for when they bounce off the inside of the box
you could set a random starting direction and program boundaries for collision?
well direction is still necesarry even if its random
the vectors for movement just need to update to a new position, but smoothly
this isnt hard by any means but theres still easier and less tedious possibilities
if i dont have any other ideas by the time it comes then sure
not student union
4 episodes tonight
i didnt do a recitation
just saw the slides on piazza
any1 know who it is?
sacrilege
also incorrect conjugation? lol
all is forgiven
what was it?
spoiler
for what
alyx
yeah
the cost is the direct distance to the point
not really im just tryin to spread the hype about hl3 bb
friday
i have an idea but that requires a lot of if statements
i was way overcomplicating it
it doesn't make me feel comfortable asking questions
nice
i really dont wanna do genetic algorithm
huh, it wasn't a problem with functionality
it found an error
genalgo isnt that difficult tbh, you should be able to get it
anyways
or i guess maybe you can idk
number of generations depends on your code, i recommend writing it with a small number and going up based on the level of accuracy you need
thats oop
i meant not allowing state as in we cant use variables
yeah
well immutability builds consistency within variables
its on the document
which link
no, the video about genalgo
where it says video
found it
half the class is going to fail out
thats pretty low
fucking momentum bullshit
:+ adds an item within the list youre referencing right
you can't append to immutable lists
check the methods he gave in the second to last lecture in fp
they're all really helpful
basically concatenates the element to a list, but creates a new list value in the process
but youd have to define it to a variable right
nil is like a list that isn't actually there right
i have absolutely no idea
what was that function where you put 2 values in and it returns the lower one
min(x, y)
yeah im gonna need a lot of generations
i have an idea for a shortcut though
there it is now i can freely super easily change the number of generations and the size of the population yay
ugh i cannot get close enough though
in my range function i swapped a + for a -
ugh i really dont wanna do my calc work
its actually fine
i got a 0
and i still cant figure out that one fucking lecture question so even if i did notice this before id still be completely fucked
the homework and classwork are seperate entities
just follow the instructions in the feedback
i gave you the reason
you gave an idea of the reason
but yeah the false alarm email said i hadnt scheduled an interview despite me having scheduled one for monday and getting an email from calendly saying its all good
complete and utter dread twice in a row is not the best feeling
mine is weed day
you should be able to see your date if you go to hub
who dat????
well i got my schedule. now i have to call ub fa tomorrow and hope i can get my tax forms in time
andrew hughes is good
god next semester is going to be a lot of math...
i like this schedule not too bad
my genetic algorithm works, but it doesn't pass the primary
usually you take 4 courses a semester, and you‚Äôre taking 5
i tested the single value, polynomial, and towers
i dunno
mine just did it
does it have to be super duper accurate?
yea mine isn't
it shoots real well tho
still needs to be within 0.05
mine runs 500 generations and is always within 0.0001
you could probably go up to 50k generations if you wanted
0.14921133554371804 was not less than 0.05
that is with 2000 generations
is it weird that my gui doesn‚Äôt operate well with a high population number (that‚Äôs needed for accurate results)
like 2 minutes
i‚Äôm just thinking about how they‚Äôll do the homework verification
normal
wow its decently accurate even within just 5 gens
oh genes
that's why i've been using 1
weird that it can't seem to get 1 value right
it‚Äôs 3 genes, because the output is a list of 3
and consistantly less than .2 error.  if more than 1 gene were required this shouldn't be possible
very clearly optimizing for (-7, 0, 0)
idk what was up with my testing
thanks!
yeah
100,000 took 1 minute
try 1 trillion
at least the way that i did it it should be linear
lemme look
hey we played it
i can't rn i'm playing rust with some other friends but maybe tomorrow
really got my $10 worth
that‚Äôs not fun
anyone wanna play csgo?
fun fact i just learned while reading my text for honors college: ubuntu is actually the xhosa (a south african tribe) word for humanity
that's pretty cool
it's based on some dude from /fit/ who only worked out his traps and ended up looking like a frog
fuck i really dont wanna have to do my interview today
oh we all are
but at least you understand what its about... idk any of the projects and such...
just suddenly got removed from a long time friend group for some reason ?? thats nice
bah whatever
i also am not comfortable doing a quiz in my own home
i should cheat just to keep my grade up
so we can ask general questions about the concepts of the subject.
(oh cool i can now be reported to academic integrity.)
office hours i at least feel a lil welcomed, and able to be attended to more quickly then these stupid zoom oh. because so many people use them now...
i still havent figured out an assignment from week 2 of the semester
man i wish i did a better job on physics...
the learning objective interview?
yeah
shit i also have a calc 2 exam
freedom of though is a very good thing, however question opposed by others could shake its foundation. this is how educated people refer to things as sound logic.  which makes sense. you don't want to be on a boat that
's made with holes.
why do they care so much about what you or i think about life
yeah but you dont need some jackass telling you you think wrong and then owning you with facts and logics to be able to change the way you think if your current way isn't right for you
someone thinking the world exists because x reason isn't gonna change whether or not people die of easily preventable illness or lack of basic resources
this is true, however a philosophy doesn't need to be a x reason as to why we exist. it can be a plan to establish something.)
establishing its claim to others.
alright
its funny
i like it when things are and want things to be simple yet i cant help myself from constant overthinking
also i apologize if i gloss over things that are important to you guys, i don't intend to do that
still dont really get how it works
did we discuss how snapping is just a smaller sharper claping.
snaping?
oh wait 343 m/s
i'm stupid
the way i did my lq's was gonna be different anyway
me neither
couldn't answer any of them
yeah
they give off that impression
i just feel dumb when they talk to me
or post about it in discord
but ik that ik my shit cuz i completed the lq's and project successfully
can my internet stop blipping on and off please
that sucks bro
god how do i phrase this email without being an entire ass
i really wanna roast these fools
but patrick was the only one i got a link to calendly from
there's a third patrick?
i feel like it is, but they could execute it a little friendlier
understand it really well
i understand fp and now they think i don't
the one verification form from last week seems to serve the purpose of everything that isnt the project i dont get why they bother with interviews and shit
i hope they let me screen share for my hw verification
just make sure your towers works
mine doesnt work at all
is there anything at all i need to change in any of the code?
lower the number of generations
also in your case, probably decrease the population
sometimes it does it at me but 80% of the time its random
you mean tower server?
i think it went alright
he was just like "sorry about yesterday i had thought all the interviews were last week"
nice
oh jeez i almost forgot to do this lq
this would be terrible if i didnt find a sneaky way to use another function
thanks
just have my verification interview in 3 hours and i can finally stop worrying (for this week)
i haven't looked no, do you wanna get in call and work on it friday or smth?
also next quiz we can def just get in a call and not join the meeting
but overall, much better than before
cuz the default zoom page says enable mic, share screen, invite people
nah trust me monday's lq is super easy
we still have them, but at an annoying time
because 90% of the time mine just does nothing
hm i have one idea i havent done before
oh wait i did try that
this tower aims slightly behind where i'm moving
it aims right but the algorithm takes a moment to calculate the aim
i didn‚Äôt uh
yeah i noticed that lol
also i'm really confused, the lq is literally already written for us in the code lol
wait uhhhh
uhhhhhhh
okay
cool
im so fucked
which was the same with me
but if thats the case, it seems like you did well
good job üëç
my ta is generally very relaxed which makes it less stressful
anyone wanna do the lab at 6pm today
must be nice, i have a calc2 test tomorrow üò¶
oh shit i probably missed another recitation quiz
oh and a 9am quiz friday
aint that nice
ughh
but my guy emailed me 2 minutes in and reminded me
so i made it
yeah he saved my ass
i mean it‚Äôs not very long though is it?
he understood that the gui was bad
eyyyy we can
yeah it just looks funny
you know what you're not wrong
i feel like mine was generically coded
we should have a code discussion party
im so down
yeah but discord screenshare is ass
pft, caring about online security, what a dweeb
they're getting sued rn over selling private data to facebook
lmao
so apparently that will be one of the projects
well done
time to go to the coronavirus sim
using graphs
oh shoot
probably graded by last name, so maybe they'll verify your grade tomorrow?
i wouldn't call k "early"
first half
that
my last name first initial must therefore be categorized as "in the middle"
not early
but not first third ü§î
why is 1/3 any more practical
why am i doing this when i could be studying for my calc test
which lq is that
but i don‚Äôt know how to do it
when you guys are done with it i have to show you it is too fucking good
friday was evaluate an expression tree
yeah that one is hard to give hints for
this is in the slides so i can send it
and it took me like 10 minutes
its just stupid
because yikes
i just dont like hard things
wait do you mean 191 hw or 116 hw
yeah the 116
they just posted it today and it's due in like 10 days
yesss got the lq babeyyyy
alright now i have to show you my code for it
do it
correct
<:hacliffe:683885354171891743>
i exist as your antithesis adam
but i can't if all i'm imputing to the function is the writer
aren't you storing things in a dictionary
its the writer obj
what is static and dynamic typing
that sorta functionality would help me so much in the past
in basically every language
no not like that
because then you'd want each value to exist outside it's own stack frame
but what if you need them for later use outside of the for loop
yeah ik but when you dont have mutability you cant do that
you can use for loops in immutable structures though
ex: val datastructure: list[int] = (for (i <- range(0, 5)) yield { i +2 }).tolist
why would you want to use that
it has write header in it :c
what does?
that was dumb
python is the language that makes things really easy to run right out of the box, but then you have to memorize all the built-in functions
saves a lot of time though
wait the 116 homework is posted?
i'm quite surprised, i never thought that would happen
yeah
is that the one you guys are looking at
yeah
i feel like wednesday's lecture question can tie into that
you could represent each grid space in the maze on a map
mine is gonna be absurdly slow already i can tell
probably
yeah honestly
real desperate yet not enough to stop being homophobic
fuck that just make it so everyone needs to be tested atleast a year prior to donating or test people prior to donating
is anyone else having problems with the gui for shortest paths?
okay
now it‚Äôs throwing errors when i run it
ill be a bit late i gotta eat dinner in a bit
do you have to pass the calc 2 final
the common final?
depends on your class's syllabus
gotcha
so i couldnt cheat
you will at least get not that
idk what i have in polsci rn
cagliostro isnt even considered the best part
i didn't realize how bad my 191 grade is
wait i think my 191 ec wasn't graded because i didn't put my name and ubit
did anyone get their first ec in autolab yet?
did you not?
noooooooo
that sounds good
how is it?
is your guys' hw3 graded?
not yet
lets finish it up tomorrow i dont wanna do more work today
lol sounds like a plan
does anyone here know how to do problem 5 on hw4? i could use some help without revealing the answer
oh shit me too
the recent lecture questions have been easier imo
in the mazepath thing is the list[gridlocation] supposed to include the starting location
i think i figured out how
nice
veeeery slow as expected
yeah wow  this is really inneficient
like so wrong i cannot begin to comprehend why
make it work
also i had the same name for 2 item things with nested for loops lol
it works
at least for the small maze
its speed exponentially lengthens because of how i did it
hm gives an error every time the server actually works
not doing what its supposed to though
im so close i just need the movement to be right now
ooooo come on now
now it works but the "player" vibrates
is anyone available to work on the remainder of 191 at 3:00?
well it is finally 3:30
what does it mean?
okay
thanks
damn
quarentine in a nutshell
i'm vibin
they are very fluffy
i'm still waiting for jesse to unmute himself
he's not muted
lmao
b0red
i also just hate reading the fucking book in philosophy, and it not having any lectures
not a big deal, i just saw that an instructor responded to my post
logic does not apply in physics curriculum
so im gunna stop for my health
the syntax is a bit jumbled weird for me though
i mean its an hour for 4 questions there should be no difficulty cheating
kinda nostalgic too
so i got bored and started looking up case fan wiring because i actually have 6 casefans
nor wiring kid
that's a thing?
i think exams are 20% of my grade? but i forgot
why is 115 still in my ublearns
i wanna make bad decisions
idk which ones but my brain is telling me to make bad decisions

i should sleep
its for hammer
yooo
how's hammer goin?
i slept, still wanna make bad decisions
anything specific?
it's easy
what does it mean for a class to track something
context: metagame is an upcoming netflix original that is a sequel to the smash brothers
that clip is an unused scene from metagame
sometimes it works...
sometimes its just like...
i dont like actors this is weird
i thought so
its private
ahhh
im bored someone come to my ac town
flicks at my town rn
does anyone want to start working on the 191 homework today, so we can do like 2 problems a day and get it done early?
i feel like after watching the video i was unsure about actors, but now that i completed the lecture question its a lot clearer
i sorta get the possible application but just
idk it doesnt vibe with me
i am struggling a bit with decisiontree
tfw you think you have to use the parallell axel formula to get inertia for everything bc physics only gives you com point inertia formulas. but on the wiki there are so much more!
why would you want that to spin!?!?
this is kinda what i'm looking for...
oh wait
whats an axis
2(m(d/2)^2)+2(md^2)?
oh so a line
center of the rotation
yea...
also how the f do you get distance for the 2 opposite points???
sooo formula should be... 2(m(d/2)^2)+2(m(d+d/2)^2)^2
lemme draw it first
just a hypot for this
like that
2sqrt((d^2+(d/2)^2))
the distance of each line is sqrt(d^2+(d/2)^2)
oh..
yeah
hey patrick
i still haven't received a lecture from my teacher
i haven't even thought about hw5 yet
jk i am stuck on 4 cuz we never learned it
2. add sin/cos
it holds the value
its like a type
its just different
still missing 2 lq's in ds
yeahhhhhh
and now the lecture question errored out and i don't know why
what don't you understand?
also
how do you open the animals.csv in the decision tree file
i did that
yeah
ok i think i might like decision tree a lot
yeah
and it is decision **tree**
i could do maze with how it wants us to but the gui doesn't run
i'll probably just do that
water is the best
i asked if the hw was gonna get extended
got a fat maybe
my ta
i pseudocoded some ideas in my head
idk why mine doesnt and i never got an answer on piazza
parasite just got added to hulu
from the image or other reasons
i shan't forgive you
i got the wrong output by mistake
nice
i have an idea of how to do it, but it would require using 34 classes
and i think that's just a tad much
without creating any new classes
i'll write tests tomorrow morning lol
crap, i have a chinese quiz i didn't study for
how is everyone
i don't like get how it stores data
you can
i enjoy data structures, but these homework's are difficult to pull off in a week
this is unfair as hell
thats what i did when we were assigned the project
i'm so close with decisiontree
i think
the adding to a tree is the hardest part üò¶
fair
because it's so much easier to visualize
yeah same
for lo
(also side note 191 grades are updates)
homework 3
we'll probably do better on homework 4
but also
we should work on homework 5
my priority rn is decision treee
fair enough
i'd like to create a contact tracing program within a graph of people to calculate the probability of certain people being infected
and lethality rate
yes indeed
do you have any project ideas?
i'm manually charting out a potential tree and i'm just gonna brute force it
this is great
kind of caught me off guard
i also easy drew my tree
its easy its just obnoxious
i‚Äôm going to use a tree
biden/kamala
i remember saying there was no way biden would win the primary
idk tho especially with how splut the democratic party is
exactly
wait it says he gets elected in 2045
also this means ben shapiro + steve crowder will be running in 2036.  good luck.
i think i have to use a tree
will i?
i use it automatically now
cool
something didn‚Äôt click
i guesses
i submitted
nope
i just dislike labs in general
too ‚Äúon the spot‚Äù
i have a function that i wrote that tells me the most efficient sides
lmao ok
i am kinda stressed
wait which learning objective
figured out why my lq was erroring
he didnt
please do that for me
im so gonna fuck up this interview
as long as my ta doesn't do that fill in the blank format, i'm good
linkedlist, trees, and graphs
how they work and what you would use them for
i just made functions for them
i love how theres no way to figure out why you arent getting the 1.0 on assignments
and yet
i just did what i was told to do
i was starting to like actors sorta then they hit us with this shit
im getting an absurd amount of errors for my test after it flickers a pass response
since you mentioned getting errors
someone on piazza has my same problem but what do you know they never got an answer
he doesnt say what to name the traders in the tradeagreement constructor
when you're making calls to classes, only use that call to compare
the one he gave you
basically if its a parameter, cool
or is it like
constructor contains the initial item
state variable is current item?
you're testing things that wouldn't exist in his code though i am 99% sure
same name
i have an idea gimme a sec
my idea worked
you got it!
ill dm you it
i couldve sworn i had tried that before but whatever
you can't call trader.olditem because olditem isnt a thing
i never did that
yeah i know but that was just a one time thing i tried i had tried without stuff like that in the past
well you did it on my own without my help then
good question | 2
i had to ask my question about the findpath method again simply because no one answered it
what
the question i just sent the screencap of
that one i need an answer to
101 views | 0 responses yiikes
that just means there's something in there taking too much time to compute
also we need to have our open ended objective decided upon what we do by next sunday which is delightful
the lab should help me for the interview
whats a bfs algorithm
what the fuck
it is confirmed the impossible üòÑ
how the fuck are you supposed to explain this in the time alloted
i got 122.0
i typed it out
and ran it
it‚Äôs just that my very last step was wrong, because i thought because compute returned 0.0 (for mine) that the whole thing would return 0
it‚Äôs something close to what you have
all the labs are done now its not possible for anyone to steal your answer so can you just say it now lol
i guess i can check?
got an answer but its just "make faster code" when that uh
isnt possible
fuck me it isnt working at all
theres too much to fucking process theres no way to reasonably make this uber efficient
the way i had to do this is so fucking absurd and backasswards but ill take it
itd have been so easy if i couldve made my own class
computer science is constant agony until momentary catharsis (which half of the time is false)
you'd be the best if you can figure that out.
if you download pycharm professional you can just make js files (with the code feedback and all)
otherwise you can check your code in another ide and just paste it into a file in the project you need
oh also i made my schedule
nice what is it
that‚Äôs so many psc classes üò∞
ooga booga sleep study party life time
you can make it now
what cse courses do i need to take
220 and 250?
huh.
i only put undergraduate for the checkboxes is that why
oh now theyre there ??
when is the advisement for this semester?
because he thinks it that difficult üò∞üò∞üò∞
my bad lol
converting a string to a list of tiles is still very clever though
i loved the idea behind maze i just wish one thing was different (one val being changed to a var) it wouldve been so much easier to optimize
my entire decision tree is in there
trump bucks
which is also at 5
logan
patrick iwazsko
hes very laidback which helps me not be so nervous
that was just because i misheard though
and then another part i entirely bullshitted and was right lol
wdym loop in binary trees
oh as in if you could go backwards?
it makes sense you would think graphs because graphs you do that
bc rn
i have 20 credits
ee202, cse191 cse116,phy108+lab+mth 142
yea its only offered in the fall
id probably push 191 back
push 191
although if you get 191 (which is math based) out of the way this semester, then wait on 116, 116 will be easy, you won't have to deal with 116 and 191 at the same time, and you'll properly prepare yourself for taking 220 right after
wait
really
although is 191 a prereq for 220?
i keep mixing them up lol
if you push one or the other i think i may actually recommend you get 191 over with?
idk what does everyone else think?
and take 191 next semester
i'm prob gunna see if i can talk to an adviser about this
what the fuck is this lq
but it doesnt seem too hard
with a graph you can, but there also aren't left and right nodes which makes it harder to program
lol i get what you mean
in your own testing?
autolab who knows
i have the perfect recursive algorithm to build the tree
but i can‚Äôt use a function that looks at all the true and false values that have been before it
but i can‚Äôt imagine how
which i haven‚Äôt tried yet
i could backtrack, but i also can‚Äôt do mode.left and node.right
im real worried about getting the 1 on this one
like it's just 115 type programming
unorganized
god forbid we even get a vidoeo
i'm prolly gonna complain about this in my course eval
yeah
same
pshh nope
i don't
that's what mine does
yeah exactly
idk how to
oh that's awkward
now you know
i sure do not want to watch the video
its due tomorrow night, we have some time
this lq is taking up too much of my spare time
i'm so fucked on decision tree
which video
decision tree
at least somewhat
really?
who are there peopl
so now i feel better about it and i'm waiting for oh
maybe
but there's always a makeup if i really fuck this up
patrick how long did it take you
there is a makeup right
like 15/20 minutes
clearly
you think i could get it done that quickly
i'm down
no harm in trying
is that just because it's returning null?
i asked the ta about if there would be a makeup
and she said she didn't know
jesse said there would be in his lecture i think
ahhhhhhhhhh
okay
check to make sure though
yeah lol
and theyre not coordinates theyre vectors
oh ok
think an arrow pointing off of an objects current location
it like adds both magnitudes together to determine the direction and distance
oh its a triangle
hypotenuse
my explanation was shitty sorry about that
which is weird
point is dont worry about z
top left is (0, 0)
so (2, 1) would be
so like list(
    list(maptile, maptile, maptile),
    list(maptile, maptile, maptile),
    **list**(maptile, maptile, **maptile**)
)
from what i've seen, if i create a graph of the map, i can just use the bfs algorithm i already made to run it
i imagine it shouldnt be too had to make a graph of
for whatever whatever item is stored in map and mapsto a list of all tiles 1 x or y away from it
i can't wait to see it
i always just go with the projects that my brain says are more mathematical/logic based
facts and logic moment
why is (0, 0) in the middle of the grid
that's its current velocity
its current velocity is (0, 0) so it doesnt move from that location
i was worried that i messed it up but i didn't, phew
when is the next office hour
oh rn in discord tom
and maybe physics lab :)
congrats
which doesn't seem to hard
lmao
so subtract the new location from current location that's the x and y for the physics vector
idk the docoument just said to do it
i'll figure it out sometime tomorrow though
where is the index thats out of bounds
it's possible that it was my getvelocity method because i'm almost certain i programmed it incorrectly so i just commented it out and replaced it with a (0, 0) velocity
yeah it was
i tried to do indexof( ) to get the tile position, but because it was a different object, it returned -1
i didn't know it was due tonight wtf
yeah
blue velvet is really good.
ebert gave it 1 star.
anyway, i really liked the movie
just study what you mised on that exam
nope i lied it just doesn't work
but you got the 1.0 lol
yeah he somehow didnt notice that when looking at my submission and the fact that the question was already resolved
error every time because it returns an **empty list**
i meant findpath()
i have not been scolded i reign supreme
*heh
my functions seem to work
you got all day
just define a short path and use thay for the parameter and print every result
actually i have no clue why it works the way it does in terms of only needing one click
probably
here ill make a test and see what it returns and that way you can use it (temporarily, obviously youd have to replace it later to avoid ai) to see if its working right
and this should be whats printed
ok i didn't get those values
but not the ones right above
so it seems to be right?
why are you getting such round numbers after putting it through normal2d()
wait a second
i made a coding error
i'm confused
wait
but then how do you figure out what the next value is
ok that's what i've been doing
that's strange
if i do the earlier i get your latter results
but if i do the latter i get your earlier results ü§î
well regardless, it works
targetlocation.x+0.5-currentlocation.x.floor
in that case its the same just without floor
oh really?
i'm going to try submitting mazesolver
yess i got a 1 for fp
why: so you can free up as much ram as possible at once
half hardware half software
my grandma set me up an easter basket full of candy which is nice but she gets me crazy amounts of candy either way lol
try having the findpath return nil instead of an empty list
i have it do list(start) but nil should also work
i had it return list(new coordinate(0, 0), new coordinate(0, 1)) and it still broke
list(start) is nice because if you click on a wall while in the middle of a path your character will move to the cetner of the current tile instead of just freezing (if you code getvelocity properly)
that way if the path is nothing it just returns a new physicsvector(0, 0)
yeah i made that conditional, the problem is its always empty so it just stays in one place
oh mine did that i forget how i fixed it
also have a check in getvelocity to see if the current location is the same as the last item in the path
well i didn't
you think?
oh i just noticed i didnt use distance 2d lol
it shouldn't be actually
i had mine check if the difference in both x's and y's was between -0.1 and 0.1 lol
you know what's cool about my code
i doubt that could be done in scala
just as calculations
ill be on the call in a bit
same
i'm aaaaaalmost done
now i just need to figure out how to get rid of the jittering
i'm so close, it stops on edges now (right before the tile) instead on the actual squares
as in any x, y pairing +0.5 to both
idk why they have the currentlocation parameter as a physics vector
but yeah pretend its a grid location
thanks for asking that anthony i had completely forgotten lol
so the 9 should have a line on top of it
and 0.9repeating is not equal to 1
it is
these are aproximations
3.3 repeating isn't an approximation, its a notation
as for numbers like sqrt(2)
2.9 repeating isn't irrational though
2.(99)repeating isnt an actual decimal if you get what i mean
exactly
so 0.9999999999999999999999 as a decimal can never equal 0
that's why it doesnt
.999999999999 repeating doesnt have a decimal to use in math problem
thats its own problem im not some sorta number rights activist
you can represent it
actually wait that's just how you represent 1/9
to figure out what that aproximates to
i know
me saying fuck the concept of 0.9 repeating = 1
what emil
it represents itself
im sure if you tried hard enough you could find a series to represent numbers like sqrt(2) too
0.9 repeating can be represented by 1/1
its infinitely small but it is still there
i need to do my homework so i will leave you with this: you are wrong because i say so
i can't argue with your logic
oh i watched the video already]
i caved
check the slides
i tried
i still don't get it
i delayed a lot
for calc?
that's really excessive, even for calculus
for calc?!
congratulations ü•≥
i have a question
thus, are functions allowed to have members in their domain that don't map to anything
i think that answer is no, i would just like to be sure
perfect, thanks
np, i can't wait for this quiz to be over my head is fucking killing me
i felt that
nope
imma sleep right after this
i also feel that
or within the domain rather
my grandma forgot to wake me up it appears but thankfully i just am awake
i feel like shit
how dare you
that quiz qwas actually pretty nice
feel better anthony
where is quiz
did i miss it?
it starts at 11:00
where is it?
oh you may have time to finish it then
probably?
yhis is easy quiz
we did it boys
niiice
it says late
we'll see?
at least you submitted something
but i had to get the vespa cuz the scooter is one of the best parts of that game
see i'm a gamer
what
json string..
thank you emil for having a higher iq than me
aaaaah
it is in fact raining
rain
bruhhh
i just do pythagorean
yeah
wait
i agree
it feels like a 3-line answer
this is big facts
ive got the advisement meeting which is gonna be painful
i understand what you mean
new 3x3 cuz it's been awhile since the last one
imo i think i prefer some of the humor in curb your enthusiasm
my adviser said that i should push 202 back
bc she said its important to take cse 116 with cse 191
not bad if i do say so myself
i dont have to
i just dunno how that works because last time around yknow it said we have like 3 semesters to do before we're admitted
thinking of taking something from my junior fall semester so it doesnt suck ass
anyone have dms 220 in their pathway? i might take that next semester
sorry for the interruption in topics, but for anyone who did u5lq4 for 116, how did you install the libraries?
i forgot let me check
i just don't understand how to actually install the import things
unless you want a break between the 4 classes
reminder
has adam set up a schedule? im looking at everyone else's to see where free times allign lol
i don't quite want to speak on anyone else's behalf
final terraria update comes out may 16th
its nice cause i could get food but
so im just gonna complete both whatever you call its this semester
im getting errors in autolab so thats great
ah well
i‚Äôm going to ask a ta tomorrow
i think my code works correctly but
autolab doesnt like my tests
actually i think i did it wrong
i had it so that when an intersection gets a detour message it gives any incoming cars in the future the detour
thats where the car arrives at the intersection
so like road starts at top of intersection1 and ends at left of intersection 2
id consider it as my personal project if i knew how to make guis
regardless of iffyness with stuff like that in who its still unarguably very crucial in this time and its very likely the motivation behind trump's decision was to minimize aid in countries like iran
maybe my test is in the wrong place?
yeah, just copy the entire thing
lol me neither
i can even run the gui
oh i did it in my lecturequestions
because they are connected by the server
what
(that is actually what a ta told me, but i‚Äôll have to ask again)
no i just mean general not the gui lol
uhhhhhh
at least the ta is really helpful and nice this time around
it's actually def functionname(): unit = {
}
that's why i didn't get the 1.0
it be like that
i mean better than not doing them
exactly
i definitely feel that
believe me **i know**
i haven't been able to ask as many questions and feel *there* for learning
testing in a test enviornment for me is already bad enought what makes you think me being home is going to be any better
that's unrealistic
i'm just depressed
look it up and there's a form to fill out
is it that bad
yeah
that‚Äôs what i heard
testing actors üôÉ
ugh i miss real classes
wait
good morning
touche
i like vague advice more than no advice
bc that was in jesse's code
i used a bunch
run the gui in another document first to see that it works
under websocket client
cool
i like seinfeld more than curb cuz it focuses on a wider cast of characters and the characters are younger.
do i just define a value of a new lecture server in the main method of the object and nothing more?
i dont find the office funny, but everyone loves it
anime humour is great
why.
also it has good humour.
for me at least
check all the function commands and string ig?
i found a way around ai for this i think
this is all from the slides so dont worry
did i fuck up anything
what are you guys learning rn
yea optimization
take the derivative, find 0, plug into initial function
l'hopital is weird but easy enough
it currently just says 2k for every one over 16 making less than 130k, 500 per child
trump delayed the relief checks to sign them all which id be upset at if not for the fact that our lives are no distance from satire at this point
it would use vemno, direct deposit etc
go out in public without a mask and get whacked
how do you know its an increment message them
it says to have it check if its of type increment which????
the type isn't the class
wait that string at the start matters?
its a message of type "whatever string it's expecting" that **contains** a certain data type
yeah but what about the message listener part
i cant use the class given because that assumes it contains a string
do i make a class of my own to deal with it?
gotcha
no don't do that
you did it in your code lol
in the server you run a main that literally just returns a new lectureserver
then you run the gui in the other project?
if it's like that then check your dependancies
probably because your server isn't working
make sure your spelling for everything including strings is correct
there now it starts (still doesnt let it run at the same time as the gui though)
you said the other way around
did you know in the pixar cars universe there was canonically a world war 2
i did the code, but not the tests
so you have to make a system, make intersections, make a route that uses the intersections, then make a car that uses that route, then its all time based its weird
but i think i might be close?
when you create a direction the number is the time it takes to go through that direction (arrive at the intersection)
try running a test where only one intersection exists then expect no message for however long itll tell you when it switches from red togreen and vice versa
i think its green east/west when created yeah
i think i understand functionality
evidently i do not
i got it
he said
```side note: my incorrect solution is completely wrong on this one so it will be common to get 3 smileys for testing with very poor testing.
```
that's from jesse
my test randomly fails which is troubling
i see
i looked up honkler missing the joke and thought you were talking about the pepe clown meme (which apparently is named honkler)
god no
jeez on piazza 3 ta's had to cancel office hours today
im confident my code works its just i need it to correctly function 3 times i na row
ill just make the time gaps huge so the difference is minimal
what the fuck
yeah okay
although who knows maybe not
whatever ill just do calculator expansion
they said cookie clicker was
ok what's up with you lowkey liking webdev stuff adam lol
im growing to actors ironically from the car lq but still its just
ah well
for what
like when a car recieves a detour when arriving at an intersection
does it remove that intersection from its directions
its already removed when it gets there
is it a bad idea to mess with a constructor
we should plan a discord movie night!
how about the shining?
i have no clue what im doing wrong
i'm down
and i need to
how many decimals should you give
maybe do like 3
ok so its talking about small businesses and how much money the business owners would be keeping in tax cuts. i think its something that was done to help businesses so they don't go bankrupt during rona
supporting small business is good but this is very clearly skewed in favor of already wealthy beneficiaries and such
theyre 33% of the people included here yet get 81.8% of the liability benefits
33% of companies, especially since they make the most money are obviously going to benefit more from that formula however
i don't think there is a way to make it more "fair" technically
make it so the more you make the less your change in liability is
if you make that much money you should have quite a large rainy day fund
its costs millions to make millions
i would give examples of smaller businesses and how they are handling this but i don't know of any tbh to use as an example
like i say, it should be more spread out, however i feel like we need more data than just net income and number of businesses in said group
im not getting shit
in the new act you would be
yea, it would be spectacular
i mean ideally i wouldnt have student loan debt but democrats really went for joe biden
hmmmm
ik im writing all the formulas down rn
we only do exponential growth and decay right?
hell yeah
morning
morning
jeez
not now though
question: pass fail doesn't effect gpa correct?
yay no gpa change for me!
but if you miss a homework your grade goes down by 1/2 mark (a to a- for instance)
you're probably fine
i couldve hard coded that for all he knows
shrug
i don't enjoy 191, but i appreciate its consistent framework above all else
then another the next
its not in the syllabus or anything
let's just say that there are some... unintended side-effects... to eating such foods
what have you eaten recently
that must be it oof
if i were to wager i'd bet on the candy intake
that sucks
yeah, and the only other teacher that‚Äôs available has a really bad rating
when is your apply date?
so if i don‚Äôt get in the class i might wait a semester to take it
the class is already full, but there‚Äôs a waitlist so fingers crossed
go to the monday lab w me
lab is closed yet valid
ughhhh these are the only a options left
both are friday
that looks like the best schedule i can hope to get
i mean that's fine, i have other work to do
like cs and math
sounds good
no idea
oh wait no
for c you use that formula
ohh ok
it would be nice if you could explain what it does before implementing anything
yeah sure
together
if you want to we can
we should just to make sure
i think i did it?
no more lqs
if you aren't familiar with neurotyping it is digibros latest autism fueled ambition.  imo it's better than meyer briggs
next monday
tomorrow or 27th
i'm still stuck on 3
nice
it only took me 6 hours
bruh
with sockets
yeah
the socket parameter in a listener class essentially is the sender
bc it doesn't read sendeveent
sendevent
you have these imports?
yeah i got the point
probably tomorrow
or actually tonight after this blasted hw is due
191 is making me contemplate life again
i feel the exact same way
bruh
i love the smb2 mushroom and bullet bill mask
just wait until i release super mario bros. 2 2
super mario bros 2 is super mario bros 2 2
super mario land 3 is wario land
super mario land 4 is wario land 2
traffic lq was dumby dumb dumb
i couldn't do it so its bad
intersections constantly message themselves to check the time then when their light changes they tell the cars that they can go if theyre in the right horizontal/vertical
idk im just curious bc like hey get as much knowledge in every language as you can.
also i am doing well, how about you?
wish you luck
can't relate, i don't have games to play
i concur
ok so i did my traffic lq and it works locally
jesse still didn't finish the lo verification quizzes lol
but i forgot
6-8, right?
i should watch it
bruh the post credits
i hate json stuff
me too actually
also, the testclick doesn't work for me
it's *really* well documented
definitely
do you need to fully complete the serverside for testclick to work?
yeah
i hope to get this done today so i can work on my personal project and the project contribution
smart
its actually not that bad
i do have a clarifying question though
yeah?
you made a listener, right?
look at the parameters for ondata
because i made a data structure of clients to username strings
no worries, i'll figure it out
i'm actually starting to not dislike 191 (in this new unit)
i should probably start clicker
ugh i really dont wanna seal with more interviews
only like one more
shouldnt there be 2
sure
how do you open the clicker gui
why isnt sending messages to actors working
ugh why is this one specific map refusing to be defined
it doesnt seem to like when the key in a map is an actorref
this lab is kinda bs ngl
i'm always vague as shit
literally how the fuck do i trace throug the execution??
its more like its creating a socket and then listening to those messages, but fundamentally, yet
.emit means the socket is sending a message toe verything else essentially right
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i would do it in case if you can
i did it and it didn't take too long
just in case
you're good then
but you probably won't need it
done
i finished all the code but for some reason the test isn't working
how do you figure out the elapsed time between updates
is configuration the json string that has all the stuff the gameactor has
its not a server so idk how that works
that's a good question and the answer to that is i don't *think* so
so how does it receive the message
cause it needs the data in it
i don't really understand what you're asking
ohhh
you mean in the data
ok so actually i don't know lol
i appreciate how descriptive this is but it could still afford to be a bit more clear
what are you doing
and they‚Äôre lying to me
id prefer you dont die
huh.
was it **your doctor**?
nah it was just the guy at the door
interesting
so what was your response?
i did it just in case i missed something in data structures
because the data structures lab went really poorly for me
doin great now thanks jake
ugh im not sleepy yet but if i dont sleep now i prboably wont wake up in time for my lab interview
we have 191 quiz monday right
dammit
wait yeah when does the semester end?
hw6 looks more approachable than hw5 did, at least towards the end
i was ssupposed to get a job but thats likely not happening
hope that helps!
4:00 pm would work great for me
i just realized that counting in 191 is basically probability
oh yeah i need to do the tophat
i aree
i put myself on the queue for oh because my gui doesn't work
nope
does she expect us to write the answer to 1000! (divided by some inconsequentially small factorial)
tas are real helpful for this hw
that‚Äôs probably it
i'm ready to work on th
/maybe do some conceptual review for tomorrow's quiz
oh shoot
he can get the rank back at 423
dabu dee dabu die
nope
there is one basic one included
so as long as i have the 1.0 im good?
in that case i just need to do tophat and calc
i just dont like how it looks
woah you can factor out a denominator and just divide the outside
sequences are actually pretty cool
whats the probability of you selecting one of the shirts
think about the probability
probability doesnt matter im looking for amount
i didn't like it
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
[9,0], [9, 3], [9,6], [8, 2], [8, 5], [7, 1], [7, 4], [6, 0], [6, 3], [5, 2], [4, 1], [3, 0]
so thats 12 holes but a lot of them overlap so???
im jsut gonna say true
thats the only thing i have left
these tophat questions all really suck and are vague
ughhhh all these calc assignments are long
