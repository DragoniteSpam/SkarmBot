yeah it turns out boobs and gay arent as funny the eight millionth time you go over it
welp she left
good job
trying to get ida to cone
what does that mean skarm?
bad drago
the sun never sets on it
i dont think she knows what a drago is though she just calls me bad boy and shakes her finger at me
lets get it
my favorite is telling her to eat her veggies if she wants to grow up big and strong
welcome back
we've already had 2 since you left lol
oh man is manimal_aan
bananimal man
its okay kugal i think ur funny
oh ok good
i wish i wasn't working all the time so i could hang out with you guys more often
sounds like a real hoot
you missed dank memes by chuck
wow gummy there's drama in your server and i didnt even get to start it
zeal might have some problems but uh
some of your people are not cut from the finest wood
tb is very depressed
no quotes in that file!
did i forget to save the autoreconnect thing
dragonite 1, dragonite 0
we talked about zeal server
ashbot is proto-skarm
since ash belongs to camelot
insubordination
why?
im not giving you money
fuck everythiing
he invokes his right to remain silent
also
im pretty sure i have logs somewhere though
what do you even want
im pretty sure i only saved general anyway
so that might be good
this is my hiding place
don't let me down <:bingc:508016918809280532>
you prob know most people here
will do
it‚Äôs fine
i don't know you either!
but they were in the original camelot
that works?
wtf drago
no dinner for you ash
nice
play with ash bot
everyone should listen to that ^
it's drago's ghost
communism hmmm
you rang
master told me he ban him
well you also got to ban pogi
he left though
hang on
for god's sake
right i forgot to check that box
wow..
can i be the math girl
how many roles can you attach to a user before discord starts to complain
i dont feel like making any more
okay master strangely msg me calling me a communist
like just calling you a communist or was there some preamble to it
i replied with this
you know sometimes i think about where it all went wrong gummy
nah my true allegiances are
what's up ^w^
no drago
youre almost as bad as me!
unless youre in grad school
are you in grad school
all the random roles lol
what about them
nothing lol
not really lol
tempted to change all of the roles that say "role" to "roll" but i think that joke wont be very funny for much longer
welcome
three weeks ago i planned out my entire youtube channel schedule through 2024
what?
oh sweet
gummy, you and demonlord's opinion on the history behind wwii really helped
oh yeah
now for hitler...that‚Äôs a man that was evil
now that is an issue
guess im teaching him
im surprised you find *that* topic boring
there has only been 3 wars fought on canadian soil
this is after 1867
that was boring, as mean as it sounds
to learn about anyway, the great depression wasnt actually goo *great*
now germany in 30s was interesting
it was funnt
i'm either 12.5% or 6.25% german
well thats what my mom says so
i dont even have a real friggin role
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
i ran around my living room with war music and this gun
im viking/irish
pretending you are in civil war
of all the states why ohio
fuck ohio
that's because we're a failure
if rc were to be here, how much of a chance would he make you his rival?
draco is an ass
i just did
okay that leaves rainy
drago you just gave me a good idea but yeah..
have you ever seen deci in a place where he couldnt just swing the banhammer? he hates it
hey i can too
you have mods quitting on a daily basis
like the supermarket runs out of juice or something
by definition the people who do the most talking are the majority
i know
i thought he might be mature
helps me improve the server
hee hee butt
okay hmm
i wanna see if anyone else feels the same way
no thanks
oh wait
still that got stale
we hated each other
now we love each other
she would say the same thing
im asking her
not my sis!
tb and me butt heads a lot apparently although i havent interacted with him enough to know if he's memeing or serious
hey not everyone there sucks
i see people talk about this artiks person a lot but i have no idea who that is
i looked at chat and saw yanis and meant to say exilon
exilon can be annoying
somehow he isn‚Äôt ban yet
and a troll but a good person
everyone is cool now...
sounds like a plan dragon man
so basically
you do the thing but backwards
you mean he's in a perpetual state of internal turmoil?
he likes me but also wants to crush my head
this is the server theme
make way for my sis!
gummy you have too many sisters
and regal and ida
maybe every time someone says an arbitrary word like "epidermis" we could pretend to get all offended
i built that server from the ground up
camelot had chuck buuilt
im going to buy a bulldozer company
i sent him my video now that i finally posted it and he didnt say a word about the fails
actually that's because it was mostly cutscene and not much fail
get him to star in it
im going to get you to star in it and spend the entire thing roasting you
last time you didn't even wanna collab with me
aint that a pocket monster
wait no its that dude
i had more subs then him at one point
not you btw regal
i meant ida doesn't like flubs
yet she likes gummy
ash meet flubs and regal
i create nothing
this is a true friends server
there are givers and takers but i am neither
drago
who else?
well you're not missing much
just a quiet league stream
im gonna be honest i dont like league lol
yeah
having no computer is one of the worst things for me lol
yeah that sucks, hope you can recover them
kingcorphish is in eyan's chat
interesting
he's one of gummy's old friends
ah gotcha
not like i care
oh no justification needed dear will
i think you can give it to yourself mang
do you want me to do it? lol
ok, what role do you want
uuuh
thanks
hows that?
perfect
thanks
remember that jello?
guys what should i draw? any suggestions? lol
flareon
vaporeon
*cant* üò¶
p!join
random tunes ftw lol
p!play bokura
p!play whims of fate
lol ikr
p!play wake up, get up, get out there
p!play live and learn
p!play shounen yo gekka wo hashire
not the song i was going for rip lol
i bought sis a plane ticket to switzerland
come on man show some respect
a guy name ‚Äújewishdickhorse‚Äù join
i will sis
if he doesn‚Äôt and talks agaib
i will ban him
im giving him a chance
it was horsedick, get it right
i'll give you a hint: there was one whose name ended with eff and started with a j
gummy what have we learned about people who only join servers to screw around
see you should have changed it to something more descriptive like "i have no friends so i try to attract attention by being inappropriate for no reason"
i think ida said he's chilled out a bit since two years ago
and drago let my staff handle him
i did drago
oh yeah also turn off the psu
open it up
the one below the graphics card
now open the product?
indeed theyre quite pretty
1*low profile pcie bracket (for smaller pcs)
yeah put that in the slot. use some force but dont break it
if the other metal thing doesnt fit i guess
do i unscrew the big one off?
yeah
walmartica
spiffing(?)
maybe
some zeal guy finally after like two years
discord deleted their account?
are you sure you aren't him?
that sounds dreadful in every sense of thw word
but then their parents took their pic like it was like some wedding
i dont know how to write cabbage scottish
ive got a friend named scottishgeeks on twitter, i should probably ask him if he's seen the pok√©ymon thing yet
just make all the days the same way
keb-edge
they eat sea cucumber in east asia
blitz is a close friend
sis would be jan 5th 2017
demon lord yours is harder to pin point
dragos a nerd. using the internet in 2011. hah.
all i remember was he told me not to date
jello
now jello
also flubs doesn't believe in the moon so his opinion doesn't count
you said you turned it off
so it wouldn‚Äôt say stuff from here in zeal
not really just set a base date and then send xkcd.com/(date.today-basedate) or something on a 24 hour timer
the service there is crap
happy œÄ day peeps
what happened to the money comment?
on your channel
sis im dying
i'm telling aqua you said xenoblade is confusing
im being like harassed in university
i thought you were gonna say, bring me to your uni so i can axe them
turn the tables on them
oh...yeah that could do as well
or we bring ida and she can chew them for harassing me in a scottish accent
drago
i might actually fail
too tired to do anything besides playing dnd
well im kinda screwed since i been slacking for months
flubs
i old new york is coming back
because old new york is just york
nobody cares about york
idk ask someone who pays attention
the fact that theyre apparently less qualified to do this than you amuses me
also i mean no matter what i say, at the end of the day theyll accept the fact that my granddad said they shouldnt makes it final
no u
i only take 0.5x fire though
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
eh i guess not
how the fuck do i load this thing?
bullets go in the scope
"bite the powder, ram minie ball in, put on cap"
before we aim
this needs to be played in the background
there now where is drago?
you forgot the part where you put your boxers on your head and sing the alphabet song
alright new plan
the fact that youre not playing skyrim for one
finally i get to do what i always dream of
fuckin france
oh tb?
should i like
message him
and tell him that he's not going to get the help he needs by waltzing in and introducing himself by saying "i'm lonely"
no got a babysitter for him
he was complaining over not having a gf
i hope he complains about having a gf now
someone posted a pic of a nude women with a horse dick in every channel
fuckin drago
lets make this server public...
wait we already have a troll here
theres like some weird love thing happening and its horrifying
i saw it but it was weird
my server will allow non bronies but if you post a meme shooting people
yeah thats a rude thing to do
hehehe
how did you see so fast?
i like the trolls that are really witty about it or the ones that are beyond lazy as shit. the ones in the middle are the shitty ones
some are so bad
just not sure if i should still allow invites for everyone or not
gummy you havent been on thw i ternet for very long have you
i think he would be too scared
he acts all tough but he's actually a sensitive giant
nah i can train him to be tough
oh hey hates strangers
oh my
wouldn't he bark then?
she would continue barking
he would probably do nothing
lmao
eoghan says he wasnt drunk but i'm pretty sure he was
probably
i think that was the only zeal raid to ever happened
flubs!
hes the nicest person in my family
it means business if they threaten to you
by the way flubs do you want a color or something
i already have a color though
its white and its great
he's so scared of them lmao
most normal armies are armed with, you know, actual arms
"you think my handwriting is bad? well tell that to my raptor's face."
yes youd know it was him because that sentence confused me a lot
takes a while
i had sidebox/sidebars
xenoblade is weird
my face is weirder than your face
either way
flubs is weird
so 15 year old drago was like this...
fun fact the girl i asked out in high school is in that one for like 1/800,000th of a blurry frame
it sucks and i hate it
damn it
not if i have anything to say about it
there we go
you are not asking my sister out
you better not!
i'd probalby root for her
yeah im the best at dancin
he looks like you
hungry santa 1 year ago
at job interview
"so do you have any special skills?"
that's enough of that i think
he's probablyg oing to be like why do you still have that
i tried to highlight to copy and paste
but eh
my spare keyboard lights up
gotcha
yeah kuudere sounds like part of me
i may be a bit tsundere
i only see the gold one in the members list
same
now stare at this
okay sis
something must have broke
it was seasoned with red seasoning salt
is this the one that you paid like seventy dollars for
gummy you should get one of the $20 ones that my school computer labs use
i'll make sure it finds a worthy home
you could always burn your money
is she a cute single yellow dragon?
hey gummy do you know any cute single yellow dragons
tell her to see a doctor
that takes care of that then
ahhh
would it surprise you guys if i told you i had a waifu?
hey sometimes tbh..i do wanna look cute
even though thats mostly a girl's thing
unless you have a dirty mind and want it to mean something
unless you have a much older sibling like i do
these days we rarely fight
gummy i'm revoking your permission to fantasize now
i mean yeah, that's what you tend to do in a good relationship
my guts hate my guts
wtf did this man do to get suspended...
i should probably think about editing stuff soon
because youtube ban has already been done by me, twitter by rc, so facebook is next
how should i know
i should get my actual sister to join this server
flubs!!!!!!!!!
tell me all about it
well grandpa died which i dont really care about but made the rest of the family all pissy
he didnt die today, he died like 3 weeks ago i just learned about it today
well since hes dead uncle george is now the oldest male in the family so he makes all the decisions and hes a dick
and what was the decision?
let me guess
there were a couple but it comes down to like 5 people arent allowed into the house anymore and are pretty much disowned
yeah, but that doesnt bother me much. the house is almost all vertical, its got like 4 floors but they arent that big
and they wish they had that
and i dont often defend my dad, but not liking him for being the obvious choice is just dumb. he wasnt a good guy by any stretch, but under my grandpa the company was *nothing*
they actually didnt even ask
i thought they hated you
why would they want you closer?
you make bad decisions but not stupid one
and your leadership is better
who is next in line
uncle mike, whos only like 10 months younger
thats mike 1/5
new york flubses only
okay i think for once an emulator is a good idea for this
you're thinking of trying out a pok√©mon randomizer
but would be fun to play
i haven't always kept up with trends
in anything really xd
most modern trends are pretty shit so that's probably for the best
it was on one of those websites. maybe the one i got that sock thing on
flubs
oblivion
that's like 65 at best
make each episode 10 mins long
i wish
those were the days
im a zelda expert
that‚Äôs easy
the dating guy went crazy, did i tell you that?
must have stood next to the radioactive uranium sample for a little too long
why was i assign to deal with this guy again?
no master did
or jello
that guy who was depressed that join zeal server
vaguely
but anything can trigger him back
good idea flubs
i mean i kinda help him get a girl only for the girl to go out with him for pity
what did you _think_ was going to happen gummy
im driving this guy to kill himself
okay flubs bring it on!
for dixie land!!!
global warming yes
master can i link your google doc homework thing or should i find something else
those sexy ass dolphins are going to destroy us all
lets make the world like equestria!!!
speaking of which
there are elections coming up in canada and i do wanna vote for the communist party
well our party is weird drago
and 32 hour work week
im not sure if you understand the history of communism and why it didn't work the first dozen times
and takes all the power
thats what happened with the roman republic
caesar got so much power that he became dictator
flubs i'm appointing you as sir ultra major badass marshall admiral viceroy grand duke chancellor king princess pope president prime minister c.e.o. buddha god governer shogun tzar cesar c.m.o f√ºhrer, ph. d.
guess whos a doctor now, bitches
imma go cut open someones brain and see what comes out
benny attack him
update: there was more brain inside
bronycon is gonna have some drama
it hasnt for a while
drago you coming too
pay me
like errr
that type of intro you could make
show me
i think yours might be better drago
....okay
i'm 80% sure i was trying to delete something else and accidentally checked off some things i didn't intend because i looked up one day and half the series was gone and decided welp there's no point in keeping the rest of it around i guess
this was my enemy
then he deleted most of them
the supergummying era timeline is weird 2013-2016?? but the official official would be 2013-2019
but he was young
oh my
gummy you should go post spam in my comments it'd boost my seo probably
thank god you are here
well that's good then
and im like shit
damn
what video
not that i'm complaining, mind you
right skarm
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
play this game
animal crossing might be my fav game
but it's not skyrim
hey it was pokemon
needs more jpeg?
is that good or bad
tbh it's actually a bit sad that people in the future won't be able to walk into a game store
when i was a kid i remember going to blockbuster all the time to rent games
just low internet speed problems
what type of games sis?
any games
but my internet speed's staying where it is
welp, come to my house then
no idea
it doesnt exist
except for the one over there with the mohawk
must be stuck in the spam folder
flubs
omg flubs
you upload more than eyan these days
yeah
it was better editing than me
well two of my favourite games
videos uploaded
flubs that was amazing video
according to the chinese zodiac tigers and dragons which is me get along well
that explains why you and i get along well
why do you of all people haev to be a dragon
it looks the same
i added snow
oh so he worked correctly before but silently did nothing that time
this is your doing
twenty dollars an hour
but since we're friends i'll only charge you $19.50
no some offer it for free for one time use
yeah there's nothing helping me tolerate it
your parents might kill you
ida i send you virtual hugs
oh you know im dead right?
it‚Äôs over people picking on him, same reason i left zeal several times
but always remember the pat pat method
you did great though
man somedays i need a break from the server
if you dont youll get burnt out and start to resent it
go ahead
but yeah a brony server is hard to run
im surprised flubs
thats what makes them special
sis i swear to god
i think you meant to delete it or something
god damn it
not the site i bought them on
loopy went off the grid and katsukity is like the only one i know selling them now
there site is gone
katsukity said something about trying to return with a new site
it'll be an assfire for everyone else
man some uni students are so cute
i mean errr
no one heard me
gummy stop hitting on strangers
hey im taken so i cannot hit on anyone else
you can
how was math?
i did everything correctly besides accidently messing up the last step on one problem by not pressing a button on my ti hard enough
wanna check that gum?
just go find a tank with those dimensions and water and test it
good good
so is the 2ds just like the newest version of the ds? because it looks like a normal ds
it is
flubs wanna replace bella/someone who is no longer present?
flubs
canada talk, university. i am attracted to a woman
my legs don't work
non that's mostly kugal
iceland school work work school iceland. sheep something i think. gummy is a mess and i must fix him
well making any progress is an accomplishment
stupid though....thats a different story
which frustrates some people to no end
gummy i don't love you
the stupidest thing i did this morning besides hot chocolate was not notice my backpack had a hole in it
isnt that a kind of pig
hmm it's two in the morning i should think about sleep
yeah
aint nothing manlier than taking back whats yours and preventing the capitalist dogs from taking your money
and im surprised no one also realized it
also apparently the piano is a woman's instrument
guys shouldn't be allowed to play
wait till they find out im dating a trans woman
i found out my gf lives in the same city pewdiepie lives in
so you can meet the most famous youtuber and do a collab with him
welp
flubs protect my jacket at all cost
any costs
wtf?
like weed cake?
and you didn't know?
i dont think those would
yeah there wouldnt be any difference
total war is like my all time favourite game series
in general though total war beats animal crossing by a tiny bit
and your fave game is skyrim
nah my favorite game overall is dishonored
close but actually it would be mario galaxy
my favorite game uh
close enough
okay i would play that tbh
how do _you_ wear your instant noodles then?
that was not a personal choice, sometimes you just get noodles on your head
you should have
she knows my bday
fairly sure flubs actually got it right
uhhh
what's the age limit on dream daddy
fucking isabella is annoying
i'm not interested in the details thanks
i will destroy this town
why are you stalking me on _3ds_ of all places
what is it?
and they are selling transformers toys
since 20012
i lied
i wanna leave but they called me over
eh go ahead
.....
welp
but it‚Äôs worth it
so are most parents
this is my hero
flubs
yea you're right
well if it's a day late then it won't miss it
which anthony
the one who likes sylveon
his name is anthony?
there are a lot of people named anthony
but not pizza
something about her heading on the route to eterna forest where the screen turned black while she can hear audio only and then it went black and had weird text then took her to the ds screen
yes but strange since you rarely have big glitches
caught you, you motherfucker
read the tex
i sent my sister jackson parodi's accordion metal and now i'm trying to get her to play accordion metal and she's complaiining that she doesn't have an accordion
flubs we are watching this when it comes out
calculus ii midterm tomorrow and i dont feel an ounce of nervousness for it...good thing?
oh morrowind
_your_ homework is boring
my brother got the free morrowind game
judging by his frustration just downloading the game
so apparently there's a couple of new switch models in the works
cool
because shaymin did it?
ooo i should look at yours and ida's old post on forums
see what young drago has to say
it was mostly in the chatbox
ida is always angry at me
since it was a pretty dark time for me
and eyan for that matter
i was memeing and this happen
it was a joke
remember the patreon thing
(kendall is my new new sister)
take mine
3 non blood
only if i get all your money when you die
wtf drago
be nice to toad dude
i would love to read what they said
i don't have early interactions with drago either
i still have skype logs on the old granny laptop but i dont feel like turning it on and searching for them
therefore you do something
homework to me
no u
beat that
hey i sold those sharks for a total; of 45,000 bells
how rude!
only if you do my homework for me
the answer is 17
wanna go drinking with me when i turn 19?
maybe i don't actually
do vikings drink?
dude you have no clue what i went through
rc kept telling me it was a total lost
everyone
make way for vortex!
i'll just give you all of them
epic
woah that was forever ago holy shit
and you do it more than eyan lol
i never look at it
wait relationships
was pimaster older or younger?
i think i'm the 2nd oldest here
oh ash bot is kinda here vortex

noooo
math can be your enemy
yes!!

thats a sis thing
have a pony instead
no thank you
wooooooooo
might as well drop this here while i'm here
maybe make it the next vine
and by a lot i mean 2 uploads lmao
will be releasing everything
since i feel like copyright on twitch is a bit better
also i just prefer twitch in general
since twitch was made for streaming
if only i can stream better
stupid internet
drago your house is on fire
toasty
also drago
good because i'm cutting your salary mister
i will go to your twitter
and read young drago tweets
theres almost twelve thousand of them, have ufn wiwth that
your face is a meme
that's a shitty meme mate
pay attention
well i mean you also just like a bunch of bitches
irl really bad
flubs tell him he did!
soo can't
now it qualifies as a work of art
exactly
with a friend ü§î
since switch
i've heard fire emblem awakening is good, that's the only game i'd like to get at this point
anything else
bad bella memories, only bought it for her tbh
i enjoyed that quite a bit
hmmm surprised you didn't say smash
might find that in stores
yeah but i will be sad when 3ds is gone
do any of the 2dses use the clamshell design
the xl does
youre probably turning into a zombie
cute
well im pretty sure spots on my arm are contagious
i keep getting some crap about r slash entitled parents
(‚ïØ¬∞–¥¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ /(.‚ñ° .\\)
sis gets my pc
ok, let's play a small game. give me a scenario where you, as a medieval rpg character, would be casting a spell. i'll bring back the results.
the fireball fizzles out in your fingers, but the dragon's face is suddenly covered in dish-shaped scars
and they suddenly sprout fangs for no apparent reason
sure
sure
a lightning strikes the dragon on its head, and for a seemingly unrelated reason, all flesh on one of its forelegs suddenly vanishes, leaving just the bone
can i cast anymore?
sure
2334 caster's spellbook giggles in the presence of other books
to teleport? sure
cast a spell on you to make you do my assignment for me
and make my twitter look good
why do you even want a banner when youre trying to get banned
he died
take that drago
but my twiiter
one of my fav youtubers is returning
mostly look at kay...ida because i know that will ping her and drago
didn't get pinged but saw this anyways
‚Äúgummy what have you been thinking of?‚Äù
you. feel better
actually flub you also seem proud of your past
fried or roast?
well the man was depressed
i mean he always seemed like a decent guy in chat
flubs
can you send me that amazing banner you made for me?
heres both
thanks
what did she end up picking?
corphish is living with a pedophile!!!
okay he found out a few hours ago thank goodness
good job
blade lord nayru
superspamming
thats redundant kugal
thats oxymoronic
there we go
as you can see
i'll pay _you_ $50 for it then
and then ill take it back because you wont need it when youre dead!
guys wanna hear a joke
no? too bad here's the joke: my life

besides your bday
all pranks are good as long as they arent just "haha i lied to you"
true
the best gift you can give is your presence
eh i would get you one of those cooking aprons
aprons are for nerds, cool kids dont care if they get burning hot food on them
and im going to...
think of something
hey im not addicted
i only know all the lore and have watched and read the whole thing multiple times
idk uhh i watched the first episode of the office
gummy did
i'm sure our number of customers today was in the quadruple digits
lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
back hom
im hiding in her closet
only i don't read
this was what i used before i got ban
when..was this made..
i know i didn't make it
ohh kingcorphish made it
i personally didn't know the dude, but the main person that exposed him is a girl i been following for many years
the hot one on my twitter likes
apparently only a few people knew but had no evidence
now evidence has been put out and corphish has been hurt i know that for sure
that is floaty lady
yay for calling in sick
<:pikasanta:516171795196542986>
hmmm
he knew about one of the pedo
that's good, he strikes me as one of the better pok√©tubers
i haven't really watched his stuff but i know he gets along well with other let's players
yeah he is nice
but i _kept_ my name as "spam" for a reason
you really aren't part of the pokemon community
otherwise you would be talking to corphish
your emote
flubs would be something...
all people are food, silly
main community?
community less
my 3 favorite things to talk about are drugs, my impending death, and sadness
the community of that guy in his pfp
but im pretty healthy because exercise or whatever so it could be more than that. but life is inherently chaotic so i could get hit by a bus tomorrow and die
hit him!
i mean she doesn't need you to tell her to do that
back in the old days ida annoyed drago
well back in the old days it was unintentional
i see
i need to say something to piss everyone off
it needs to be more stupid
how was that?
yes!
also tell them that people who are different than them are still people
do you know anyone from the south i want to try that it sounds exciting
i do, theyre related but are not dating
bunni
gummy tell bunni that a pirate ship was born on jesus and tell me what she says
that gets truer by the day sadly
what you upgrade to?
millions
i might make quiz later
how does flubs know my pizza toppings well?
got 7/10 on dragos
tbh i know nothing about mlp
i just picked random ones so
you want to pet a rabbit
bunni
how are yall
wait you actually have a gun?
i got all the math ones wrong because of course
see 2 is the worst score because if it was more than that it would be better than guessing on average but if it was 0 or 1 it would be comedic
flubs help me fix this
did you fuckin rip it off the slider?
it was an accident
pull it down real hard and get it aligned under it
what if i end up pulling it off?
and how did you get mlp and equestria girls wrong?
the night is young
kill me
this is equestria girls
wait let me check
damn it
samsung galaxy
anyways good night
yeah
anyways counting everyone
except for jeff
i'm having fun at your expense
and i do like deci
they weren't in the original camelot though
yeet
i like deci when he's not being a knob at someone
errr
dude r/pcgaming is so fuckin funny
ive never seen people more angry about nonissues in my life
xeon
i take it you dont use twitter
i follow mostly game devs on twitter so theyre usually at least not stupid about it but i generally hear what the drama involves there
you or me
me because my tolerance for others is far lower than yours
tbh stormy tolerates me
s t o p
wait
remember?
delivery flubs?
like did you say "yo bitch your friend is fuckin dead" or were you nice about telling her
that drama scarred everyone
no they don't have permission
so flubs
so far patching things up has been going super well
go for it my dude but imma warm up my "i told you so" laugh
damn
twice
hey no flipping off buildings
so i chased after her
`e!re` has been axed and it's staying axed
fucking hell
time to make lillie bot work
e!kenobi
gummy stop hitting on fictional characters
what in the name of flubs is shazam
detective pikachu is so disappointing
flubs you liked the emoji movie youre not allowed to talk about these things anymore
any movie can
how about
no joke
it is not the last one no
you ever seen dora's tits my dude
fbi we have you completely surrounded
flubs you are under arrest 
come out with your hands in the air
but pls pls tell me you know my favourite movie
this is easy
thats my second
i would not have guessed that
fucking micheal bay
flubs whats your fave movie again?
oh so thats why you like drums
which i didnt include
gummy if you want i can make covers for ya
drum covers
that'll be expensive but the main expensive thing will be getting an interface
hmmm covers
call it a thermo exam
for me it isnt april yet so i cant make a joke
well gummyland has already started celebrating
you did pretty well on that kugal
i didnt make mine easy at all
you gotta make a better quiz
you knew her for years
im making another quiz
basically well enough for kay to do good
what has zeal done?
camelot i decided to go easy
dammit got 4
did i do your quiz yet?
i think so
i see
home at a totally normal hour
whats up with it for you
my waifu with...aj!!!
is that a saying?
nice
put the bullet in the open end, press the button, it goes out the other end
police says it ain't strong evidence
are they renting the place or do they own it
thats fair
wait you mean to say all youtubers arent millionaires
when you find out someone isn't someone you thought they were
whole bunch of weirdos
because death
so do you just stare irl?
sis would be sis irl
actually i know she prob would be more shy irl
you say i complain all the time
what's forums
its ponies but also with dictators
less dictators and more the mods suck
im happy mlp spoilers got super active
also there are no rules here
honestly we are all mature enough to talk about politics and not post nsfw
this one is blessed
thats fair sis
the idea of splitting people into left and right sucks
i agree sis
the guy with the birds
by the dude
yeah sis
gummy i'll vote for you purely on the grounds of putting "and stuff" in your campaign slogan
err what else
death penalty i have different opinions on
gummy make a pun i want to sentence you to death
iceland has the best equal rights
i tend to closely follow all the political news in the u.s.
don't know how i've kept my sanity
but my mom and i talk about it every day
its socialism when its helping people not starve but its capitalism when its a mutli-billion bailout to a company from the govt
a presidency is cool though because you normally take 8 year cycles hating and loving the person in charge
plus i love tradition
but the party i want
when there is no food allowed in there
no drago
gummy keep your pants on
no no keep them off
im wearing this right now
the lawn chair, you may observe, is not wearing pants
night sis
but the studios that made shriek
and then suing humanity
she really fuck a bee
she does not fuck the bee no thats just my head canon
omg i‚Äôd completely forgotten about most of them
except like 5 people
flubs
need you...for something
flubs
thats true, but usa does have better stuff
alright
most of the time
alright sis is twilight, no argument about it, loves reading, strong leadership, prob could fly, and knows magic
flubs you are...hmmm
okay lets compare bella and ida to a sibling way since bella did tell me i was like a brother
oh gosh lol
witness shoplifting while you are there
then leave and necro walks in
yeet
im not gonna try to spell that right
see how stupid i was
cause i remember bella being on both at the same time
everything you do is cringe, dont worry üòÑ
flubs i apologized for wanting you to burn
lets quiz you
eat the wings!!!
i think the limit comparison test is cool, nuff said
see when people see dragon runes on my back they just assume there's already something wrong with me
i tried to self promote
but errr
i don't think the name is the issue here
why does she have like 7 axes in here
i cleaned it up for her
is it possible to have sex with the eiffel tower? seems a little cumbersome
to paris!
also the i was reading messages in your server from earlier and the way tenda just shut that person down is goddamn hilarious
flubs hates france
my desire to shove the eiffel tower up my ass trumps my desire to stay away from france
who was that person?
good idea
theres a lot of people who go there for tourism and trash the streets, but off of the main tourist areas its real nice
people suck
is turkey a place people want to go?
do you know discord well
maybe
ooh whats to eat
i decided to get a logo for my gummy jacket
also why the fuck
hey it's funny\
alright
it took you four minutes to get that joke
seems like since kingnappy has fallen there is now a new king in the pokemon community
flubs you missed a raid
flubs is always watching
my server of course
im the server troll here
just meme pfp are easy to ban
he does sometimes get a little accidentally rude when talking with one of his buds thats a furry but thats because hes stupid
tiberia primea
i wanted to buy monster hunter world and had the steam funds to do so, but was too lazy to do it. it just went on sale so i saved money by being lazy
so you benefitted?
you know climate change
how you know?
deal
gummy i got a pizza coupon that says "bring this in and we'll give ya a free pizza"
wanna go out on a dat w/me
this is good
what state again?
nevada
okay that ain't far
sounds great see ya then
he likes pizza
eh he can hang out at the entrance
sounds good
i use class for reddit
someone dm me over an issue with someone else
sometimes being an owner sucks
hhhh
noooo
never let me drive agaon
car looks bad tho
drove into a traffic sign
panicking is natural, your in a machine that can hurt someone or yourself, but the important thing is deep breaths
that's why i don't drive
okay unless you are a city kid
never get them to start at the city
less cars and you aren't as pressure
god i wish i was there right now, see what i can do to help
can we have a channel to post/recommend music and stuff
what do we call the channel?
btw go ahead and make anything you want on this server
i'm still on the road
deep breaths and drive slow
though be careful of snow and ice
our highways barely had anyone
i made it
im just dead
probably
left is this way < right?
that was correct
my turn to teach how to drive
my sister is brushing my dog's teeth
flubs
come back when youve done like 14
the sun never sets in gummyland
flubs is tired of existence. he needs rest
wanna see?
thats real nice
im always tired
how about u
are you still going to be a history teacher?
gummy why is my nose on fire
because i threw hot sauce at your face
2071.1
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
never heard of it
yeah you got that big ol fish recently right
aminal it took you like 5 years to breed those two animals in whatever that game was
welcome to my life üòâ
lets watch drago's videos
im rioting
alaska
i love the cold but its still not canada
you haven't truly lived until you've listened to this
hmmm
oh duh
well "work"
i have to find the electrical power needs of chicago
and now i dont know if i want to read it more, or less
watch the viking video drago
shit wrong server
eat that drago
yes!!
ok om nom nom
what is it?
so yesterday i discovered the names of the player characters in pok√©mon sun and moon
i had thought they were just called sun and moon lol
the black hole is very cool
it's cute i guess
i mean its a hole. its black. what did people expect
are you calling my mom skinny
```[4:27 pm] dragonite: "million trillion kilo meters"
[4:27 pm] dragonite: it's fun when science people try to make numbers understandable to noobs```
wow thats like 8 zeroes
it's a sextillion meters which is hilarious in modern english
and this is ida
the spear wielder rarity is dressed like
son of an indian sun god
how did it taste
why me
just because im on social media and pretend to listen doesn‚Äôt mean i can‚Äôt get the job done
my mom had a student last year who walked out after she told her to put her phone away
drago
i know she would win
so apparently there's gonna be another trg colosseum soon
should be fun
i need someone to pay for my flight
why my server is connected to manechat when it‚Äôs not i‚Äôll never figure out
aw shit
you taught him that trick
who even
does that one even know what sex is? because its real hard  to do it through discord
i mean if you think about it life is an std, you put the thing in the thing and then the lady has a foreign body sucking the nutrients out of her blood for 9 months
the fat kid
i guess?
god i hate him even more
he finds out in the middle of the episode he isn't moving but doesn't tell his friends until the end
what a fuck nugget
he takes the pokemon and was like "oh yeah guys im not moving" and giggles
then she just takes his pocket balls and runs off
-random weirdo, 2019
<a:justkiddingipostedpp:399726365248847873>
sure why not
but that only ended up confusing eyan lol
and im actually good at grinding money in that game
people have a hard time understanding big numbers, they should just take the base-ten log of the vote total to make things easy for the noobs
cause if every vote is placed in the hat 3rd parties would have a greater chance with the hat than the current election system
but then having the vp actually do something is an intersting twist
or ancient city
define those
wait no im 20 not 2
rothenburg, germany
do you guys ever voice on here?
he makes funny joke right?
you remind me of the scot trainer
only angrier
hey im edgy but i dont call him a libtard yet
im edgy
hi edgy
if that's the case then you're both edgy
thats amazing
also they hate the golden knights
there is no opinion or emotion in that statement
and therefor the last normal movie?
actually maybe
the other jedi
we already memed the shit out of how they can repair the timeline
sounds good
i wouldve recorded if i knew i was gonna win but id been trying for a while. the trick was to not die
also witcher is like 40 gigabytes so good luck me
it relieves stomach aches
actually don't answer that
because i live here
never met a maltan.... maltese..... person from malta
my turn to teach her how to drive
or the local asylum
the phone just does it
why is it that my favourite sibling is also the only sibling besides my real sister that is embarrassed at most of my stupid activities?
exactly
i mean what
does this mean ida would actually be true sibling if we were related?
i dunno you should ask her
huh?
adopt me ida
thats what i meant
no i can't handle that level of responsibility
if he chews on the furniture just swat him with a magazine
holy shit
hey im almost legal to drink
2 more months
yeah but i dont need to worry about my health
drinking ain‚Äôt always bad if you do it casually though unlike drugs
still not good for your liver and shit though. but yeah a glass of wine with dinner is much better than a gram of coke with dinner
helppp
sooo she is officially officially sibling material as well
ooh trolls are fun
wait what
any day
kids
it sucks and i hate it
idk how to even code this
gummy im getting bored of editing xenoblade, should i take a break and edit the thing im lets playing after that instead?>
wtf is this
still don't care for twitch tbh
its every time link says excuse me princess in the lengend of zelda the animated series
my eyes
but still, link should always remain a silent protagonist
good fuckin job go get that shit
they sell sport equipment and shoes
i mean shoes could mean anything
high heels are sports shoes you ever wear those shits?
idk man im bad with money
shit should be an olympic sport
i don‚Äôt wanna get fired though
go to dollar store
and more candy
i worked at a grocery store who lffered competitive wages and flexible hours and it was like "yeah, competitive and flexible for them"
holy moly i finally solved this damn calc challenge problem
ah sorry its crazy math so the answer is actually sin3
i already staked a claim to his pizza
don't waste food
i had a&w last night
had a foodgasm
a warm body puts mickey d's to shame
micky d's doesnt take as long either but it's also not freshly made like a&w
in and out is trash
and meet drago
never heard of them
dq, imo, is again, pretty ok
i wanna try it
how bad is it?
they put 150% more tomato sauce than what is recommended
i like extra sauce
unpopular opinion
prob not
this is where gummy looks up my school on google maps
i havent had them since like second grade
i had dominos a long time ago, hated it
had it again recently, and i think they redeemed themselves surprisingly
dominos isnt bad but not my fav
not the best but ccheap
there's a buttload of wendy's by me for some reason
cherry cook?
prob best drink for you anyways
i happen to live in the only state where gambling is legal
besides i spend more money in walmart on transformers toys then casinos
but it's g1
i dumped another 20 gb on nier automata recording today
i thought go big or go home
probably less than 8 tb
this looks cool
but how else will you keep your butt smooth
or else no mor free pizza
putting food in the microwave at 12:26 am wont wake everybody up, right
you did it first
blame my sis for not sharing with you
i don‚Äôt like pickles
in reality i love being called a nerd, i live to be called a nerd
we wouldn't have technology if it weren't for them
man studying is dumb
wait
imma viking now
alright how do i sign up?
this is so sad i‚Äôm actually in tears
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaa
that sounds like work
how about you play skyrim instead?
three is easy, it's just floor(tau*0.5)
five, on the other hand
you should mention how awesome your dog is
but definitely started to not do the best at the end
i rounded up
don't answer that maybe
i do on most weekdays
because tomorrow most places are close
holy shit
how i know this...well i did read the bible twice
what food?
so yeah
demon lord can you ask him why god gave us catholics if he loves us so much for me
most priests are usually pretty cool people. course the other ones are...not good to be around
its fucking bonkers
it was this month back in 2017 when i last texted him
my apartment to acquire food units
bye bye flubs
i would but money
well now you know
i thought agaravin was a guy....
wtf is this?
that's
gawain with a rarity cross dress it is then
also fate/ gareth was a girl
oh i know gareth is a girl
i only picked those 4 because wiki says they were related to mordred
look at likes
fairly sure agravain's a half brother on mother's side
i have a strong dislike for fire emblem these days
oh wait that's the reason isnt it
and no reply
my two fav sis are also pretty easy forgiving
the japanese version
there's an english one now
yeah
pepperoni
okay i'll eat it
....so that's what the app is called?
wooo got a reply!!!
she replies to like everyone so it shouldn't be a big deal but it still is for me
i find the fact that ida keeps getting asked about it funnier than the fact that the app actually exists
it's one of those icelandic people things i guess
i also constantly get people replying with "cool" when i tell them i'm icelandic
then i realized you two were not alike at all
rapidash would burn you
it's on fire remember
oh yeah...
i havent played pok√©mon since i kick gummy's exfriend's butt with a shuckle last summer
no...i wanna eat them not die from radiation
ida did you even see the shuckle battle, my strategy was to just sit there and do nothing until she got mad and did something dumb
weakness policy multiscale is the most broken thing ever and it feels like cheating every time i use it
well it's fairly predictable tho
gummy, flubs does not marijuana
not even heroin?
i havent done cocaine i think
the ones youd expect from a pasty white kid pretty much
so like
fuck
you are legal
yeah but half the fun of drinking is im not supposed to. now that i can i just feel like my mom or something
why did you check?
oh so thats why its been so colorful lately
most of the new episodes we talk about are in mlp spoilers
if you right click on a server
i guess we have a more colourful personality?
i thought for sure flubs was trying to beat my record back in zeal
more than gummyland or less?
i wouldnt be surprised
flubs is going upstate to yell at his relatives because apparently im not done with this shit yet
yeah. theres literally no reason i shouldnt be included and yet they wont
i have my gummy cannon with me
holy fuck why is the house so far north
wait who is taking you?
a friend is going to buffalo to visit family and theyre taking me. the timing is good so im using the weekend to fuck over their easter too
but if you show up now
you can't fuck it up
so that's something lol
id rather not exercise the privilege for a while but what can you do
"fine, whatever, just go away"
but seriously
forgot to tell everyone here
kugal you are such a nerd
math and english and the writing i tried my best but reading and science were like 'fuck it'
i dont remember ever watching a singe episode of that show
steak for dinner üòÆ
give me some
help
blitz is a fat boy
nice lol
no hug back?
i swear to god if i have another diarrhea attack
started with milkshake
"lactose intolerant"
you can also develop it
kinda sucks
could be something else?
if you think i can help
what is a democracy?
is a big one
well i definitely wouldn't be getting that at gamestop
dude how are you not hungry

what kind?
ask wolfram whats the answer to int (arctan )/x dx

oh drago
8 or 9 year old me loved the shit out of transformer action figures
im starting a collection
it ain't worth it
im returning my toy today
returning a toy
because he's a butthead
i‚Äôm gonna drink my stress away
school is eating my ass
same
i haven‚Äôt started finals yet. they‚Äôre week after next. my teachers just decided to give us a bunch of final projects
you must die a slow and uncomfortable death by dehydration
just turned in a research paper today and my teacher was like ‚Äúhere‚Äôs another paper‚Äù
gross
papers actually wanna make me stop existing
gross
oh yeah gotta get the stream to work
after you get this job done i can beat you up?
yeah
thats also taking time away from me since im researching
i got him down to $50
what the crap balls
but litten resist fire
okay...
but not all the time
take the one past the shelf date
i may have errr yeah
i ordered a pizza
maybe there was a mass exodus to 99
oh wow
nice
oh just found out i passed my hardest class with a 62%
and a gummy hand
better gummy hands
fair enough
all yours flubs
their slogan makes it seem like they arent
one couldve just bought the other and they couldve ruled the continent
unless mcdonalds gets to them first
the newest and biggest one closest to me
and my favourite walmart but also the furthest one
that's where i do 90% of my grocery shopping
i live next to one actually
well cross the street
so if i ever visit a place, first stop would be walmart
old people
ok but why
because i like hugging you
with someone thinking if they should call 911 or not
but violence is half the fun
are you calling dumban old
then talk to my other sister kendall
thats why i have 3 internet ones
im kinda scared but me too
i knew it
wait that is flubs
but maybe magfest 2021
witnesses?
that being said
am i good or what
that might not be 100% it
its exactly like youd expect, it seems kinda fancy but isnt
that's exactly what i would expect
i wanna go
but first thing i wanna do in new york...
we had a target in town but now we dont
they replaced target with lowe's where i live
lowes is dumb
hardware stuff
i went to a lowes once
isn't that guy a poet?
dirt bike racing
hmm or she can use a team of sylveons
such a shame since he went from that typical bully when we were young to a nice person in high school
sure why not
wait damn it
thought you were a fan
if you are a fan of avengers and have no seen endgame, don't look ^
can i spoil avengers for you?
loki ain't coming back
bucky got the short end of the stick though
why?
oh i was wrong, endgame isnt the end of phase 3. the next spiderman is now a part of phase 3. so black widow is probably the first of act 4
im anticipating getting fucked hard for it
we didnt eat a bite
says here pork should not be eaten pink
food poisoning here i come
eh if i do then whatever
that is no fun
wait there was another person i know with food poisoning
hmmm
what kind of chcolate?
that always fixes something
i swear im not racist
do you like white chocolate then?
hmmmm
the more you have em the more liekly you'll get sick
no...
kappa
or yea what he said
ok im done being a pain in the ass
huh neato
maybe you can do it again for extra credit
but i like this better
i ‚Äúhired‚Äù for free a person to make a website for my server wooo
oh shit
it was like april something 15-17
lets go blitz!!!
two years ago
i actually wanted to rework that
i'll send you a version of it with fun modifications
yeah i knew that
it's 9 episodes long
i would but my mom dragged me to walmart
fricking tb got ban in 2 more mlp servers for asking people for sex
and asked for sex there
would not be surprised if he were to go back to my server and act like a moron there
he's the one who i complained about going "hi im depressed and everyone hates me, im going to go on a hiatus from discord" aboit twice a day in gummyland
i think thats better
dont get me wrong, the server is still fuckin *weird* but not because of that
oh god someone get kugal the anatomically correct doll
to each their own
my sister is in this server
what you mean to tell me is this lad got one girl, and then got a second
tb's ex who i hate has offered to make me a website
well kendall likes you, and she also wants to talk to ida but at the same time jokingly jealous of her
i have trouble remembering which brony is which
not my fault they are like my sis
is kendall a mod or a weirdo or both, thatll be how i remember from now on
also a transgender
yeah theyre a rad lad
a yes, sportsball. the national pastime.
idk why but they seem to like you even though you are a non brony
they arent trigger happy your just trigger depressed
i know
i just feel guilty for banning a depressed person
if you did something really bad
agreed
exactly
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
this was what he said to me a month agp
what kind of play would you have said yes to?
pok√©mon d/p wifi battle

gummy we are no longer friends
yes he is
i still have my yahoo email, its kinda crap but it was my first email and i still have important accounts built using it as an email
arson is physics
not like i have assignments to do or anything
crap the quote is "i can teach you, but i won't be held responsible for what you do with the knowledge"
look it's not like i told him to do it
ohhh she is gonna hate me for that one
i think the correct word would be "had" your last name because i think she will be un-relating to you shortly
ready for this?
kugals last name is nerd
change your name
my dad originally wanted to name me carol
or vibaldi
vivaldiblitz

now that is a nice pick
even though yanis has the sexiest accent
fuck those guys
eh, not really
you wear dresses
venice is garbage right
...what
i actually don‚Äôt look that bad....
one of my favs
just put dragon runes on it
he is safe
he likes pokemon drago
alright then
you should already be bowing yes
yes, my commandment is that all subjects shall be made to read danganronpa
guys my garbage disposal says "insinkerator" on it how do you feel about that
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
he probably washed his face
when gummy tricks me into joining the mlp server
yes he washed his face in my lap which hes been sitting in for a couple hours now
i give my dog less than a fist sized bit of food every day and he finishes it like 1/2 the time
i second that
no she was already a weirdo
then broke one kinda
but i threw it on the ground
are you sure this isn‚Äôt eyan?
gummy i got 100 on todays history test are you proud of me
tell me about it
and it ended off with obama's presidency
my history book went up to him when i took a history class while he was still in his first term
does his name mean fart in scottish
i can't imagine it'll be that positive though
alright i think thats all im gonna say on that to not stir shit
classes get really passionate and those only have like 40 - 80 people as it is
probably one of the more interesting things of the class
we got to go home from school after just an hour
that's about when we went home
we were not there for a terribly long time
8:46 am and 9:00 am according to my history book
jesus
it was fun
thats a lot of significant digits
good drago
on no
yea wtf china
wait
welp
since his bday is on 9/11
you mean like the big things on the power lines?
give me
gummy i dont know if those are safe to have in your house
only if flubs plays with me though
sure drago
funny you mention that
okay if the file ever opens
all right anyway
who's masae
no it was yours
you're just useless
wait i can just pin both
you could also screenshot it and pin the screenshot
fuck you
though im the favourite
nooooo
didn't even know until 30 seconds ago
so basically, it's probably going to come out around holiday2022?
i made a new anthem
today, today, today
just cut any pizza into 50 slices
alright drago
but only if it's veggie pizza
give me meat
what the crap is lood
it means lewd
i no longer have a keyboard addiction
this was a used one for $62?
what mechanical switch do you have?
theyre reds iirc
why is your server so loud
did i ask a question?
sup my dude
god im really starting to fuckin lose it
you fell on the floor right?
ooooh
calculate the impedance of an lrc circuit
typos
kugal stop being young
what the hell gummy
well
im already awake tho
the american education system sucks
imma teach you then sis
thanks
close to $2k
mine was 700, dropped another 80 on ram and another 80 on two more hard drives because you can never have enough hard drives
fun fact about animal crossing in smash is that if you play on the animal crossing stage between 8 pm and midnight on a saturday, k.k slider will be playing music
i wanna play now
i got see the pikachu movie
5 times
its 8 notes long and loops infinitely
did you listen to the song i said sounds like benny?
soo thats why i think of benny
or is he the one that founded the usa
movie was sold out
what kind?
yummy
you should talk about how the new york mets are going to have a very good summer
*noms ribs* i like ribs
i guess most of them were like drago you are a banana or whatever
im seeing a pattern here
üòÆ cupcakes!!!
mine are vanilla
so like
i think its a good thing, we should normalize it
why not put it in a kids show?
i'm all for normalizing it, but i don't personally think it needs to be in shows for young kids
i think kids tend to know about sexuality/feelings a lot earlier than people seem to realized
true
i love gossiping
i think i should have said girls
ohhh mb
source: he went and pointed that out
my brother wants to be a teacher and he goes "um, er, well" even more often than i do
so flubs you are wrong
hes the worstest
looks good actually
bad pic but you get the point
i only share cupckaes with cool people
i made a pony
then made it in human form
and this pony is based off me
you're awful
good
which one is you
wait a minute
i love flubs
yeet
it would also be funny to have ida there babysitting us but that might be logistically more of a challenge
i may dwell on here.
jared did a bad
what was her name again >.>
she was his ex wide
no that's not why i want you to go but okay
why you want me?
just catch her on a good mood
i dunno if he'd like traveling
ida has a bunny?
made a <#578002937544966145> channel
going to have to remember that exists
thats absurdly funny gummy
im not sure if that's how it works but sure
imagine being that full of confidence
oh no
no please go on im almost there
i recommend shitting
so cute
should i troll them?
he yells a lot
baby charlie!
ida are you in the process of waking up, or in the process of going to bed?
she died
ida you hurt my feelings
<:fluttercry:570771095033085952>
<:kurisusip:561042019112321034>
hey im better
here
they explain what it does so often
well in that case
god i hate this fucking planet
anything i can help with?
it's been a rough few years for me
i know i haven't always shown that on here but yeah
thanks
people currently active in zeal send their regards
give him cake
pizza
good good
star is that you?
there are too many rarities in this chat
there's only one.
it's my favorite from all 2d scroller ones.
it does in a way.
nice.
try to get one that's not on life support
life support?
because it's very old and was used for several thousands of hours
so now my working 3ds doesn't leave my desk ever
i see.
maybe a few
why aren‚Äôt you in gummyland today?
only we two.
no about graduating
she refuses to watch with me
i see.
i tried
my brother also graduated hs too, his walk on stage was legendary lmao
never
they post clop. it's disgusting.
guys
nah sounds entertaining
mjhvbjjkh
i think i have an extra one in the shed if you want it
thats impressive
and he would look at his left
92% on criminology final and holy bollocks i got 11% on my calc 2 final
at driver
i feel so lied to
(ida you didn‚Äôt have to point put the obvious)
it cost me $120 just to take the exam
120 fucking dollars
i bought a webcam becuase it was required, those are expensive from what they want me to get
such bullshit
i still plan on being at streams but i think it was a good decision for me to leave the server
on wednesday, that's why dragonite asked how i was
was rainy creeping you out?
she too nice to me now üò£
sis*
on duty
shepherdess
for some reason the idea of gummy being a shepherd is way funnier than the idea of ida being a shepherd
whichever
you wouldn't be entirely wrong gummy
one would say enough to drive you insane
remember that one time ida described how you have to grab the rams by their horns to make them go where you want them to go, or something?
gummy
hey i frighten easy as well
they're terrified of humans
good idea
plus i am clumsy and will end up hurting myself in a way
and also they were probably used to humans because they were owned by an old guy who was like "two euros and you can give them food and pet them for as long as you like"
i'd pay at least eight and a half dollars to see that
hey maybe you can herd her bunny instead
i would do it
if you can come up with a more creative name
since that is her real name yeah lol
i didn't know
ha no one calls me by real name
flubs name is steven
the army of ste
a decent amount of people know my name by now
sis's name is charlotte
and also i sort of imagine he spent a lot of time smoking weed
nope the opposite actually
well still dont make drugs at yourself because two wrongs dont make a right
im trying to download this platinum emulator
brb shower probably
1.37 miles
one person said i ran fast
and an elderly couple i ran pass pretty sure thought i was crazy
so just wait for me to kick it and then ill get right on that
noooooooooooooo
running with a backpack on is very taxing
i dont think its going to be march, it's cold in march
why are you bothering with whatever month is coming up
13th in 2015
schleep.
gummy is merciful.
i dislike math personally.
nice.
wish me luck
wrong history
dude good luck
hell yea
i already did i love that channel to death
im trying to sleep
i want chipotle right now
even though never seen one
neither did i.
i want arbys
yooo 97% on the history final
hey chuck
gimme ground beef
hey it looks like patricks legs
it looks like a butt
you need to try harder
flubs tonight
gummy those two teams are parts of so many sports now
league of legends
shots fired
kek.
now flubs needs to song
i think for everyones sake i need to not do that
too small
eat it
you are making me hungry
im making myself hungry lmao
crispy chicken burger
i gotta think of good math emotes then
sure
im working on new emotes here
do it
star
so no xkcd 303?
hey i said limit to 2
no even a single star emote.
id make a bunny one but im feeling lazy
so flubs when are the fortnite videos returning?
like that will smith movie
i used to play mario kart wii out the ass in high school and then i didnt play it for like a year and when i came back it was like what are fingers
and thats why minecraft is the best game ever created
i hate that show
ooo gummyland raid
can't remember her actually banning anyone, but ok.
anyone from a raid.
i wish i'd remembered that trick during the recording but oh well
just barely annoying enough to not get a new one
when stuff expires it just gets worse at doing what it does. milk tastes worse, meat makes your body explode from disease, etc
flubs stop hitting on uni students
we're both made of atoms so sure
yeah but dont you run him on a pi
and thats made of atoms and shit
time to see salty people
time to see if its been uploaded to the internet yet
of course they are
i hate game of thrones
sooo when will walking dead end?
don't you also hate that show?
what?
wow a lot will end in 2019
besides iw
oh 100%
and what have you seen so far?
maybe
it was many moons ago
jake paul is trending
reason why is because he wants to stop cyberbullying....
i think i remember a disproportionate number of people being classic internet condescending pricks to him over something undoubtedly small
i forget does the internet like or hate boogie now
and drago it's funny
boom roasted!
gummy beat him to it so gummy gets the point
how will i function?
i need someone to remind me not to do something stupid everyday
i suppose you could return an array or an object containing multiple values if you want
cone of shame
good!
have some more
gotta spice things up
you post a pizza picture then
great
flubs can i borrow $999 for this?
noooo
you can borrow $999 for a big pizza though
how big?
so big it costs 1000 dollars
"$1,000 pizza sold at nino‚Äôs restaurant in nyc features caviar, lobster"
thats all i know
its fish eggs
its also fake rich person food
now thats something i would do
*getting* money makes people evil. money is great
luckily thatll never happen so we're good
god if my metabolism ever slowed down id be such a fatass
lol why is that even a roll
probably some yogurt idk
ooo pc givaway flubs
might as well just replace my pc for this...
o k fine
that was it
darn
and try not to over work yourself
keep up with your strength
been trying to drink water and fruit juice
so you don't overwork yourself
sleep is proving to be more difficult
because if you can't sleep, try to relax and clear your mind
and it did nothing
last time i had one was in 2015 and i caught it right after going through the college of winterhold quest, and to this day i feel queasy when playing the college of winterhold quest
ah, pavlovan conditioning
happened when i was in elementary school too
tbh i should sleep as well soon
go sleep
drago go sleep
fine lets explore the city instead
alright i will add all of those
sup peeps
hai there gumbotron
pretty good
can i have some
dark?
what do yall think of this picture of me
yes that is my leg but thats irrelevent
aww thans
i know right
<:wat:579563576914870333>
watch it flubs
ayy 100 on my part 2 final for english
how many do you have now?
you don't need to replace the headset
im bored flubs
im talking a 45 second, big long yell. i cant even whisper that long
only slightly less photon-black-hole-ish
ah yea
flubs created the world
people are so dumb these days
either that or the universe is (essentially) flat and the world is curved
you are wearing shorts*
in which case go ahead
what happen was in animal crossing today, a fortune teller told me to wear shorts to avoid luck so i said on stream that i should take my pants off
when i wear shorts
in _may_
i call her crazy also though so it's okay
is she crazy?
i'm sure my mom must think that about me too
so my mom has had plenty of time to get used to it
6 more followers and if i can maintain 3 average views
though she got pissed off at me during the stream, mostly for fun
yeah
because i asked my viewers my starter pokemon
some other web sites would let you do that probably
she has work all week and weekend
so i think maybe an early morning animal crossing stream
her fiancee is michael from mandjtv
he apparently said to someone during a stream they should die a horrible death
yeah...worse than my pants joke
yeah.
there is still time for you to escape, starlight
i could be, for example, a gummy
lmfao
drago you are a gummy worm
but what do you expect from a guy that likes muskets?
the cane is only to be used for the betterment of society
then you can be an infinite number of triangles
and i dont know why i installed it in the first place
origin is a bad launcher
hmm i need to be in class in like ten minutes
kek.
i got 96 on the physics final woo
seems like my server now has a similar issue with that but instead of an account called the greatest, we have an account called ‚Äúflippy‚Äù
remember when you told me about the greatest account?
that they might be some server bot thing?
that might have been it
makes flubs a milkshake
kek.
though we need a replacement for the other 3
good after being sick
i'm trying to avoid dairy for now since it's not uh
star shush
that's nice of you.
well as long as you got sleep that is good
yea.
thats cute
drago
well real time sub counts
youtube crackin down on the channels that center around drama prolly lmao
i hate to say this because it's a very interesting system but i feel like socialblade isn't going to last regardless of what youtube does
true
they let you see the specs on your competition but other than that you just get so much more data from analytics
hey drag join freedom yet?
bunni that is not a bunny
i thought the same thing, gum.
you should tell the service about it.
hes not that crazy
thats true
so that's convenient
well i won't be leaving the resort, that's for sure
as soon as they were sitting near the fountain and pikachu told tim he knew his father would be proud
plus the bad guy...really, he meets the guy thats says his son is the bad guy...really...that early in the movie?
lets build a city for good purposes
and im really not, i just like streaming with my ex a lot
yeah i remember you saying that
which is why i'm never buying bits or subscribing to anyone
i mean isn't every site money grubbling?
and the culture on the site is so toxic and bleeds into so many other things
even if you can't sleep
i know facebook and youtube does the whole money grubbling things as well
and twitch also has this "here's a thing you can do to support your streamers but actually we take most of it"
is to directly donate???
bits and subs
but man these movies are so predictable
problem is i don't have anyone that i really like who streams/does youtube...
im finding an artist to commission a drawing for you
on youtube
but amazon is cool
grossest thing in the internet is dragonite
drago 1675
was creating this server not enough
this server isn't crazy
maybe you dont
and they died because the new person died?
and then she left
gummy now you see the problem
also demon lord
because isn't this place technically zeal?
well zeal was different for me
no this place isn't composed 30% of people who need to go out and see some sunshine
you could always have put it in the trash can
drago you donate
good news, i unlocked vip on twitch
yeah im not gonna risk it
and flubs how is this place better?
gummy
she actually knows how to entertain people
hes my everything etc etc
true believers
oh if no one knows, meet starlight, my head admin
it's awful someone even made it
yanis has conflict with you two sometimes
it gives me a headache
was yanis the one who sorta went into cardiac arrest when told him to stop thinking about things he hates for ten seconds
you never met yanis before drago
and he is french
floral was fun
yeah thats floral to you
i don't dislike him
that's terrifying
compost
your choice
babies
pay me
caffeine drago
wait you're giving me an artist?
have fun with that
but you might have hurt the spider's feelings
exactly
top kek.
was the most i had
kiddies
tonight i will stream for 10 secs at midnight
he's just in denial
im immortal
<:shrug:579725441099890689>
you gotta be careful of friction gummy
i mean she's probably just going to tell you to do it sustainably, too
she ain‚Äôt lewd
thank you sis
no yo udont
or transformers?
yay!
i see...
if you are ever asking if im biased
all right..
so i can announce my special day?
looooolll
but also good job
availability of stormy
but you should get a schedule. and a job. and friends. and other stuff
alright flubs
okay discord ruined that
yes it does
it sucks and i hate it?
i‚Äôll take that as an eh!
also ida something possessed me to poke through the hold tla roleplay today
in the usa they are
they're free in the us?
wanna help
gummy banner is done
my newspaper likes to advertise computers sometimes
plus i have ublock origin. lol.
that's already like a 3x better ad rate than on youtube videos
for watching ads
flubs what?
i'd subscribe to gummy.
the ones you watch for bits
those get around it. so you do still have to watch them
flubs can pick
flubs this is the worse time to sub to me
the worst*
you guys picked a horrible time to sub lol
also guys i have to admit something...
you're terrible at everything?
he cut school the day of the big math test
oh yeah hes a liar and a cheat
oh i made fake accounts on my forums
active
when ida and i had second accounts for the rp thread we'd go into the chatbox and yell at ourselves sometimes
right ida?
unfortunately the logs from the chatbox dont exist anymore, there were some gems in there
fun fact sis not stormy is the person who can calm me down the fastest
better than your banner drago!
becasue it'd ignite instantly
my banner has a reference to everything
does that count?
s is blue based on rarity's dress colour
no tiberia was me
he was crazy
are you going to tell the fishing pole story
maybe sylveon
drago went friendly
then he went super mean when zeal server was made
then when i left for first time he went friendly
flubs is weird where he loved me
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115>
kek.
i chased after a girl who was mean to me
star
isn't that worst?
so seems like our fights are better
yay!
which i need to make ding dongs joke
it's me, a boy
to the server of fun people
ooh canada boys
or more im not sure
demonlord and gummy are in the land of canada
lol yep
and i only learned about it today
my sleep schedule is jacked too
i like the new profile pic
or however you spell that, i don't keep track of pok√©mon much these days xd
you spelled it right lol
doing well besides feeling like i should be productive right now
cuba :o
convenience rocks
also there's a direct flight to there from where i live
yeah i've never been on a trip like that before so it should be fun
i've been barely out of the state let alone country lol
lol same
i've been to the us quite a few times, mostly just minnesota since i'm only 45 minutes away
last last summer i was *supposed* to travel, by car, to wisconsin but plans got cancelled and im still a travel virgin
didn't get to see the capital sadly lol
well we drove all the way to arkansas so i guess that kinda counts as going to a few states lol
alright i'll brb peoples
oh my this place talks without gummy starting the convo
welp
flubs is a jock
drago
yes i am
anyone who dies is dumb
and flubs
or turpentine
my sis protects gummy
fabulous
i have no work!
i dont know code but sure
i tried
drago sleep
im gonna attempts to stay up all night
remember he's like 7' 2" or however tall dragonites are
im small
am i tol or smol
thats not a pokemon
i thought yahoo was second most popular
interesting
the fuck
you can't talk to kevin
how did you even find that
me too
charlie knows how to make life hell for me
what he do?
wtf today is tuesday?
except he isnt really gentle, if he steps on your foot it fucking hurts
charlie doesnt slobber on me, im an expert of avoiding teh slobber
sure
alright sounds cool
hope charlie doesn‚Äôt eat me
nah he'll just howl at you from 10 feet away
gummy i have my own anti-charlie bible
bye charlie!
how much are they actually
youch
its cheaper to buy a pro controller then 2 joycons
$376 cad
it's a dinosaur
unless the graphics card is way underpowered and the botw people just did some insane black magic to make the game work. they probably did.
ive been waiting six years for my dragoniteite
or i could make drago mad saying im returning to youtube
are you really still stalking me
loopy or katsukity?
my loopy card actually still works it's just the 3ds itself thats on the fritz
he nearly murdered my balls when he threw me a pack of mambas
of course that server becomes pretty active when i'm asleep.
yes.
yes.
he's gentle 95% of the time
back in like 2006
those were the days
im worried about this now
if people give me money on twitch
youtube walkthroughs (plural) / let's play (singular)
shit
mhmm
i want honest truth?
it's simpler
i like both but the second one pleases my brain more
well, not symmetrical but you get what i mean
scroll up
remember the old days of camelot
actually i don‚Äôt remember much
i was?
it was you, master, and i
i don‚Äôt fully remember
lets try to make this the golden age again
dont try to recreate what has passed
thats a good idea
<:dan:579731005317971969>
we have all the people i want here
theres people
i think drago and i need to roast each other more
thats attitude
well there we go
the rules are there are no rules
well that sounds like fun
2 be nice
booo
i want pancakes
ugh i got a busy day tomorrow
congratulations!
i wanna play in the snow sis
i like how we're two days away from june and idaland still has snow
yes drago we too nice now
thats the only thing i didn't change
well flubs, the guy is on meds now and plus if i ban him i might be responsible for a suicide
i have a cool mnemonic to remember this kind of thing
if it is your mental state you are responsible for it. if it isn't you aren't
and people are generally more active
all the mods who well didn‚Äôt work or gone
youre not his mom
if you spend your whole day watering your neighbors lawn, your lawn will remain unwatered
except for the part where he was being toxic and/or making the other humans in your server uncomfortable
team up against him
wow thats mean
we're still planning it
i demand to be invited!
will!
nice nice
lol ^w^
<:wat:579563576914870333>
the shapes are bigger and closer
top kek.
my game boy player start up disc finally arrived!
a what now?
the morning hours are an amazing time of introspective awakening
it came out after the ds
well flubs
i like cookies and milk
with the native americans
muy interesante
what's that
ya boy may or may not have pulled another all nighter
operation stupid is starting
also this bus smells like piss
yummy
i forget why i got a 3ds xl instead of a 2ds xl
which one?
thanks
she said it‚Äôs better to save money and wait till i have an income before i spend
or else i might go on a spending spree
and no way im taking my capture card 3ds around
probably
99% think corphish and his gf broke up
he already hinted something if you are around his twitter, plus i can tell by the way he acts, he's borderline depressed
yeah i dug around his twitter
but i can tell they both aren't on each other's description
rainy and eyan seem to last
rainy and eyan have the most sixth-grader relationship ive ever seen and i love it
and i hate it
yes but how much
a lot
rawr
hey it was made in 2014
the one where i got accepted into rpm network when i was a senior in high school and then like a month later youtube was like hey, you dont need an mcn to be partnered anymore
i dont remember so, no
lmao
sort of in the same way that having all of your legs amputated sounds fun
you shed a little bit of weight but on the other hand holy crap you dont have any more legs
i remember my first thumbnail was in paint
whyd rago
why drago
someone told me to
the hell
ive always assumed it was your upbringing but it could always just be your basic nature
because your skill is susceptible to breakage under immense force
thats even worse
drago screw you
all right so since he's not answering i'll just tell bunni that flubs is the robot
i'm not dead :o lol
i feel deeply offended
haven't streamed for a week rip lol
last surprise? lol
they added a handful of songs
welcome person lol ^w^
when's my birthday gummy? lol
im just playing smash bros
ive had so many cats
i have 2 currently
adorable kitty <3 lol
"easy"
*has no life* lol xd
me neither lol
yay!
yeah i think it took almost a week for my first emote but 2 or 3 days for my second one
i'mma be leaving the vc too.
have fun lol ^w^
lol xd
a cool person? lol
ooh lol
heard worse lol
send link please? lol
they're totally not screenshots and stuff <:bsdderp:584676007664156675>
holy guacamole
quote of the day in another server. you'll know when you see it lol
oooo
much better than chrome.
flubs you missed a big vc here yesterday
also bunni was there and she doesn't sound like a robot
so i'm very grateful for that
the one night i go to bed before midnight lol
rip lol
i should do it
i wanna see what's on /r/calculus now
welp reddit just died for me
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115>
feel free to vote multiple
i was streaming this morning
i was probably asleep then lol
nice lol ^w^
i love how rarely anyone promotes their stuff in this server
she has the personality to keep my stream alive
when this server is made for self promo
here is an example
indeed.
<:bsdderp:584676007664156675>
a danganronpa character
that too
everyone is gay
you're a girl?
hey gummy wanna go out on friday?
back off, she's mine.
it‚Äôs a good meme
the switch will release most wii u games
gummy, you can give me your wii u.
i don‚Äôt have one
even if you get one for free
wii had even more great games.
oh it also had mario mak - oh wait
which nobody played
because ive been too busy using my wii u as capture scaffolding for wii games
but i also dont feel like spending money
sounds like war music
obligatory
so drago
thats a short game
there
i typed dragonitespam banner
i know
booo
note that it does not have a due date
gummy stop reading my notes
and my sis is on this server
i realized everyone that works for me is an asshole, an idiot, or a bootlicker
i honestly cant tell which of the three is worse
without question
or an asshole
but are we friends though?
or sis depends who wants to hang out with me on my bday
because im amazing
who esle is excited for a new season of black mirror
milk expiring is like the death of a loved one you monster
or you put it on craigslist and ship them a brick with an image of your junk taped on it
i try not to
all the first male flubses are named mike
idk somewhere upstate probablyu
well i want gummy relatives
you wouldnt like being a flubs
sis nooo!
wanna actually be related to me sis? ~~i can hook you up with one of my french cousins~~
they seem to have one thing in common with me
i got cousins
i hurt my hand carrying a chair
sooo the guy who looks like drago who is depressed showed me his prom pics
you know the one in zeal
and is getting depressed since the girl didn't want more
booo
i mean i did reach out to him back when he was really depressed back in zeal
late bunni?
like right now?
sure i can wait
i can't stay up too late either
i dont want to deal with myself
that should say it all
yeah but he had memes in the way r/frenworld has memes
shall i play ranked game and hope i be done
i didn't want bringina to see since she and i joke about essay a lot
yall is plural so it woild be more correct to say yall are weird _gummies_
for everyone especially bringina to see
bringina has never seen my grumpy side and i hope she never does
no flubs that what gummy and i so
only a few times
on second thought this sounds like a lot of effort
and like 1/3 of the population speaks english but the other 2/3 yell
that time
i miss them
invite the uncle
go to sleep gummy. listen to ida.
well now someone has to use kissing booth then all channels will be used
superyummying.
very minimal amount of fat too
yea i don't either, i like a little because when you cook it it renders down and makes even juicier
i like but hate food
still up?
i mean it was kinda obvious but not
what subjects?
all people are garbage
physics and us history
here i am still not even close lmao
managed to get level one on my server with nitro boosting
my server invite is like....
welp need to get on pc first
and i didn't want her to see me angry like this
im considering something stupid
of money
and if you sold mario 3d world with it you could probably get a fair bit
does this server need boosting?
my pc doesnt need specs
im too cheap to buy a web cam
but i managed to take 100% of it
no drago
thought you own one
my sister has a wii u game so in order to sell everything
no my cpu isn‚Äôt twice
it‚Äôs just the full power supply
well guys
why both we have all the stuff we need
well this server doesn‚Äôt have nitro people besides me and sis
i doubt zeal has any either
so on average you're ordinary
average isn't median
that is to him what xkcd 303 is to me
next tuesday i get the best haircut of all time and im so pumped
oh you know what maybe you can do this
kugal i will pay for your haircut if you do that
done
i didnt see anythign would be a lie
shhhhhh
im reading 50 shades of drago
good job
that is good
do i even want context for the line "50 shades of flubs"
either that or 49 pages of me crying and one of me masturbating *while* crying
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115> <:revolver:582671595235966976>
flubs i thought you never cry
drago
how dare he get a switch
i have a new 2ds so screw that
the screen protectors do not need a firmware update
well flubs
god damn it
oooh, ad astra looks sick af
no i mean no he cant have it
guys
youtube is going through another adpocolypse
if i got the news then yeah many have
i don‚Äôt want a new one since i will upgrade a lot next year
hmmm
send it here
could also be a final fantasy game though
sometimes i confused my left with my right and it makes me feel like a special kind of stupid
i know it has to be ddr3
so that's the part of your brain that got retrofitted as a space to store extra calculus
actually the same
i can never remember what's left and what's right
oh you know what else i do?
those are a l classic six day a week moment kugal
i picture a piano to remember the difference between left and right
one time my mom accidentally put chocolate milk syrup on my waffles when she was on autopilot
see at least thats sugar on sugar
let's go with acid
stress, some other issues, and i was soaking wet leaving my university today because it rained hard
i've been feeling the weirdest mix of guilt from being off of school
there's just something satisfying about going places in the rain
i like it when its a light sprinkle
like did you tell em your dog ate your hw
pc3-12800 ddr3 1600
drago is about to part with some first edition ddr100 ram and he doesnt even know it
pic pls
i should do some research
a very weird part of me wants to cut mine short
and yet i'm still probably gonna do it. i'm a fool
get out of here with your proverbs ya nerd
got em
gummy is that you?
speaking of money i just paid a $360 fee to my college for calc 3
oh right
i dont believe in mornings
kugal
gummy why do you have a petri dish in a pizza box
and the year skyrim came out
but it‚Äôs giving me a stomachache
nice
so did zeal server get boosted?
i am very confused right now
anyone wanna share these cookies and milk with me
they're yummy
did you finally buy one of those sheep from ida or something?
the lady
you don't need to, you already have a cool accent
it may work or it may fry my pc
nice!
probably more like 25, since it's not shiny and new, as if that matters for ram
also i feel like i didnt hear _anybody_ speculating about emile playing chrono trigger until like, three days ago
on twitter they were
i thought he would be
same
and beat drago in yt once again
like, the entirety of it
is that your sister?
some moron destroyed my gummyland poll
and they didnt invite me?
i had it set to check ip
which option did they vote for?
so guys
who wants to bet chuggaaconroy dies after 20 episodes?
some of those bosses can be rough
i havent done that since december
yall are clearly playing a different isaac because i thoguht it was the most boring thing ever
well tell him to do them fast because im busy tonight
i'll bundle it with the ram
do you want my pc fried drago?
give it to blitz
sis is watching this in the background knowing i lost too many brain cells
even more treason
which one?
one of them has cleaner lines
the other seems like it's got tv static in the background
i like the top one too
thanks
it's cool to see another him doing another non nintendo game
kiddies
i thought that was just an urban legend
well shoot
reason being is gummyland is too self center towards me
if you want a server all about me well you are in it currently
though then drago took over
alright so this server is basically what i intended gummyland to be back then
that being said, feel free to invite who you want here, rules are strict but no nsfw pics and stuff, you can kinda talk about nsfw stuff depending on what it is but no pics
also no bullying people or swimming
no nsfw pictures
and most but not all do have mod powers here
god fucking damn it
if server changes name
i have to change everything
i saw a really good tweet recently lemme try to dig it up
guys
only reason streams are alive is because stormy gives me a nudge to stream
i never promote it here so idk how people know
i just ignore them 9 times out of 10 so i miss most streams
my sample size is uh
or its larger than that but their brain cell count isnt
listen flubs
i dotn mind if youre straight
kugal let'
s be nice to flubs
have you even _seen_ my posture
or however you spell
gummy youre hereby banned from your own land
can i have money
so demon is (straight)^0
so heteromantic would be accurate
that reminds me this happened yesterday
```[11:48 am] dragonite - guru of life: i had a dream that i was having a philosophical conversation with a girl i used to like and now i cant remember what the conversation was about```
burning questions
i hear that
talk to you weirdos later
he was always in a bad mood
interesting statistic: one in twelve people are born without a soul
who am i kidding no i wouldnt
ask my sis out
thats easy
and congrats
do i need it to be the same brand of ram?
someone get him hes getting away
so ida real quick, which of the two of us would enjoy asking the other out the least
i realize i'm probably just making this even worse for myself
nvm i forgot that one guy
(„Å£‚óï‚Äø‚óï)„Å£?
hehehehe
yes ma'am
youve streamed league?
gummy seems like he would be about 40% better to be around if you were completely fucking wasted
eyan's playing my champion
weirdly close to installing ffxiv
imma get to level 71
i'm way ahead of you, i've gotten three classes to level 70 and i'm still completely incompetent
then it'll be 80
it's free for the first month or something right?
i should probably also re-install eso now that i have the hard drive space for it
sounds easy enought
clearly it's called "read"
on mid-atlantic united states internet
my email is not in the system
the system requirements page says 40 gb though
i see
weird game
and there is a way to raise chocobos
that game sounds confusing
like i genuinely feel ill being there
sign me up
all right now the 25 gb download begins
cool
~~how gay does she sound~~
it finally installed
oh my
ill refrain from sending you a screenshot
youll see later anyway
oh for god's sake
im making this gta 5
urgh i basically made her my rp character because im uncreative and making her last name "prima" would be very incorrect but it also sounds the most normal
guess i could just fish up a last name that doesn't suck
wait am i not allowed to strafe
what nonsense is this
okay hold mouse to strafe, i can live with that
also flubs
then you should stream animal crossing
no drago
just six days a week
the seventh day starts on sunday and ends on saturday
alright
can you have an odd number of ram sticks? ive never thought about doing that
you can have one
im pretty sure you can have like three if you have the slots, and they dont even need to be of the same size
i put an extra 256(?) mb in my computer (previously 1024 mb) in 2009 and im pretty sure it worked and thought it was the coolest thing ever
but i have borderline ocd
this was me two weeks ago
looks like me playing dishonored 2 on minimum settings lmao
im coming back on youtube drago
drago those are flubs‚Äôs panrs
so we don‚Äôt have a mailbox
that‚Äôs on flubs for not protecting me
god damn it sis
you humiliate yourself, i just laugh at the results
also the message didnt mention you by name did it
<:stpc_ppwhatdidyousay:480683452933472276>
i know
damn i can‚Äôt beat you in anyway
cure me and my morals
there now we have the three stooges role
hi, gum.
mission complete now to get food because im always hungry
nice.
how you know?
i love french fries.
because that's what you always go for.
i hate everything
wait really?
üéâ now your computer is up to 1980s standards
i kinda regret not just building a new one tbh
well..
yes but with the rack for the drives and the ginormigantuan 1080 and the 0 working case fans it doesnt have great airflow
i still cant get the image of superman's decked out rgb pc  out of my head whneever oyu mention it
actually it's 903.11 united states dollar
its like something one of my dumbass cousins would buy lol
that is enough pc upgrades for this year hopefully
well a potato can generate electricity under certain circumstances
we're havin steak and roasted potatoes tonight hell yea
the potato can be quite violent though
lets do the lower quality rivalry
do not anger the potatoes
unless provoked
no not yet, very soon though
and i prefer the more general term "vegetable" thank you
flubs he's saying you dont get enough exercise
gummy dont tell him what he cant do
i did not expect that answer
you only play golf with others if someone has an ulterior motive
mmmmhmmmm
who is that?
it was an on going joke that chewy and i were dating
invite him here if you want
so i can see if i can remember
do any of you people know what im talking about in gummyland?
kendall and i aren't even watching the chat
its the rail on train tracks that murders people who touch it
i like subways
it's whatever
same
everything is whatever \:d
i dont know half the people here
we should vc again soon
oh electricity
i was calling it fast juice because i forgot the word
i'll hit y'all up later
my mom thought it was cute of me to have cookies and milk the other night
gummy get out of bed and go play outside
gummy get out of bed and go for a walk
fine i‚Äôll do the get out of bed part
it's good for you
thats too much
oh she changed it i don‚Äôt have to match anymore
another one in my server got banned in manechat <:facehoof:241025290875174912>
but what got him banned was
he‚Äôs not ban in my server but he pisses me off
if it's just you you can still tell him to screw off but it'll be easier if it's everyone
is threatening to kill people who dont exist bad? i mean i know its really sad to watch but is it anything beyond that?
is that code
oh so it was for being a butthole mostly. thats valid
everytime someone wanted to discuss about a villains
and it‚Äôs a cartoon so if villains get redeemed so what?
flubs wanna watch some care bears with me?
i rather mod flubs than him there
the evil care bear that wants to destroy the upper class care bears
well the user account was from another country but still
"we're not strangers, im your fan"
i was gonna say lmao
sos man, she must think really highly of you
aaaaaand grandmas asleep again
is there a reason a disproportionate amount of bronies are batshit crazy?
not all, but a bunch more than youd expect
i know a bunch who are normal
yeah thats probably a big part of it. also the internet makes people weirder so thats probably a factor
i'm not a mod in eimm
probably won't be tbh
so i'm not exactly the perfect candidate
you clearly don't read the graveyard channel
$11.60
like _actually_ mad
he doesnt count he argued with _everyone_
long gone
gummy that was like two years ago you should probably let it go at some point
why not? its like zeal but without any of the annoying people like gummy drago and master
even though im right here
actually i haven‚Äôt done anything crazy irl lately
i kind of like this place tbh, it feels pretty chill
zeal is weird
~~ida you didn‚Äôt even wanna join in the first place~~
the people who talk in zeal are just extraordinary enough for me to notice but not enough for me to be alarmed
except rainy
he threaten me to many times
yes flubs?
eh, i'm good
anyways as for gummyland seems like conversations can start without me but earlier morning and it needs to have right people
but that might be because of the gay agenda
necro?
yeah
because he's donated so much
im pretty sure rainys actually really nice she just wouldnt be caught dead showing it
technically demon lord is the royal treasury im gummyland but he needs to hit the $100k mark
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
candyman makes me nervous ngl
what shall i say it?
just you know more errr
explosive?
and probably sexist
won‚Äôt be a long stream but yeah
yeeeeeah
some jokes i think are okay
sexism and racist jokes aren‚Äôt okay
god damn it
i just checked
he is still banned
my cou try sucks
and plus if you ban him
but let's not get political
they can't ban them though since those tweets will be in the national archives
they can
there would just be consequences
plus jack dorsey apparently is mutual followers with a bunch of white supremecists so it's not like he wants to anyway
and lgbt stuff should not be consider political stuff
ida point to one time in history when that was the case
i feel like that would spark the renaissance faster though
also fuck the romans
as crazy as that is but yeah
i don't like spices, i'm white
does yt not realize how long animation takes?
gummy how many youtube channels have you made now?
i have about 5 more
and streaming is worth it
nah man its cool
i am also not banning people who are right unless they do something
we don't need to, i got it handle
gummy the baboon must be studied
yeah that's uh
that was your advice drago
idk why people want him gone
hmm bring sis in to chew him out then ban?
i doubt mods mind someone like that being banned
and spices yum
no not that
```[2:48 pm] dragonite: free speech doesnt mean everybody else doesn't have the right to tell you to shut your pie hole```
i forgot
like time out chair or bad boy corner
no one is seeing this
lol drago
too bad i can't give you the honours to ban
what opponents?
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
like why we drive on parkways and park on driveways
and what even is the whole unmotivated thing as abstruse locution what/
ahahaha
or why it's called taking a dump while you're leaving it behind
yanis is up
turns out
deeo
and frencg
you think that's a lot?
are you sure youre a gummy bear and not a marshmallow? people sure seem hellbent on roasting you
here is a glimpse of people being banned
like theres a 100% chance thats all he has to do today
>keeping you here a bit more because you're calling me "baby"
yanis is great, but hes 15 so expect arrogance from him
ask him if it was a straight pride rally, a milo rally or a kkk rally
i wanna know what a degenerate rally looks like in person but the more bodies show up the better it looks for _them,_ plus i wouldnt be caught dead at a kkk rally
we can stop mass shootings in america by telling all the rednecks that mass is an si unit which pounds technically arent
yeah then they'd just go to - i'm not even going to make that joke it makes me sad just thinking about it
and the people doing mass shootings dont seem like the tolerant type who want a bunch of no good [insert minority] filling up their heaven
holy shit this server has never been this active since last year
if only the churches that are everywhere did psa's like that
this video is wonderful
im not ruthless
i dont hold it against ya :p
i know you
aren‚Äôt you that guy
i mean i used to play csgo but i had to stop cuz everytime i got headshot and heard that noise i would begin to shake and shitit
i hate saying it
this is a christian server we need more foul language in here
i mean ive had it but like its not like i do it every day xd
wait no thats fowl language
yesh
and make him feel very uncomfortable
nope, changed direction and is going the other way
good one
its still not that bad
perhaps you are approaching this from the wrong angle
this is like the upper atmosphere of flubs
oh by the way you have great taste in profile picture
gyro is my favorite character in all of manga to this day
no one has taken that spot
there are people out there who wont even be thought of a week after their dead and the chance youre one of them is much higher than youd think
so i did it
growing numb to pain is the shit my dude
üèì üéæ üèì
oh the i and a are in the opposite order
thats dumb
the next session is scheduled for 4:30 so youd better hurry up
you missed some great quotes
bringina: "local dictator takes a part time job at cafe, villages hope they dont get poisoned"
whats the context even
dont be so harsh on yourself flubs
im not an expert but i understand it. you cook it a bit then munch on it then digest it
who is big brian
i meant big brain
but i dont know what the third one is
kugal don't be ridiculous
thats a bit too much salt
yes they have similar designs
and eyes
thats me when i lose my temper
but i usually flip something
guys
it was _amazing_
welp
i don't keep up
also the guy who threatened to kill mlp villains is banned for 3 months on manechat flubs
i mean in gummyland
well it is very salty
since you say anything that doesn't seem right and get jumped on
i see
a friend of my mom said i look friendly
i fuckin love just dance
keep in mind im incapable of being serious so probably
leaving zeal
i was only in it for the convienence of not changing my muscle memory but i found a way around it without the random pings
i mean im the one who went through with it so yeah
i‚Äôll sue you flubs
after i make you breakfast
man sis..people that are in eimm are scarier and colder than you
thats probably what caused the stomach pains
demon lord, how big is the sun and moon, not ultra sun and moon aftergame?
alright i‚Äôll see what i can prepare
quick and painful
worst is clearly slow and painful. its not fun
they fuckin dead
lots of guys like that are not nice
plus they werent big on regulations in the 1500s
gummy they have anopheles there
i sense a market niche that needs to be filled
and have a constitutional monarchy
normally i'd yell at you but that might actually be _less_ suck
no thanks
is that the company discord had a random big investment from?
i watched some of his videos and he seemed a lot less unbiased than he would want one to think
but he's nothing like that now
highly doubt it
this all started with vox and steven crowder
they _can_
they probably wont unless they fire like all of their pr people
they can't censor right leaning people
and hateful stuff
thats a problem...
we can't get mad at each other anymore
we need to gang up on someone else
though tbh...something about the old camelot days made it seem to be toxic
let's gang up on drago
i do gang up on myself
all in favour of getting rid of some channels/combining them?
i feel like self promotion and media should be combined
i guess media works for him
clear stuff up with stormy and hopefully be able to watch direct with her
yeah
prolly flubs then
time to **pun**ish him
screw you
kugal go to bed
blitz stop why beat me up? i was told you were nice over on this server
no puns allowed
regal if you catch kugal being nice you should put him in time-out
you should be
everyone's got the role that lets them screw with stuff
and it was gummy who said y‚Äôall were nice
well i did take hm out on several pizza dates so
kugal why do you have to be such a great person
wow, amazing you'd go out of your way to compliment strangers, props for spreading positivity
well tell them that they did a screwing good job
that is not cute sorry dragon i gay so nude pics of men not my thing
wait what
wish i'd known about that sooner
hell yea
oh boy
no regal we're not contagious i swear!
i think i see a business opportunity
heck yes
dang it's worse than i thought
hamster üòÆ
actually yeah i love weird stuff so
bunnies are **bun**dles of bun and fun, hun
dang
i dont like you
it‚Äôs a puppy dragon
congratulations on finding a computer case that costs more than my entire computer
doggggoooo
i‚Äôll be back tomorrow but i need youtube to send me off to sleep world
see ya regel
i‚Äôll show up maybe dragon
maybe perhaps perhaby mayhaps
mmkay im signin off nighty yall
this is forbidden
animal crossing
not 2019
i don‚Äôt wanna post anything if you haven‚Äôt seen it
all trailers are now in <#563455726048247808>
because you want my money or you want me to talk
how so gummy?
i'm a bit surprised they're delaying it
i knew it will be a big game
if it was a copy paste from new leaf like how city folk was to wild world
but can i do exactly the same thing every day forever?
but i prefer art from oot and mm
nooo regal
i never said zelda games were garbage
new evolution not great but i obsessed with the new legendaries they my kin lol
it's setup as a joke rgal
huh uh
then big movie
okay i have officially watched drago‚Äôs selling out video
omggg
not that ive seen
i love kiki
flubs you are adopted as well
flubs wtf is this
but i want superman to visit me
and hes one of those shitty ones that stopped caring years ago so youre awkward and they dont even really care
did someone actually take me?
because im currently having a side effect
trying to
well you might be right flubs
i know you like hi
nothing much regal
one percent of the time lol
he can‚Äôt annoy me trust me
i am immune
other fave sis*
she just can‚Äôt know i choose favourites
thursday is known as my bad luck day
bud tomorrow aint thursday
june 12, and 13 are bad days for me
i going to the beach tommorow
cant ur broke like me
thelastsane is crazy
harassed me under anthony‚Äôs orders
good times
i don‚Äôt like too peaceful
also some cool people
devent
(i did not just say that because both of my sisters love black and white)
plasma in back and white was cool
btw demon lord tell me again
i asked you this since 2018??
oh you missed the stream today
oh yeah i was out probably
though some of the social features are locked
spoilers!
stormy likes it and having stormy around is very nice plus i never played those games
not sure how much of a zelda fan she is
not sure if they were in the later games but yeah, she wouldn't be wrong there
sorry kay kay
showers with short hair are a breeze holy shit
skarm you didn't need to share that okay
see the shit we have to deal with?
my backs already destroyed so, come at me bitch
oh ok bye skarm
didnt know you went to school
i mean
i mean, ill give it
but it gets the job done
drago is leaving, very quickly
threesome?
that game isn't even all that awesome.
they are there to make money
makes sense, i guess.
your face aint free
you aren‚Äôt free
i didn't feel like installing it anyway
ive had worse
isn't that like super spicy?
im a bit jumpy today and will be a lot jumpy tomorrow
charlie is yelling at me becuase i wont give him my friend's number
yes it's 555-5555-555-5-5
thanks i'll just - hey wait the four-digit block is supposed to be the third one, not the second one
oh boy
june 13th
tomorrow?
not thursday lol
every year but last year
he doesnt even remember
or shortly before
lmao
due to skullkidfan being in the middle of it
i hear she has resurfaced
gossip amirite
how bout that
he didn't like it
and something about an old friend coming abck
he seems..better??
and that the ratings pisses him off
eh idc
"but drago you asked out that one girl from high school four years after graduation"
fricking i hate her after i re read our old msgs
bella's nice
even though she was mad at me one time for not knowing how babies were made
same honesly
i think that stupid crush on bella was what screwed me over
she always said i was like a little brother to her
i will read that book
a lot of drama
i'd dredge up another clip from something i recorded but i dont feel like opening premiere
hey, i wasnt even paying attention, what was that for?
blitz was already punching the shit outta gummy when the gun was shot
who's rob
i see a rob
i only have like five dollars on me
nice
i know a good rob
appreciate it xd
no jk
will smith or wont smith
coming from him that's basically i love you
what?
no swimming allow here
sleep
i will get lillie bot working skarm
1.1 million
soon enough they'll just re-release old gens as like an "pokemon remastered" or whatever
sleep bye
dont let the bed bugs bite
alright blitzypoo
to the battlefield!
oh good, i have time
muskets
march to the battle
fire!
i play so many games
pour a bit in the pan
i need a detailed step by step process, mla, 12 point font
ram that bullet down
fuck yes
no way
not pour the powder in separately
crazy
and this is what they are stored in
and the circle thing is the bullet
i didnt even know i was hired
fine
ive had weird drea,s
too many to count
tbh when are dreams ever normal
caught her with her ball mid yawn
thank god
i cant wait for pokemon fork and spoon
well.
but it's only thursday the 13th.
that was 2015
someone took control over it
yeah it was no fun
who took control over it?
i wonder if you even know him personally.
though these days we grew up so it‚Äôs like
‚Äúyoo gummy! everyone say hi to gummy, we met a long time ago when i had 10 subs‚Äù
yea how many subs does he have
i dont think i've ever formally met him but good for him
he‚Äôs cool these days
it'd be different if you badgered him to do it
you don‚Äôt stream
to be fair, to my knowledge, nearly 100% of people in here are your friend lol
that place is haunted for sure
theres fewer people and they are on average better
i just made my profile picture this in honor of pride month
plus i like the colors lol
also, all i did was ask why theres a d in fridge
"the other guy took more"
i see. kek.
but mostly ace
but nope.
yay!
oh really?
pretty much
so you can appear asexual but its just that you only like those you know exceptionally well basically
~~that's kinda gay~~
i had no wifi for like 5 minutes
what i miss?
we're all gay gum
that too
i wouldn't really want to have sex with a man.
are we human?
people went from wanting to get away from me to closer to me
(but honestly i wouldn't have an issue with making out with someone cute, but i would have an issue with bedding them cause that's terrifying)
(the thought of bedding with them is terrifying)
(depends)
(wait, no)
oh finally
needs more beige
i have a habit of oversleepign from how comfy it is
i tend to be grumpy during this day
well yeah
minecraft
stormy's outro today was funny
im just tighter with everyone here
you and stormy were bickering over what to stream
in zeal i almost have nothing to talk about
same
talk to drago, he is there...i think
blitz do you blow?
its ok we've been on several pizza dates
alright i'll be back i have doggo chores to take care of
going for walks is too tiring pretty much
yes but he already knows im in power
though tbh he could overpower me now. dont tell him
benny, wanna lead a revolution?
new pic of him pls
pls don't burn this place down
omg so cuuuuuuute
i dont know if we're ready for that amount of beauty yet
true
plot twist flubs is a girl all along
i see
i had this hung up my wall for a long time
(rest of the server besides flubs and blitz peeks in and says "yup, gummy lost his marbles")
i have butterbeer
from harry potter
it's basically cream soda with yellow food color
ida wanna play ffxiv yet
didn‚Äôt work
tbh it sounds like a scam
oh yea and thats another reason why i like being here so much more
my parents just got home so i get to go hang with them in a bit and kick it live
been busy
later on you start going to a lot of funerals
im cry at my chicken'a funeral
sad sure but not like crying sad
we have 14 chickens
theme park world
he just got very sick all of a sudden
dont tell my dad though
same with our doggo that one year
she just got so sick one weekend and it was time
u watch stephenplays? i knew i liked you
it's great if you enjoy him, i'm just giving my opinion that's all
regal isn‚Äôt trust me
all right
i'm sure a lot of stephen's fans are quite passionate about him
water or grass pok√©mon?
grass
same
good
prob asleep
mine is horrid
so ida lives in iceland and operates on new york time, and drago lives in new york time and operates on california time
he‚Äôll still be on the game
you don‚Äôt play that game
guys guys
pizza and wings
oh there will be
oh shit i just got it
i didnt know those wrist bands that absorb sweat are supposed to be used so you have em on your wrist so you can wipe your forehead until some tweet pointed it out
not that kind
"it sucks and i hate it"
your face is a drago opinion on twitter
your pokemon thing
too many pokemon anyways
hey man no declaring war on the flubs
i will shoot you. no invading flubs for resources
what are you gonna do? sic benny on me?
well im also hungry and need more food
youre the one that lives here
new favorite flavor
nani
can i have some?
i should be studying but im playing pokemon
was wondering if you were up for league?
yeah.
i take it you guys are watching mlp together
ah lol
it's great
doesn't seem very biologically accurate
my brother was a big fan of tmnt way back
one of the best animated tv shows i've seen.
i like the 1987 version as well
that was a good one
lol that was reference in the lego batman movie
t!top
why are the kids in eggs
flubsology is the study of flubses. thats a horrible field
od horribly
ergo ily
exactly
which are made of math
math is math!
dragonite dont insult my absurdly large body
im not doing anything gross lol
lol yeah i remember first playing that game with my cousins
for yellee
there's charlie for ya
is probably one of the best mod choices i made
doesn‚Äôt care if you are a friend or not, when rules are broken he is strict about it
wtf how am i 6th?
yanis is a good mod. he silences people and thats funny
drago is very consistent. very consistently weird.
ah, will added it. forgot she liked it.
that's
fuck, ive been found out
he leaves it on a table and pokes the screen
are the stories referring to the same event?
the comments were very acab
its reddit's two ideologies, both of which are annoying as shit and very reductive
all cops are bad and all conservatives are bad
hi star
even though it‚Äôs not against the rules
kek.
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115> <:revolver:582671595235966976>
i only allow game news tbh
black and white instead of trying to do that soft reboot should have picked only a hand full of popular pokemon from past gens
when the game comes out itll be fun and most people wont give a shit that theres only some pokemon in it
nah most gens you can find plenty of pokemon or trade
like pikachu
no fucking way in hell they should have tried that
transfer i believe is gone
"in the newest zelda game, link will be paid dlc released 6 months after launch"
btw idk about you
botw has such a nice art style
it's my favourite game?
the only way botwo could be bad is if it relies too much on motion controls
honestly there are worse fates
imo its ok if its an option not mandatory
speaking of which i should probably open my bday present from you soon
i got things to do today
im still streaming
nice
strange
lol flubs btw there was a crazy hippie at the beach the other day
i wanna be his friend
inappropriate? thats my kind of music
he also had a crazy husky dog which was super aggressive and it was p-u-s-s-y
it was also named dracula or something close to that
someone with multiple hips
i liked ss with motion controls
nah man im asleep
kugal quit it with the niceness its hurting my feelings
sounds fun
gummy
i just broke my chair
üòè sexy
well shit
nothing you could ever eat tastes as good as being healthy feels, but eating tastes good now and health feels good in 6 months - 10 years
im playing zoe
its the worst
gumym
gummy youre so smart it scares me
accurate though, demon
yeah he barks often its just quiet and high pitched
me too, if i eat fast food i have bad poopoos
teach that dog the word of the lord kugal
its too much of a coincidence between all of the cultures that they all predict an afterlife for there not to be something
probably doesnt lool
so everyone goes to hell since most religions need you to be of their religion to get into their heaven
all the gods are in a really big proxy war with their followers as puppet states
what if all the afterlives are mixed together into one big one, but you need to meet all the criteria to get it?
if the two gods are equal gummy, that means i have all the power of humanity - one weird crippled guy
am not religious but take me to church is one of me favorite songs
dont need to be religious to be unhappy tho üòé
even 20 years ago it would've been social suicide to say something like that
im intrigued
im not fully sold but ill try it
hell, all of us could be wrong, it could be something none of us can fathom
why die tho
ok done with my duolingo
i would vouch for it
you were pretty deep in the closet, you said to me that same thing one time, that being gay is bad
im pretty comfortable with my sexuality, im straight but bi curious ish i guess
go ahead
i dont think you should sterotype voices lol
im gonna head to bed fellas, have a good night
in vc
if you can das fine lol
hello i just got 11 hours of sleep
welcome to my world
you and me are like you and my sister, since we fight over nonsense most of the time, and ida's like my brother, who's usually looking on and going what the crap is wrong with you two
oh true
i will call sis to protect me from you
i'm 100% slavic.
flubs i will sue you
does this mean you will catch up on mlp?
i do that in bed silly
i bad at movies i try to finish it tonight maybe
ida i meant regal
whoops
can i be your third sister?
aren‚Äôt you a boy anyway koogul
maybe
what was the other core subject
as long as it involves math
im a boy, got the xy
if i could find a mate who was also a math boi i would die
will do drago
oh well that's good
good!
i too anti social for the pride parades lol
he's upping the pressure on me to get a girlfriend
you nerd
tell him that you agree and think you should be enrolled in more math classes
i like it
ive been thinking about what mine should be after dan
üòÆ aw shoot man
no it isn't
there's a whole day to go
so i have a game that i play for eight hours 3years ago and now i can‚Äôt find it? okay steam sure
im pretty sure when that happens the game poofs out of existence
interesting
great well least it was free
das good
at least i'll be making moola
too much purple
purple is one of the best colors, though.
leave it the way it was.
but if you want it that way then keep it becuase that's just my dumb opinion lmao
pink for sylveon
yeah
shhh
no stay dead
they watch
its ok if kids watch they'll be too pure to understand
iron_female
it‚Äôs actually a real thing
so what if others can see my nipples?
that's what she typed in anyway
because chemistry and biology
kugal shut up you would have done the same
rip my headphones they died
i meant hard to take care of
that's like asking a rock to be a rock
well i got news for you
you look stoned
drago 1, drago 0
if kugal taped puppet eyes to his face would he be a googaley koogally?
i would hold a calculus text book like youre holdin a skyrim book
but i dont know if i actually own a trash can lid
also gummy
maybe it is not us who is stoned, but gummy who is stoned
lol xd
why not?
stone
he's as tall as a skyscraper if not taller lol xd
i could probably murder someone with it in combat
guys charlie is sleeping right now and it's cute
even though it is one in the morning and bunny is probably sleep
that was my dad lmao
unless you are chugga who shouts
shouting is fine to an extent
and swearing..welll
it‚Äôs really bad that my server is one of the better ones out there
huge example one guy kept giving ownership to random people and getting it back then one day he lost it and got kicked
made a new server and did it again
im tired of your bs skarm
now has a brand new server
oh yeah
my favourite lec victory music
well no hes an independent being
kinky.
you are ambassador to gummyland here
lol it is
floral is the one who i like to call the cute little ball of anger
*thank* you
but story goes deeper
but yeah sorry to hear that
floral who knows tb is crazy
benny can be the cute little mop of anger
tb doesn‚Äôt like sex when being asked
but she broke up with him since he said no to sex
also since i wrote that i can never become the president of the united states
get a room
thonk
so ask benny what he wants to add to this server?
he said nothing but he glared at me
good good
it just broke
whyy
but he likes being howled at!
ive installed this app that my sister told me about that connects you to lgbt people and ive already got this 15 year old guy asking if we can be bfs lmao
also i had a dream that someone that got banned from gummyland just recently snuck in here and caused trouble
it wasnt a dream, that how i spent my morning
sure
how is your booty?
well flubs just buy me a drink first
i mean if a nuclear war was gonna start its probably pakistan and india but besides that and the class imbalance its great
president flubs
went to specialist to learn i just need more fiber
go ahead
damn
gummy knock it off
just finished the best game of bf4 ive ever played, 34-22
pupper üíñ
people are so interesting in their ways
dont worry i deleted the app again
i know right
oh no
that shit is disgusting
im pretty proud of myself
their singing was cringy
haaapppyyy birthhdaaay toooo youuuuuuu
aww gummy, doesnt that just make you smile? (:
then again, smile more, it looks good on you üòâ
thanks for the idea kugal
no singing on my bday pls
okay gummy fine you can have a happy birthday. but not too happy.
gummy you can have seventeed hours of happiness but after that it's $4.99 an hour
thanks sis and drago
it‚Äôs rain!!!
when taking pictures like this
you are 22 and im 19
and now we are both legal to drink in canada..
still
you should probably surrender now
gummy i challenge you to an orange juice chugging competition
apple juice pls
gummy
alright how about soda pop then?
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
yeah
hes like a young ida
thing is
okay i apologized to them
youre a bad judge of character
gummy you should hire me. i'm the best in my class at not listening.
right now drago
hes gone
for you yeah
im sorry for roasting you ida
that was bootiful
though they said i cannot take criticism
true
like if i tell you that your servers economic policy is backwards and rooted in your personal bias, thats good advice. if i tell you to be taller because you look like a troll at your current height, thats bad advice
gummy theyre nerds ignore their feelings
no i'm haunting his dreams until he dies
or that one fellow who has been mighty strange lately
hes *always* a massive twat
im so happy im on a new phone on a new plan
top ten pranks
it was just a prank bro calm down lol *dab*
damn thats a good pup
im offering free hugs to all
i did it
nothing
a nonexistent price to pay for salvation
ok üò¶
but when i stream animal crossing, all a sudden new viewers join and talk
and beat them with nets
implying my room has a lock
wait coke as in coca cola? or err.... cocaine?
only to be replaced by yanis
yeah
haters gon' hate hate hate hate hate
anyone who joins now will automatically get a role where they cannot embed links nor post pictures
now we're going to be back to the pre-2012 youtube spam.
hey you should all visit (remove the spaces)
freebuttz .com
a person who is called flippy keeps coming back with alts of the same name
gummy i am in need of free butts. mine has sprung a leak and i won't be able to sit down again until i can replace it.
i don‚Äôt get why zeal isn‚Äôt raided as much?
link is public
i thought you did drago
discord me is open
plus link is in the description of eyan‚Äôs videos
drago i only have burritos
you gotta fight benny for it
we should meditate on butts
be patient i was dropped on my head as an infant
i expect it to be delivered before yesterday at noon
fucking drinking i thought would be cool
it's not tasty for me.
that's what alcohol does.
also the withdrawls can kill you
alcohol is added in beer
drink with me drago
i don't need any more problems with my health, really..
but if you aren't, you're pretty sane.
gummy i think it's past your bedtime
<:wat:579563576914870333>
and a geek
im bored
it's raining
and all you have to do to move around in 3d space is multiply your current matrix with your updated transformation matrix!
just talked with my dad for like an hr so that was something
flubs are you wet?
how fun
either way i thought it look so good
nocturnal emissions are fun
i talked on the phone for an hr and 13 minutes
and that drained 7% of the battery
wow dude how could you
then their products sucked
now to stream animal crossing
wiat
because its fabulous
just some douche
he looks like el=vis
thats me lmao
it only has like 510 cameras
but yeah that'll be a bit later, gotta do a few things right now lol
i forgot what was it
oooh dayum
oh ok
gummy why i thought getting trolled was fun
here is the thing
it should.
as for floral...she keeps going back and forth on dating tb or not
this is like the most entertainment i had in years
ask them if they would like to collect tips
wait i actually need flubs
you will see embarrassing deaths
wait, no, they already made dumb n dumber
so flubs im going to steak place on monday
mine!
bitch lasagna
except for ham it doesnt look bad
drago, what do you have against ham?
here eat the lasagna
oh yeah the bot does that
ham is good
which i guess encompasses most pork
silly gummy died lol
but like ham and actual expensive pork is just blah
i've been eaten.
lets see only 8 wings
i forgot he existed
skarm gets two
shhh
who needs alcohol...when you got this
drago doesn‚Äôt get one
it's his favorite reason.
because he knows i'd haunt him until he dies
drago...no giving her ideas
nooo
doggo.
"keep the stupid deaths cummin gum"
not yet
gummy you missed the coin
then kill it
thonk
gummy keeps dying like a silly pants
when i did that stuff i was 16/17
til im a terrible friend
i give dragos 1.1
i had the best league game ever
i should have known that emile would get me to replay it xd
code blue
you know
the reason why i like you more is...you didn‚Äôt give me a death card for my bday
i didn‚Äôt know fluttershy had a horn
gummy wanna do my homework for me
she is one of a kidn
you already have no pride.
eew get it off my screen
i meant dragonair
you and me both
im hungry
how fun
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
oh i need to add you as a friend
which server are you on? if you're logged in you should see it above the minimap.
i think it was the one you said you were on
feeling a tickle on your face and then wiping that spot with your hand to see it was an ant
becuase that sounds fun
done fuck all, have you?
you know i've got 3 alts i've not played on, could play along with you or something sometime
no that's race
what level are you btw drago?
no, it's subscription based
it just doesn't let you level past 35
khajiit has wares, if you has the coin
you died gummy
except my youtube that goes to flubs
yay i disconnected
i feel bad for saying i would play even though i haven't yet
sorry sis..
gummy how dare you not play video games
i just haven't gotten the time or commitment
i also happen to be following you around
is that going to get me killed
oh cool i hav ea fire thing
lemme see if i can figure out how to put it on
wow your connection to the server is worse than mine
starting like two days ago
or the other way around
the game doesn't realize i'm disconnected
like i can still walk around and stuff
the first dungeon is unlocked at the level 15 main story quest
i see
i will catch up when i have time
kugal is being generous with his pizza
just got done stuffing my face
sure
same
btw kugal have you heard rainy's voice on stream yet?
i've been a busy boi so attending streams has been kinda hard
yeah i'm still a mod on stream but i left the server too
well if he by some miracle starts making youtube videos again maybe i‚Äôll watch
i love streams but i would them a lot if i didnt have a fuckin clue about how the games he played worked lmao
i hate to admit it because i love the guy but it's kind of true
i still like the streams though
he has with me anyway
but i enjoy watching league most of the time
my mom got me these chocolates where its these dark chocolates filled with caramel and its so yummy
i barely even understand that game sadly enough
ah rip
5 sec delay
feel like shit
nash
but you can even feel like shit when you stream!
for stream i can
grandma says i'm a bad boy
we get along really well
got my new external harddrive set up
nice
this is not newsworthy
no it wasn‚Äôt
the idea is so innocent and cute
and terrible because fiften year old drago sucked
well pokefusion is trending on twitter and it‚Äôs terrifying
problem is..i don‚Äôt remember
im going to go out on a limb and guess that it was to treat my channel like a business and not go "ehh i like making videos i guess"
im not even trying to now
nice
it's actually not, space is far too empty for there to be any reasonable chance of a direct hit from anything
yeah the universe is big and empty
i believe my mom was still a teenager when we landed on the moon
have you even seen twitter?
see? qed, fools!
ida misspelled it
due to respect for eyan
i would die, but yes i do scream
well animal man showed up today
point is something something honour something
fuck my logic
don‚Äôt encourage this...
regal you should have permissions to screw with roles and stuff if you get bored
i mean uh
i gave you the purple i guess role
gummy can't kill you if you kill him first
she just has to overkill him
helllp flubs
dont worry youll be fine
bye gummy, nice knowing you
also that would cause me to lose all my data and stuff
well if your parents are bipedal and have arms, that probably means they're of the homo genus
sis sleep
i wish
both you are sis
no you smart
hey that was me last night
lucky you
i'll wake up at 6 pm
i feel bad for going to bed cause my hound won‚Äôt share but i have headache
well i going to try to go to bed now hopefully dogs are good
if i strangle you but only partially you might pass out
what about mathematical hugs
mathematical hugs are just as great
the ratio of the average cross-sectional distance and the perimeter of your arms is pi
nooo i missed sis being drunk
they are kinda nice...
and then i had work
~~twitch streaming with gummy can be a job~~
retail sucks though
or the delivery guy doesn‚Äôt steal my medical stuff or whatever happened to my last order
im looking for an artist
if not then i‚Äôll sign tonight
well at least it's probable that people will land on mars in our lifetimes
the space
and a certain person should know what im doing
did you remove the punctuation?
lies
flubs i know what you did
(sarcasm) lets get sis porn for her bday, she certainly won‚Äôt disown me and kill me
that would be inefficient
screw you
meow
why did you put ida in a box
i want both.
so it would be basically too tempting to use on gummy.
it was doctor drago in the conservatory with the hylian shield
wow you revel
no drago
at least according to my friends list
i don‚Äôt want any more zeal connections
nothing screams fancy like deep fried potato
how much alcohol have you had and how much did you eat before that
i feel a light buzz
it means your blood alcohol content is too low
thanks flubs
this is this the shot i tried
now time to hide my celebration drinking activities from sis
borrow drago‚Äôs microwave
and i‚Äôll buy it off you
only if its scalding
thank god i don
or rarely
gummy you should stream game dev
and no drago
that is?
they told me online
it‚Äôs all online mow
that's odd.
yeah even simple places like mcdonald‚Äôs
but consider me
but yeah...walmart probably need to apply online
they told me they aren‚Äôt hiring right mow tho
and far places that i can‚Äôt get to easily
also if i start thinking about twitch streaming as a job it will get to my head
you mean you'll get addicted?
yeah..
streaming
asking for some....reasons
asking which one you should play?
also ida
neat
it's about accurate too
ah yes
big balls for someone who pissed on the couch earlier today
the screenshot?
but im gonna do...
sure drago
bios?
stormy will just tell me what to say
we just finished
turns out
she sort of likes me the most
that's good to hear.
the thing you are gonna give me
woah
i dont know if it actually saved me any time but it was fun to make right?
because it sounds funny
that sounds like a place where people go when their shoelaces are untied
who runs this server btw?
and i guess skarm
yeah star
i'll proceed to transfer ownership to an alt who's attached to a ten minute mail with a jibberish password that i won't be able to recover
sounds like some nice entertainment.
floral's ex
but not about his ex.
but floral broke up with tb and went with his ex
play ffxiv?
when i have time
turns out
i paid $200 for that
we have a problem
we need someone to stir up trouble
necro or candyman anyone?
yeah thats a fun way to say hello
i think if he does do youtube it shouldnt be anything too ambitious or he might fall into that hole again of coming back at full power and then have no energy after a week
for me it would be opposite
oh i thought you did
but fuck let's plays
i should do a let's learn
your health is important
it's a dnd joke but i think you might like it for the angry bun
idk what to think about it...
i meant in gummyland
you have weird dreams
i like high white socks.
oops, just killed half the universe.
but we discussed about getting back together in the future
which means i may be able to work on youtube and get that done instead
go to walmart
im excited though demon lord surprisingly
they were white drago
probably redo nsmb 3
videos will remain the same
just with new overlay
hey gummy do you ahve a big fat spreadsheet of your youtube stuff?
might just re-record everything tbh
maybe strawberry
what about noponz
nice nice
ah rip lol
he wants porn
hai friends ^w^
game reviews aren‚Äôt me
i went through another youtube crisis
that's what eyan has wanted to do for a long time
what i wanted to do for a long time
yeah idk man maybe my soul is shutting down
too much work to refilm
flubs i just want you to knowi
or shpuld that be the other way around
don't die
thonk
a soft restart
just different overlay
so i get double the deaths!
ive had 2 wrong numbers call/text me today
hound dogs are the best
doggo
ha i did tell everyone my pony influences help
influences what?
they influence our friendship i guess
alright you passed your drug test but you tread lightly
(yes really)
lmao
skarm stop mocking will
trying to get my caregiver to text me wats in the food she left me cause it looks like beef and i don‚Äôt eat beef
yeah thats gangstery lol
for rarity it should be "darling i know u love me"
apparently not
i would say alcohol but that never helps
rubbing alcohol?
i was thinking methanol but sure
yeah it‚Äôs a pain but there worth it ofc i have the new 2ds xl so i dunno about regular
and i don‚Äôt think i butchered it that bad
now those strangers will know im smarter than them
‚Äúdo you do outdoor activities‚Äù
well you still are
well interview..i can't fuck that up
you can though
in fact ts real easy
not final fantasy
oh cool it's updating that's fun
not for cheap people like me i assume
come on update faster ·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
oh a dragon just got stuck in it somehow
no. my dog. go away
ida am i allowed to play as a dragon in this game
which i hear is terrible to work at
like sonic
july 12 is important guys
drago it‚Äôs also almost 3 years of knowing each other
i know
17-20
who‚Äôs following who?
not me.
no one told me the 2ds xl needed that
whats up gang
kugal play ffxiv
or a lion man
er, exactly how does this "cast interrupted" thing work
sometimes damage interrupts if it's severe enough
i got a job interview
remind me, do i _need_ to do the main quest before i can play with friends or can i do random side stuff until i get to level whatever?
or a silence even
sword has a dark souls boss in it lmao
hey some advice from adults needed
yay.
also don't let them make you feel guilty either
i happen to know a thing or two about that from my own father
no it‚Äôs not broken
that happened with my first 3ds
one of the shoulder buttons would stick
i'm good at taking care of my stuff i swear
drago stop breaking things
i got $65 gamestop credit
can i have it>
oh okay
flubs can i have it
i think will might still be stuck down there actually
im sad
oh so you smack it on there and it charges it without annoying wires in the way?
3ds and charger
the dock needs to be plugged in too
fucking on thing i hate about 2ds xl and where you insert your game
well we already knew i was weird but now we know gummys 3ds peripherals are weird too
sure
then we can
drago you won‚Äôt like beans and shrimp
yeah how could he like two good foods put together
bad food doesnt taste good
drago hitting us with the absolute hot takes
i have one about perl that i havent read more than about three pages of becuase it turns out that perl sucks
let's see my self is currently:
30% programming
30% one piece
10% whatever other junk i wanted to get off the floor
do you normally get stranded in places?
so lets say 11:30
maybe 20
alright
be weary
oh no then i can't have him, mom wants clean carpets
weary is probably the worst named emote of them all
ah yes the single most confusing show to explain to someone who walks in
oh boy
"no mom it isnt porn, theyre *cooking!*"
so start rewatching the first 73 episodes of bleach got it

i fell asleep
my dad is disappointed in me becuase me and one of my female friends havent indulged in anything nsfw together
welp
yea me too
hang on
you trickster
but you don't want to sword fight your non-romantic lady friends becasue thatd be too dangerous
he wont be disappointed in me any longer
did i say that
duolingo has mommy issues
do nsfw stuff
theyre making a fourth season this fall
need safety
can never be too careful, man
i know
i've heard some interesting stories about grindr on r/gaybros
the gay reddit subs have such original names
dad: you gotta show me how around grindr
dad: it's like facebook, right? for gay people?
no not in the good way
an antirockstar
simon: dad what do you think grindr is?
yup lmao
lpt: lots of people in the exact same situation at christian events
i wanna play with you
any peeps alive
ida do i want to know
and someone had left a light pole in the middle of the walkway
ask drago about that
i not i just really confused
right now i am arguing over forms of government
booo
well i couldnt watch it the minute it came out!
well
this was the first world war
see?
yes star
they never called it world war 1 or anything
gummy!
fight me flubs
doesnt seem fair but sure
he wont have the courage to fight back
but he acts tough
and he looks tough
she will
yeah right now i have to protect her until she can protect me again
<:hanssip:562472347823505410>
also i never responded to league but okay
gummy you're already gold in my eyes
it got real quiet real fast
yeah
omg you adulting!!
kinda
im constantly in a weird mood
it‚Äôs a gay thing probably
journey was a band we didn‚Äôt deserve
just a small town girl
she took the midnight train goin anywhere
their shadows searching in the night
being gay is the only thing you should be doing
im gonna go have dinner peeps
alright gang
dammit
tomorrow isnt pride month anymore
lmao dont do that
misclick
also no kugal
it's dangeous to hold such power for extended periods of time
what hes saying is that now you have to be *really* homophobic for the next 30 days
flubs that made me laugh way too hard
but that's what his dad spent all month doing
tell me hopw fabulous they look
lmfao
im always doing something gay
kugal i dont think your dad thinks youre gay enough
the gayest
oh yea he doesnt
no do the first one. you need to ease him into it.
ah right right
dang hamster
nighty night
discord thanks for delivering my messags on time
there's more compliments where that came from
i have to kiss a guy
ew boobs
how are you?
hanging with stormy
surprisingly she ain‚Äôt mad for what happened last night
hmm my throwback
in my case
lmao
drago you never beat me up in the past
how can you throw a car, if you're so small a mini car is taller than you.
my knee hurts and i blame gummy
i know
oh thank god
right now im having trouble with it though
i should
yo deber√≠a
without watching eyan
i apparently have the number of maria now
she's almost as gay as kugal!
sis‚Äôs name is mordred
wouldn't she prefer less dread, though?
no thats your name
thats a cool ass name ngl
or make something up for fun
kugal you're a builder and worker in stone.
*a wat*
gummy you were named after my middle name
gummy your name is officially "mr bumbledink"
i actually probably know most people‚Äôs actual names here
let me count
he knows my full name.
you have rainy‚Äôs name regal
it‚Äôs just spelt differently
like the christmas kind
there was an incident on ss forums where someone accidentally guessed my last name by shipping me with another user named "lord penguin"
or fen but no one in real world calls me that
well outside of d and d but haven‚Äôt played in forever
i guess sis‚Äôs name
bad dragon bad dragon
oh hey we talked about this yesterday
hey i put work into that one okay
i hate puns but im willing to make them if it means someone will get upset
we just being bros
they were never this weird in zeal
yay peanut butter
only if you birng the ice cream
regal's bringing ice cream
in a while crocodile
ok gang kugals gotta go
no i was hungry
oh im angry
my own charlie howling cause mommy gone
snape: mista pottah
harry: no fuk u snap
hah nerd
i've read 1 - 4 and 7
damn dude way to flex on us
but thats it i swear
darn.
a lot of gay shit
blitz is err 72
nice shirt
god shit on the kaiser!
so i got up and said "at least i fell fabulously" and z snapped
my friend was fucking dead
he wasnt gay
skarm start singing
skarm sing
my turn to sing
and you say you never sing.
its fun
uuuuuuuh
(‚ïØ¬∞–¥¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ /(.‚ñ° . \\)
i vaguely remember the matrix math i did on my own accord a year ago
i do already have code to turn world space to screen space and vice versa but it's for a perspective projection and not an orthographic one
so demon lord, even when bleep this might happen
i solemnly swear that i am up to no good
i would never listen to youtube
but after a while who cares
yea i dont really swear in front of people i dont know well
darn drago
you nuke pluto
ooooooh ok
my god
gambling is dumb
i rather go to an interesting place
that you dont know what youre doing>?
my dad goes gambling every now and again and every time i swear he wins like 2 grand
pc, xbox, playstation, and nintendo switch
a fortnite one currently
they have league, im thinking of scouting it out to see how good their pc is
guys help me charlie is going mad
can i have him
ida why are you awake
i'm going to sleep now cya
ah nver mind
animalmamansmans
kewgal
i need someone
no one stayed for the credits but me
hugs gummy
if anything this is my favorite server to talk in
with the smaller
the bot says otherwise.
oh. i am glad we met, then. it's nice when people know what you mean.
lmao
therefore gummyland now belongs to her
i don't want it
im his biggest fan
let me know if he‚Äôs like a good neighbor
since 2014
nintendo stocks pls
i better sell before then
how you know amazon was my second choice?
oh yea true üò¶
has he?
you usually do something super gay to cheer me up
lmaooo
today kugal didnt have time to do gay stuff
he had to adult and get his bank account situated
i envy that tho, i never see sexy men in my dreams
ida why you do this to me
all the guys in that last picture are the same guy
omg i was almost stuck on emoji keyboard
crap im being nice to people in front of drago
aww how sweet of you
it's ok he just needs more time in the kissing booth
yeah, sounds good
this is confusing
wait you are above age right
dang you younger than gummy whoops sry i thought you were older
that's fine i get it more than you think lol
yeah people think i older or something or they used to
i turn 18 this december
yeah totally didn‚Äôt mean to hit on you kugal
kugal and master are both just perpetually high schoolers i think
are you thinking of panda? he's also gay and fabulous and way older than i lol
i don‚Äôt remember i just know whoever was getting stuck in their basement all the time
hmmmm
kugal in a blitz
ida your special gift will be delayed...
i thought you just has changed and weren‚Äôt getting stuck in the basement anymore
if anything
i should at least get up and changed but i don‚Äôt want to
no rule that says i have to stay up right
kugal you're adopted
for example he cant stop shouting how gay he is
regal kugal and i just spent all of last night in the kissing booth i think youre going to have to try a little harder if you want to achieve tmi
regal was decidedly not in the kissing booth with us
i mean, im not even gay, i just like making things weird, and saving it for later would be the antithesis of making things weird
kugal do you know any cute single dragon girls?
i know that feeling all too well having been raised by a single mother
bb in a few minutes you guys are cheering me up
ask him if he prefers carbon, potassium or uranium
i mean, not nice but
there was one time when my dad got upset with me over not wanting to get the lion king on snes
what the
yes, really
there was another time when i actually threw sand in my dad's eyes on the playground xd
i must have been mad at him that day lol
lmao
demonlord: *bends down to pick up sand and mutters to himself* "heh, nerd"
i  back with fresh underwear
the only person you have to fear pissing off is gummy and he'd never dare defying his sis
getting out of bed is hard
im not depressed i dont think but i have a tendency to sleep in till 3 pm
the latest i've slept in was 5 pm lmao
demonlord you madlad
ooooh
i tried promoting my deviantart no biters
in fact i think i killed the server
they will be back
great one of the only surveys i qualify for money on breaks goodie
how do you search up users lol
im back again
lets see dis bootiful art of yours
sunset too
im getting my bank account set up
i thought it was like a sub thing
you throwing me money drago?
(‚ïØ¬∞–¥¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ /(.‚ñ° . \\)
lmao
im gonna be out of bed for at least another couple of hours
u live west coast too kugal
oh nice
he must really hates it
even sis is better at making fun of me
lion king
lion king ida
me want to pet
i want it
and everyone runs
needs more plaid
whats up gang
nice
sorry regal :(
you got it
being too sexy?
maybe you could try the crime of sharing cute puppy pictures everywhere without permission
sounds dreadful
i second that
king corphish
king nappy fell
keep it classy, pok√©tubers
regel guess how many gay youtubers im subbed to
youre only subbed to 30 people?
ok 60
not 30
demon
37.1
that's too rational of a number
i just realized
guys
you forgot we are missing someone
<:wat:579563576914870333>
i miss him
until flubs is back
viking sis
gummy that sounds like a real good way to get her mad at you
or both of us
i'm too busy being sad all the time to be mad
final fantasy is making you sad
after windows update
drago you need an update as well
god damn it
did someone say bollocks üëÄ
we used to have a lot of kitties
but we dont anymore
guess my parents we're just allergic?
cute.
while it wasn't my favorite show, i'll admit i liked it too at one point lol
it starts one minute in
in what numerical base?
let's go with 10 for now
sweet
tyler oakley
sounds about right
two girls one dude
wouldnt the dude get lonely
one girl two cups anyone
hes an innocent boi
i see
but anyway even if you dont get the original joke, the second joke is that i'm apparently using a girl's name on a business account
so gummy should pipe down
in wonder how many words i've said in my life, and what percentile that puts me in for all of humanity
god damn it
my problem is how it makes you think the chat is fully updated and then it updates at last second and then theres 50 new chats in front of you
anyone around? i need someone
it doesn‚Äôt matter guys
that's a star in some constellation somewhere that's probably going to explode when it dies
hmmm
i hate everyone equally
besides you and will, not really
yeah she's actually an art major in college iirc
she never online
alrighty, have fuuuun
also i'm always around it's just that my silly phone would say i'm offline when i go on something else that isn't discord lol
nice nice lol ^w^
haha yeah i dont want to slee
but i should if i want tomorrow to not suck
but it's going to anyway because i'll be in the car for five hours
am i the only one who doesnt really care about the fireworks
some dumbass shot one off at 12:07 this morning
i've heard several go off every now and then lol
will is it even tomorrow where you live yet
whatever
sleep
same here
west coast gang
she's even more cultured than i am
wait, that applies to everyon
aaaa
that's the plan anyway
lol nice ^w^
hehe looks like mod training for kendall did well
wow lol
kk, nighty night
oh no
uk that‚Äôs not exactly that far off from some of my dreams
that is not a very reassuring combo tbh
are you okay sis?
take it easy then
sorry sis that your other gift never happened
for that matter, i should, too
some 60s thing
we know it's you.
i know right
kugal youre not allowed to not play video games
dang ok
so the switch lite is coming out in september apparently
it‚Äôs cheaper and less fun
just in time for 2 years of knowing each other
pretty much yeah
i missed you too my dude
either that or i thought you would hate my guts
ida surprisingly gets along with everyone there well
hes gonna be a bounty hunter
flubs will help me
that is not a plan for success
free slurpee
tell us
i never knew you liked drugs
you calling drugs, meds makes sense
can i have some?
why do you even want the meds though
and it's in a nice case
i don't do drugs but i do take cannabis to help me stay relaxed
gummyland doesn‚Äôt need me much anymore these days to be active
who wants to keep this place active?
i am sorta
flubs i just check my server
damn
i like your server but if i dont take it in small doses it hurts
server too huge gummyland i mean
vaping is gross
do they still all hate each other?
like flubs said, this economy is ruthless
some vape flavors might smell worse than cigarette smoke. which is saying something
what kind?
it's a danganronpa reference
$1 for a cup of noodles? thats a good fairy
it's open, boiled, and in your hair
im here friendos
what even the crap kugal
i can put it in the gutter in _half_ that time
that's like
youre pretty dang good
is seeing how fast you can hurl a ten-pound mass
i can hurl the ten pound mass about 17 mph on a good day
thats how i won against like 4 other people one time lmao
which is 14.3 mph
interestingly, i did the math and if i can hurl a 5 oz mass at 60 miles per hour that only comes up with half the kinetic energies as the bowling ball
shrimp!
i personally like shrimp when i don't think about them too much
like the part where they're basically massive bugs?
oh right, plastic in the seafood
we're just trained to be disgusted by bugs
but cattle isn't sustainable for the rest of the world to all eat at our rate
bison
bison is supposed to be healthier than cattle for proteim
e^x * dx/dy
no thanks i tried bothering my calc teacher with int(sqrt(xx+4)) and he just said "no you cant do that, go use a calculator"
dy/dx (e^x) ?
more of an irrational constant, its quite real
if it was a hot tub you could say it was a boiling pot of water with other people and people would start asking interesting questions
yea!
thonk
it opened yay lol ^w^
and since some of them know my mom it was awkward for me
she is probably the best person to cut my hair
well i like smashing keyboards
she will take me to anger management...again
fluba
nobody should display interests in public
hell no
so glad to have her back
demon lord
sis and i need to hang out more
i hear hes cool
kugal, i'll hang with you
nothing wrong with some cannibalism to start your day
you guys make my heart melt
only im allowed to get angry at kugal
flubs
happy 2 years of knowing each other
gummy make the pain go away
i can't
say what?>
gummy that's your morning routine
that's one dang expensive box
i got a haircut
my brother likes pineapple actually
make it the whole controller
half the controller
that bodys a real shame though
well you did
damn right its flubs
it's fibus
i had pizza
drago get pineapple
and you didnt even give me any. some friend you are
no thanks
benny shouldnt have pizza its got cheese on it
is it history?
ask drago
part of me is arguing with myself
skarm same
i just broke another one of my dishes
yea, get some fresh air might help clear your head
sorry if i worried you guys, but i thought it was important for me to be upfront with you guys
but i realized i'm not gonna feel better if i don't reach out
dont worry about it dude we're here if you need us
are you sure you dont need a hug
and the offer on the hug still stands
i still have no excuse for breaking dishes though
i didnt have like a 4 hour dinner lmao
the feel loving one, for example
and there was a song/special release mentioning about perfection
ya boy got a switch
it's for benny
oh jeez your anti-leaching off of her
gummy there was a scene in stranger things when lucas was like "max and i already broke up five times" and i thought of you immediately
he hates me
oh gummy i know the strat there
either way she did say one thing
i never gave up
> you think
which one is sarah?
oh shush its her fault
sure why not its a funny story
idk i think 3 things was too many
flubs, buddy, you have _really_ bad luck when it comes to girlfriends
luckily
i guess everyone has their demons
i mean she might not be
oh hai flubs
no i did not kill her, this is not true this is bullshit. i did ***not***
i also didnt poison her
i have a shirt that looks like that
no youre his master
he really doesnt like complex numbers i guess
i want a version of that where i says "be rational" and œÄ says "kill yourself"
says you
i need to get in contact with your aunt immediately
kucf
he likes shirts
thats literally my entire outlook on life thanks for distilling my being into a single sentence. not gonna haunt me at night. nope
<:coolgal:596255472324182017> <:charlie:579566514248744963>
true
the fuck
i don't think i'm qualified
maybe sis should train my staff...
so how are you sis
you're not alone
tbh i think we'd all be a bit happier if it weren't for social media
like i used to always grind school but i havent really done so since its summer and my brain has just been like "you degenerate of a human get to work"
social media really dements what we know as real social relationships. i know i'd be a lot happier hanging out with irl friends than browsing reddit for hours a day... if i had any.
thats good sis
i'm trying to find groups of computer people physically located \*somewhere in new jersey\* who i could go meet as part of the "making friends" part of finding a job
"i halp"
gummy
how about you be friends with me?
but i thought you liked my math stuff?
this is certainly an eye opening experience
or maybe it was stab them
no to destroy someone mentally advice
yeah, just not always great for _gummy_
then she msgs me saying we will never stream again
so i asked her whats wrong and she said her other ex bf threw a tantrum because she wanted to live stream with me over watching stuff with him
why is everyone on the internet a goddamn child
flubs dont ask questions you already know the answer to
i literally was like
ok but if they arent dating why does he care what she does and why does she care what he thinks
so this is the situation
yeah but still. it seems like all the gears in this broken watch and stopped
what kind of asinine reason is that
idk but he only attacks when she and me are streaming
he gets custody bc hes known her longer? fuckin idiot
gummy how can you be so consistently smart and dumb like this at the same time
then we arent friends any more >:(
sure he sucks
no need to waste time
nuuuuuu üò¶
hey no nuking servers is my thing
and tend to complain to flubs about my issues
im literally meeting this guy at bronycon in two weeks
i wanna collect muskets
ahahahah
gummy if you actually suspect there's going to be a physical confrontation contact the security desk and tell them
i can‚Äôt wait to meet drago at magfest
a real confrontation will happen
i should show up to magfest but not say so, and then nobody would figure it out
i'll go!
but he can do that from here
top ten best pranks
yeah but then id have to find you
yeah i'm like the only normal person there
drago looks like discount drago
drago. he does it
jesus christ 5 years
yeah but since hes finished a series
ah yeah
last one was black & white 2
was it really that common
stop being old
well a 15 year old shouldnt be dating a 12 year old
flubs are you 7?
im 7 too
i'm a newborn plus or minus 23.8
fuck caillou
im getting a milkshake
vanilla with chocolate syrup
go boil your head
or both
who me?
gummy wanna get married?
no one is at this age
me marrying ida sounds like a good way for me to get murdered by ida
same with flubs
thing is
i will murder them!
im quite timid irl
online im grumpy
if i was the wizard, would gummy be the thief and ida would be the viking?
i was thinking if i had to pick a convention to go to, it would probably be magfest
(i thought thief was my job tho)
flubs i wanna meet you as well
my dog is not the alcoholic in our relationship
on a side note, i would also rather wait till trump is out of office before i travel to the d.c. area
sorry for getting political there but yeah
no thats just a good idea
cool kids need to take constantly backed up bridges
looking at dc from an airplane, 15 minutes away from congress and the whitehouse are neglected neighborhoods that nobody wants to invest money into fixing. really says a lot about congress' activities
both go east to west and theyre exactly the same
google maps doesnt even give the parkway its numerical designation lmao
trains do not work
dont know
the projected date to finish it is 2022, which means the next projected date is 2030 and the completion date is never because the lirr is hell
there's a relatively small county road which relatively minor construction began in 2015, was supposed to take a few months and finally finished in late 2017
im not sure we're both about to find out
speed limits should be ignored if traffic conditions make them unsafe üíØ
excuse you i _like_ doing 60 in the 65 zone
my dad is the expert of always sticking with the speed limit, even if it means not going with the flow of traffic. we'll be on the freeway doing 60 when everyone is doing 70 and he'll be like "look at all these idiots!"
drivers here are slightly less horribl
theyre all special
left lane = the place not to be a dumbass is what i picked up on too
im glad i was looking down at my phone or i prolly would've shat my pants
last week this semi truck came like 2 inches away from smushing my dad and i on the freeway
that seems like a weird case where you would use `me and my dad`
im the mathboi
the rule is "if you would say `me` without `other person` it's `[other person] and me`, otherwise it's `i`
we'd rotate, at first we did reading, then for the next unit or two we did vocabulary, and then the dreaded grammar
what in the cinnamon toast fuck
that though is fine yo
yough and yo
are basically the same
it makes sense
oh ok
you see?
believe what you can understand for that is the purpose of languagge
we should abolish language
what is your guys' dream language you'd wanna learn
i was looking at kotlin today and it looks pretty neat but i don't know if i'd ever really use it for much
people tell me rust is fun to work with, and lately ive been talking to a guy who lives and breathes in haxe
i mean i've got both those endings in nier automata, t was funnier though
since i have no idea what we're talking about, w
flubs why are you upside down
can you hear can you hear that thunder?
which is why i sleep on my stomach, but according to every chiropractor, that is the act of a madman and you should never sleep on your belly
really?
flubs you were weird before this
anyone home?
fair
just hide it behind the big rock, nobody'll see it there probably
musket parts?
no we all know it's his rarity body pillow xd
yea i would say that's accurate
maybe you need an older sis
or only with me because of money
i only have one sister and she's absolutely horrible.
then buy her new stuff again.
i really doubt it, to be honest. she has my step-father's personality, and my step-father is the worst person i have ever met, and she shares a lot of character trails with him, which is an awful sign.
flubs why is all my compliments offensive and my insults are non offensive?
good
dammit and i just bought a switch lmao
this is why i wait
drago why is it everytime you buy something, and then they announce better stuff?
because i'm cursed
brot
but it's noon
ida i need advice
i'm died
like my viking sis
i dont even dislike jeans
same
of the skinny variety
jeans look nice though
bad gum
skinny jeans are fabulous
so kiddies
this is like 4 keyboards in total in less than one year
swimming in money sure is fun though
but think of the paper cuts
the alternatives are you all give flubs all your possessions and i skip town
all i want right now is stormy
i'm back for the next 2 minutes and i'll see ya guys in a month
gummy come to new york its objectively better than all the other us cities
no flubs
i don't know if i've ever been to baltimore
‚Äúgummy do you think about anything other than food?‚Äù
frick
even though she let us go early
any glasses you wear are your cute glasses kugals
yay gummys a bully
that same guy also showed me his private part twice
do i have to sign in order for you to set it on fire?
oh bully, kugal is here
this place is bully
same
i knew he had it in him
how do you bully
flubs bully animal man
you told me you wanted to
damn camelot is making us all not violent
nobody is gonna fight back against the dude in a wheelchair, so i dont bully
sis was violent
but back when i was just the kinda scrawny kid who liked to run i would bully
was i violent?
you stayed the same
you can do it demon lord, demons are pretty violent.
imma post lewd shit
be specific
ditto
actually i'm asexual so it doesn't really matter to me
who me?
this is what kugal is
is that gummy's?
i believe that is charlie the dog's wrist
this is me<:charlie:579566514248744963>
that‚Äôs benny‚Äôs wrist
mine are 7" around
you measure your wrists
wait
nighty night
good night my son
they didn't move into the house we were cleaning out until the late 90s
so the medicine had been expired for a decade, and instead of disposing it, they took it with them
medicine can expire?
most of the time it won't do what it's intended to do, and depending on the compound it could introduce new unfortunate things
game designers' home planet is twitter apparently so i'm okay with it existing since it's probably a net positive in my life currently
which was dumb in its own right
thanks drago
oh drago
have fun with that i guess
hey cool you have the same kind of cabinets my old house had
no grenades or rocket launchers? amateurs
woo!
thanks kugal
you know what
lmao
if you saw this, it would make you so angry
yes it‚Äôs peta...but for once i agree
wait what
also wait are the roots 0 -3 and -4? im very rusty with this stuff
you can also yank out a 3
4 and 3
guys i got a new dream job
well reviews are mixed so i was just wondering
i got my switch set up too
a bit. its white
i see
thank you flubs
fair enough
im thinking about making a survey for gumland
gummyland is like a reactor powered by explosions that uses its created power to regenerate itself
today i sent this message
and no flubs gumland is stable
exactly. its stable but extremely fucking chaotic
skarm shut up
ash is also dead
all in favour of inviting squid and rc?
and drago don‚Äôt you put me down?
no flubs
you two helped me glue everything
awesome!
im very happy to have you around
sigh
mood
and realized half of you wouldn‚Äôt survive in gumland
did i have this poc
kugal i think i'm flagging you as "best friends"
thats my name shut up
my name is supergummying
mason dope
im pretty sure most, if not all of you losers know my last name
but i cannot say it or i get beat up
i could probably find out what it is but she clearly doesn't want it out there so i won't try :p
didnt gummy also guess my name? i forget
at some point i just decided that flubs name was "steve" and i dont know if i actually had a reason for that
do you remember if i had a reason, steve?
paul
i haven't met too many people irl with my name oddly enough
well i meant dan lol
there was only like one class in high school i was in where there was another dan
it was a food class
gummy probably remembers who i'm referring to lol
yes i know
dunno if theyre all like this but the subways ive been to just . . . don't have good lettuce. or vegetables. or bread. or meat. the sauce is okay sometimes but i usually want more than sauce for a meal.
i had no idea there were any in the us
although i suppose
i guess five guys is technically fast food, and i actually like five guys a lot, so there's that
i know there was at least one tim hortons in rochester but i didn't have a car then and i wasn't about to get on my bike to go to fast food
i'm almost positive there's one in new jersey _somewhere_ but it sure isn't near me
i knew it
then you cough up the meat and swallow it
flubs you are good at this
you should give lessons
flubs give me your waller
mine has the imperial legion symbol thingie on it, you can';t have it
mines just a brown leather thing from the 30s or something
oh you know what
anyone wanna join?
thats why the trick is to not mess up
flubs i nominate you to be the next man on the moon
pretty expensive
yeah bc its far
alternatively just wait a couple billion years till the sun goes red
vector equations and plane equations are loads of fun
hi sisters
my ffxiv character posing like a fate/stay night character
i deactivated my twitter a few days ago
i see
mom: grandma, these are your pants that you left here
grandma: why do you have my pants?
mom: you brought them over because you wanted to wash them but didnt have a full load of laundry
dad: no they're from the time you went home without your pants
i wanna watch mind games and social engineering not weird unacknowledged racism
me too
gummy i think she meant she was sure she didn't wanna watch it lol
hey gummy i hear youre in the market for another sibling
drago you can't date your siblings
according to both us and canadian law
just nobody knows to arrest you for it
the third party is you
imagine what people would be "encouraged" to do if you had the option to not take breaks
part time master
time to retrieve it tomorrow
i've got a question
steak
oooh
eh i hit enter too early
pizza with a topping of steak. the fun part comes in that bits of steak are dropped onto the pizza as its being cooked so you never know if the next hit if meat will be brown, blue, pink, or almond
alright brbr imma go get steak
nice to meet you
im back with my steak
i'll share with drago since he's my date
flubs, buck you. i don't want to sleep, i want to stay awake.
flubs fuck you
parents came remember
you know it
mondays don't exist
tuesday happens twice
<:wat:579563576914870333>
tuesday 0:03 am
im not dating gummy im dating kugal
look it's not my fault you never learned the days of the week
<#542153256898658319>
it's the fur okay
hehe
how do you know if a bar is gay or not? did you see it making out with another bar?
no i joined in
you'll be all right kugal
i don't know why you're going but i've been through similar experiences since i was a kid
not gonna lie i totally cried during that phone call lol
im back from ss office
<:wat:579563576914870333>
thank god
schutzstaffel office
<:wat:579563576914870333>
he was blowing it up
gummy if it makes you feel any better i'm sure there are already a ton of suspected murderers already in your province
i dont know if that would actually make you feel better or not
aw thanks
i found it out completely by accident and was shocked
my keyboard is so cheap but i love it
and this is where bad luck starts
which is also missing the shift key
sis you need a new laptop
depends on whether you plug it into the port next to the heat sink or not
and that had button issues
i told you people about the old keyboard i had that was okay except for the real heavy keys right?
nope
well mine aren't heavy keys
same
>there's already that thing added?
yes üòÉ
no problemo friendo
that or we just made the volcanoes angry
i think people as hot as flubs contribute the most
volcanoes are human enthusiasts confirmed
how do you know master?
shit
after gummy dies, i take dips on his pc!
sis gets that as well
i have two flubs
thanks.
green is the nerdiest of the colors
i will try out that windirstat program.
that thing
reminds me of windows defender lmao
its good if youre not an idiot online
thanks flubs
good thing im not an idiot online
flubs
you own a company
but i wont
pattent pending
no risk, no obligation, no red tape, no down payment
speaking of money
so come on in for a free demonstration and a free consultation
i got my debit card today pog
should also probably get a stock market account set up and invest once the next correction hits
sounds lit
you're lit, gummy!
y'all are lit
i've only got an interest checking and a money market account
get drago to put it out
oh crap it's animalmanaanaoan
oh shoot gotta go
why the ***fuck*** am i green
animalunderscoremanunderscore
so far so good, kugal in a blitzz, how are you doing, kugal in a blitzz?
nein
i bet it is cool, for a math wiz
that's all you should be doing
you better not
right now i am working on bringing the server to a staple 200
i mean, i might leave the computer, but discord will still be on
red is dans color
animal\_man\_
f30252
i prefer dixie land though
you'll get there
and that is lincoln's fave song
interesting
everything else is light
even on windows
skarm
though i can do that if you want
damn it
gosh i'm not special anymore because you chump nuggits took my color
and musket games
and cooking mama
specifically the first one, but 2 isn't bad
omg that looks exactly like my cat
it's a real possibility
thought...
e!role thing
e!role thing
try that
e!role thing
e!role thing
indeed
back from dinner follks
i ‚ù§ you too bot
awesome
i second that
but almost getting hit by a car is like almost dying
nothing crazy there, everything in the order of operations makes sense
now ive heard of george carlin
good
no, it was a schutzstaffel office.
this guy seems on the up-and-up
he died 11 years ago
but yeah he was very lively
‚Äúif my doctor told me i had only six minutes to live, i wouldn't brood. i'd type a little faster.‚Äù 
‚Äï isaac asimov
what i was just talking about with not dwelling on life he really addresses that starting at around 38 mins
gummy forcing me to be social
so hi bitches
im hereeeeee
oh gummy i still mad at you
wait no
thats starlight
oooo hot
best description of punic wars ever
really
kek.
yeah drago, you need an update
i did update
or something
fen can be a brosister
nothing animal man
but we're all very homo
the hell
gummy, you know what you gotta do.
he's pretty talented
it was random really lol
i'm not sure how to feel about that xd
you're as old as one of my friends.
you same age as me cool
im pissy right now star
tmnt?
skarm and demonlord are twinsies
you know i realize it's probably on github
lol beak
to be fair i wouldn‚Äôt mind some hand holding action
i face palmed so hard
that is an infinitely better mnemonic than the one i learned
he‚Äôs won‚Äôt eat him
it's 9:30
it was dark an hour and a half ago
so that might actually help
the dude was kicking till like 80 he covered a lot of shit
i'm like 95% sure the mets are going to lose
i mean i get the part where a solid half of all games are derivatives of ping pong
youre 100% sure the mets are gonna lose drago
xcom odds
bc i was raised a yankees fan
oh no
how awful
oh hell yeah
im only in gamemaker and letsplay and a couple others that only get like one post a day like pokemonrmxp and stuff
everything drago does is fun and good (:
okay fine i'll make them take a bath
im like a very pale white on a good day
on a bad day im pretty sure i just reflect all light
shes plotting to take over gummyland once and for all
oh jeez sorry about the spoilers then
sure discord just dont load the gif dammit
it‚Äôs that time of the week again where i question how well i am as a server owner
cause no one here can run gumland
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115>
i just worked opening to closing
ahhhhh
how many hours is that? :|
master i finished up the kepler thingy no one took up the offer before i finished the lesson feelsbadman lol
the bad news: mom's phone decided to bug out so they can't scan our tickets to let us in
the good news: today is mr met on the moon day at citi field and they still have some left when we arrived
welcome to the future
i figured out how to make my ffxiv character read
/r/brandnewsentence
it's the max level
i see
but now it has confirm to also be ending
go skydiving, try some meth, see a play
we got pizza yus
lol me too
yesssss
we can be pizza sisters
it's 2019 after all
be both
drago went to an alternate universe
switch forever?
and you wouldnt have to go to college or work any more
because eyan thought it was confusing
get better flubs
september 20th could be a fascinating day...
the green or yelow?
there is now rgb
hmmm
thonk
not me
never played
cause you are constantly tired so i gotta keep you away
gummy i had an opportunity to give you a war cry
apparently i'd manage to get int
or perish
is that an `and` or `or`
gotcha
you fool
no i meant thanks
eimm people
not even the || redacted ||
and then she killed me again
since i don't do the whole betray people very well
since they do it too much
wow, nice.
yeah i am too tbh
when she died that one game
what me?
i was basically screwed
we need to find a new game
speaking of which i havent played that in a while
they lied to me
fine i will download it now
oh my god yes
the third joke is that i'm too uncreative to come up with more than one fictional name in my life
im usually online if you feel like trying to get into it
give me link
thanks sis
which still lets you try all of the classes
i was just wandering in random directoins and doing stuff that people told me to last time i played ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
cause that's kinda what quests are like
you should be fine doing that until you figure out a more directed approach
something about story progress?
no you mean youre going to download it overnight and install it tomorrow afternoon
iirc i have fire, ice and one that i don't really know what is for
commentary
i'm lacking in microphone and the ability to talk into a microphone
gummy you sure you dont want to commentate? i wanna hear _your_ voice
oh come on now _i_ want to hear your voice
good point
basically my ex told me not to be stupid in front of her sister which is like ida and me, they aren't actually blood related
rip x 2
wait what
did that msg delte?
i have no clue
holy crap i thought we removed that like a year ago
sis attack!
musket
muskets
it's `ex`, from _that_ stage
she was telling me not to act stupid in public
my sister keeps calling breath of the wild "the wild man game" because she can't remember the actual title
im gonna call it that from now on cos i like that name a lot more
<a:a_wild_gremlin:590514192507994132>
<:ponkohyouknow:525081375888506883>
wasn't starlight here already?
i just got out of bed about.... 5 minutes ago
hacker yes
and everything
<:pinkie_awkward_smile:636655055134785558>
i deny all allegations of attempting to give bringina chocolate with hot sauce and hot mustard
i'm just showing
here take this sis, that should keep you happy
chicken? extra no.
oh you don‚Äôt like chicken
well mitch we should see if we can drag tenda in
if she hasn‚Äôt slept
also some vandalized the first nations university
hey sis i gave a warning about me saying something stupid, plus im in a russia mood because im currently learning about the russian empire, and the song itself is truly beautiful. it legit sounds like a lullaby
wow im dumb
there we go
i really want a hot dog now
but point is to not act stupid
e!bot
lets switch for a day then flubs
disgusting
like gums when he was young
but vietnam
so i've just been informed of some rather
‚Äúyoung people in vietnam continue to be taught at home and at school that same-sex attraction is a ‚Äúdisease‚Äù and a ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù that can be cured and treated, despite legislation designed to support and protect lgbtq+ rights.‚Äù
fuck i forgot about the review
so he has a terrible infection in his hand, which has spread to his arm
yeah
he is expected to make it through to summer
the sooner he starts making money again the better
3. don't invade russia at all unless you can conquer siberia before october starts
also germans did well against russia in ww1
what
e!crash
all the more for the rest of us
we already have whip cream though
why _don't_ i need cake topping
because "pc shit" is probably league and league is toxic af
pretty much
with whipped cream
kugal you should probably play the kingdom rush games too
fun is an illusion by the entertainment industry to sell more
ask sis
but 90% of them are great updates
wait you read all the msgs here? what happened to being lazy?
thought i said a lot yesterday
exactly
forgot to do that lately
okay
also now that it's not constantly bugging out the new youtube studio's actually okay
admittedly it took them like two years to iron it out, but still
like take a look
you rang
theyre fun
he only has like 45k subs
if your pok√©mon series is binomial or higher i'm not interested
what the hell is a binomial?
anyways
gums with bringy and with tenda lurking around
thanks flubs
216 questions lets go
it's like a binary partition but more bureaucratic
...morning????
who?
basically cool germany
then i learned where poland was and thought "oh that explains why it gets invaded by russia so often"
why is pic so bad?
what im trying to say is it can either save you a step or cast variables when you dont want them casted and its a double edged sword like no fucking other
eh fuck it
and i didn't realize there was a middle ground
the kingdom prussia started off in a small territory of poland
the two will connect together after destroying poland
oh i love that music
actually no
that's like saying sparta survived till today, implying they were still a self sufficient city state
they were just called the german empire
most of my history comes from the bean people over at extra credits
meanwhile athens absolutely fucked the persians up at marathon, so hard, they sent them back home with a grudge
oh wow
in some cases the epic covers are just completely unmodified
so how were athenians on equality?
in grade 10 class
while all guys prefer athens
not like roman slaves or something like that
vikings are metal af
but i think those were also able to work for their freedom
which was followed by ww2 and us being cut off from denmark and basically going "screw this"#
they did, because greek skirmishes were a daily thing
that'd make tug-o-war more interesting
i bet they were called the dark ages because it was before they'd invented the light bulb
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
then fucked thwm right back when they were weak
ouch
true
$47 in total for gas
so probably
i always get a new followers
i take it someone didnt make it through
lmao
lads got powers but this one dude dont. hes the main character
gummy told me u hate anime
it's a shonen anime
nor have i had a mood swing
yeah ive watched heroaca. fell off with the latest season bc it didnt interest me but enjoyed it up to that
the animation looks pretty neat though
its pretty light on the moaning which is nice
not free of moaning, but close enough
its a good show but kinda weird
the escalation from normal to weird is slow enough that if you watch the whole show it doesnt matter but if you skip pretty much any of it youll drown
i've made some mha oc concepts
real name: something japanese 
hero name: lord fafnir
quirk: transform into a massive fire breathing dragon, but is incapable of speech while transformed
age: 41
status: deceased
accelerating mass and shit is kind of insanely op
i sense two opposing forces at play here
you rang
name a more iconic duo
so guysss
so me
okay i found a quiz i wanna do
guys
e!crash -f
e!crash -f
e!exit -f
alright
i just rolled two critical fails in a row in dnd
e!bot
i like how im maybe and drago is just a flat no
no he is nice
i have finalized the most important development in the history of let's plays
is that image 8 pixels or has my internet died
is it bad that i'm legitimately worried about the bunny dying before we finish the game? because the bunny's like 9 years old and the game is listed as 50 hours on hltb
oh god not rabbit
i can't right now
he has one and only one facial expression, and it's "intense disapproval"
so here is my latest commissionb
ooooh
oh drago
is this true?
hello sis
if you were to claim he's gay *and horny*, though, then it might work.
but people assume he made them like that because he was gay
diego might
is diego even still in here?
cant you filter by event like "join / leave," "nick change," etc though?
joins and leaves don't appear
welp
it doesn‚Äôt
it circulated a while ago
not you too
e!bot
my log bot records all joins and leave
and they are not allowed to join voice call
i feel like you would get a lot of those, somehow
we do
us being a pony server targets a lot of raiders
but this would be the first time he's uploaded since discord became a thing
funny how time flies right?
ah yeah
and the last thing i want is sis being pissed off
you are either on her soft side or not
drago very simple, edgy 16 year old
thank god im usually her soft side
oh two more as well
banned 3 already
that messed them up
mod training vids?
yes flubs
no but seriously
what did you think though?
i also dont think we have chick fil a
is for anyone who is a regular or a non troll
be super super nice to regulars or new nice people
it was more because it was on the side of the turnpike and i needed food than because i wnted to
want an ice cream sandwich?
that is wondeful
truly we live in an age of wonder
thought these are better
who would willingly admit they live in wyoming
anyone living in wyoming
wyoming falls into the list of like 25 states that could be consolidated into one and still be both the least populous and interesting
carbs and sugar in one meal
of course that's not happening now lol
make trudeau buy the entire usa
im happy to hear that
mitch im disgusted
gummy is british and not canadian
everyone here is either left or close to left
it has to be a castle or palace
with*
but i wanted to make a joke about there being no dying in the pokemon world
make a joke
make a joke!
yes there is death
they kinda brushed over lavender town in the anime
the original series brushed a lot through tbh
strangely enough though i think it was the best series out of the first dozen or so because of how they didn't have as much filler
20% was not filler in johto
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
male feminists are basically people that support women or something
guys
that series has been running for 25 weeks and youre just now realizing that?
i had no time this morning to make breakfast
we dont have food
im in the library
yeah i don't get it either, but amd's tripled in the last three years so i probably shouldn't complain
it's the newest one
see? new,
guys
im going to play so much of that gme
most people considered mystery dungeon dead so hopefully this one does well so they can continue it
like if a pokemon you recruit faints then it gets unrecruited.... that was a bad change
but i also have a real copy
which i think i bought in... estonia?
twice
7 years ago
why do you have lewd art of your oc
hopefully it captures the charm of the originals well
im narcissistic
is it incest though?
i mean i don‚Äôt think we had any stupid bits in the original game?
i assume you let it off in the woods on friday, let it bounce around randomly for two days and pick it up again on sunday
why are you advertising that you have lewds
you just rapidly oscillate the muscles that contract and expand a limb. i can do that for short periods of time with my left arm before it starts hurting.
flubs eats food?
by "these pretzels" do you mean a specific pretzel or just pretzels in general?
too bad see ya in heaven, loser
sorry i didnt realize you are kugal and havent eaten anything but nutrient slurry before
drago im trying to troll you and sis
so gotta bring the zeal server personality to you guys
cause flubs not gonna lie
you seem to mellow down
what should i do then
ok imma just distill comedy into its purest form
im innocent and pure <a:starlightwinkblep:587239549785079819>
do not answer that
nostalgic
these days it‚Äôs ‚Äúthats gummy to you‚Äù
im trying to get flubs mad at me
fuck if i know
why do you want us to be mad at you
that doesn't mean i'm omniscient
i have no clue what that word means sis
but i was joking, no one can know everything
not the gob
i dont know that
not glob
but only for knowledge
oh yeah i assume that sis
all right demon lord let's get this straight
im on my phone typing
trump is a literal stool sample
trump instills existential dread
i'm just saying to pretend he's a real democrat is laughable
i wish he'd go away, yeah
thats just worse democracy
idk flubs
napoleon didn‚Äôt do everything thing
what the heck i never knew he was a pervert
that's when things will get exciting
they don't represent the diversity of the country at all
so i'm not 100% sure if there were any winners in that debate
i ignored the last few but i watched this one because the crowd's a bit thinner now
sis sleep
kiss was in vc ya know and she was fangirling over the invader zim voices
doesn't have alcohol
gummy thanks for dropping the animal crossing direct, i'm super excited for the game üòÑ
damn it sis
bringina, if you love your island, don't do it
no clue
what the crap i thought you said you got one
best friends is a stupid concept
best friends exist?
mine abandoned me really dramatically, does that count?
im still waiting for the day bringy abandons me
idk that seems pretty dramatic
depends on the kind of cake
there is ice cream cake but im also hiding inside it. the abandonment was a ruse
otherwise all the pand shall be thrown into the ocean
museum is so pretty, the big aquarium? absolutely beautiful
ive always wondered if you could kill someone with a smoke bomb
<:ponkglock:644266129925341197>
well i can name a place or two thatd be better than others
which im currently not at
part of me wants to dig my 3ds out of the deep recesses of time just to play the mystery dungeon games that i didnt know existed
really confused about why the a button is only working in specific places though
it open again!!!
i just broke a hair comb while combing my hair üòÇ
flubs you break something
fine *breaks his own heart*
flubs
i got you a new pet
how sweet
i mean, that would help
rip my sister for about the next 6 months?
rip my social life when animal crossing comes out that is if i can get it day 1
i know he would xd
where are you?
galarian transgender pokemon yessss
ordered a new headset today so i'll be able to join you guys again soon
lol as long as it works that's all that matters to me
join us soon in the gumlands as gummy freaking out
snacks
awww
sagan wasn't even that old, that's just heartbreaking
hasn't been a good week for cats it seems
it's one thing when you know a cat is old and nearing the end but this was just way too soon
wrong channel, whoops
gummy and i pretty much pulled an all nighter we watched and did so much stuff
omg lmao
my favorite part of the night was making gummy suffer with pokemon black and white
blitz
and rn there's family drama, the type where family members declare they'll never speak to this family member ever again
and he decideds to call me to only tell me to tell my sister (who wont talk to him) to call him
so more like not very surprising but also im a bystander watching all this drama go down and i can't help but find it the least bit amusing
it's amusing for blitz
make a youtube series about it
and yea pretty much, and i dont wanna have that shit spread lmao cos it just exposes how fucked my family situation is lol
how old are you sis?
<:mordredthink:561981371279605771>
im not that surprised
well
headset advice
sorry i'm watching a fire emblem stream right now lol
guys
it's a mix between snorlax and piplup
it's easy
what
i'm already yellow
4chan related
thats the one
ill give you something yellow
please do
flubs
which are real words
so there's at least that
so they lied to me?
remember when i said a broken clock is right twice a day? that applies to uberfacts as well
take that flubs?
new plan
they should really call it ubertrivia
what you mean?
i think it looks interesting
what??
and how dare my influence isn‚Äôt working?
animal crossing!!
"several cutscenes will now be played in sequence"
so you have chosen.... death.
all in all: whoever created that menu belongs on a fucking cross
ah my food expert here
basically in simple terms: peanut butter, banana, and bacon milkshake
cause it‚Äôs good?
even sis can‚Äôt stop my milkshake addiction
no one can
because gummy is cheaper than mr krabs
no demon lord
and the cables are making me suspicious
gummy where on earth did you even find that
magic drago
<a:ponksnapped:643691595614519297>
"always manage your textures properly. you don't want to end up like that guy, do you?"
guys
i just played games when my parents let me
sounds similar to me when i was 10ish
through naruto?
then i started to make accounts when i was 11ish
also gummy i will never understand you being proud of your own childish behavior
üëè üëè good job gummy
yes, through naruto fanfiction. "huh, naruto x sasuke... oh two guys can be together? thats new, okay"
because sis, why be ashamed of it? yeah it was stupid but if you think negative about it, it‚Äôs not gonna make you happy
if you think back and laugh about it, it cheers you up
....you know, that's actually a decent mindset
that's a skill you should probably put on your resume or something
just ask bringina, im very careful around making sure what she also wants instead of it always being me
gummy is high wisdom low intelligence character u see
also i remember when i drunk deleted my youtube channel, yeah i learn how to limit my alcohol intake to 1 drink every 1-3 months
and drago
you rang
that makes no sense
psyduck is like pls help
i mean their trainer only wants it for the color of its skin of course it's uncomfortable
movie pizza
looks like meatballs
even though it wasn‚Äôt a horror movie
if that pizza had a little bit more cheese, i'd say that looks fantastic af
i mean sis i always wanted to know what your accent sounds like
at this point i feel like whatever we imagine ida's accent to sound like would automatically be funnier than whatever it actually is
eh i convince it similar to danish norwegian accent
it was at bronycon
think im going through a mini midlife crisis
my life is been the same lately
though some animal crossing and pokemon are making my life less boring
i mean no one really has everything figured out at 19
but it ain‚Äôt bad but feels like im like 50 years old
i used to have no idea what i wanted to do for short term goals but had an idea for long term goals
as long as youre happy, that's all that matters
and gummy, im sure you'll figure it out soon
that's kind of t be expected
lol well you're ahead of eyan at least
out of how many he finished?
the world simply isn't ready for his epicness
they still exist after all these years
yeah there's a few thaat haven't died from old age after the 80 years of waiting
tbh i hate studying
and this might be ego ish
just to figure out how i can improve for next stream
we can collaborate on miitpoia
you would be correct on that üòÇ
it isn‚Äôt
i already doubt my ability to sleep
dang i wish all of my rejections could come in the form of that
streaming league is hard because i get pissy
like savage raids
i been studying some of them sis
yeah
people tend to stream the new content
it sounds confusing
and that's not how it works
there's 3 tanks, 6 healers, and 15 dps
the crystal tower series is at level 50, unlocked after the credits roll
some crafting maybe
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
i'm fairly cheap too
do dream together
mario looks like a mexican - gummy
yes sis
~~wow she remembers~~
though i did promise nightshade an oc
i should actually get to work on that
get amd
fairly sure the 3600 actually draws less power than my current cpu too
but i rarely get anything for myself unless it's food or soda
oh god
barricade the doors and windows
can't sis, parents are coming as well
run away
and for real for both you and drago, prob hop around in the house then leave 5 mins after
a plushie of the pony oc made for me
or a sympathy discount
i did something amazing
did you get banned again?
my god that sounds gross
and it does imo
yea?
100% sure kiss ain't a skullkidfan thing prank cause she did a face reveal last night
so we weren't certain if this was a skullkidfan 2.0\
i drew this character
i was told to add a crown
butter oil
butter is better imo
so turn the darn thing around halfway through
thats kinda just an issue. if you dont care about presentation or one half being too cold, you could always chop it at the divide and cook the bad end some more
well i wanted a medium rare
fun thought experiment though
1080p and hd?
a broken clock usually just refers to one where the batteries died
this works well because battery can also refer to menacing or aggressive contact
sure why not
hey gummy
you mean dangaropa?
spider man 2
because i want to argue with you about it
i remember that
good job square (‡πë‚Ä¢Õà·¥ó‚Ä¢Õà)b
‚Äúkill yourself‚Äù
my dudes got a whole friggin arc
jesus is real
hey my dad told me to do that
thats also rude
so then was the way of teaching the kids just the parents undermining what the other one says?
and dinosaurs are made up
and climate change cant be real bc the earth isnt real
he tells me
and dug them up to make money
because he said if they were, then why can't we see them
but says trump will crush them
me too
> and dinosaurs are made up
let's be honest, that's his loss
i'm forever happy that i thought that in the shower one day and then later learned that other people who were actually smart had the same idea about dragons and dinosaurs
to be fair even the short ones
there have been people who made up dinos to become famous but those generally get uncovered as frauds and they're also violating dig site rules
it's the only thing that i've done with my life that's been even less profitable than youtube!
i just read his status thing
im pretty sure mine is still one of the boss songs from ebf3
my little sister just said ‚Äúi hope gummy dies to my dad‚Äù...
now i just feel inadequate
pretty messed up because bernie is jewish
i don't think i would be against msnbc sacking him
too bad i don‚Äôt have cola sis
healthy
ohh my stomach
and calling me a vegetable is incredibly rude
there are several possible responses i can think of this this conversation and they're all awful
im usually incredibly disappointed in the things i say here but that one made me a little proud
im not sick to where i cannot work
besides new horizons, what should i get, i can only choose one. new super mario bros u deluxe, super mario maker 2, pokemon sword/shield, mario kart 8, pokemon mystery dungeon dx
nor mario maker
if you have someone irl to play with, then nsmbu is a good choice
i don‚Äôt sadly
and there's an unlimited amount of it in mario maker
i guess dx in that case
i definitely want it for collection
i say dx or sword and shield
did u play mario kart on the wii u
out of all options
dx and mario maker are highest
yeah mario maker is a much better value for money than new super mario bros. u
personally i think dx is the better choice now that i think about it because everyone i know wants to pick it up
huh guess it's the alternative spelling so it was spelled right
also after watching a film
drago is main protagonist
i was the protagonist who stayed whole to nap
mario kart 8 it is
they still can't even pass the green new deal in congress let alone something like that
imma blow up the fuckin sun and replace it with a robosun
give the nation 7 more months
if bernie gets in that means that enough of the nation supported him and he can continue to rally that populist base to put a lot of pressure on congress
they'll end up giving it to bloomberg if bernie doesn't get an absolute majority of delegates
god why do we suck
bread and circus
you don't think everyone in america wants the nation to end at this point we have fallen off the grid
no i think my dad is still enjoying it
i mean if america _actually_ ends the rest of the world's not going to have a fun time either, because globalism
gummy calm down at least you don't have an orange man who gropes woman as president
i want russia to be like the russian empire again
if russia ended i'd be pretty happy
references: am chinese
by ending
japan culture is better than america
just look at japan after world war ii and japan today
they need an emperor
they'd pick japan
mitch that's like asking the people who cut gym class every day if they approve of gym class
only until they realize anime wasn't a thing in the 40s
i do believe shinzo abe is liberal
i mostly mean towards lgbt stuff and feminism
i remember in 2016 when he dressed up as mario during the summer olympics closing cermony lol
i dare donald trump to do that
i would do that
one who accepts change
and has the power to make good chnages
haha he could still get worse, just kidding
since canada police arrested many today
imagine trump dressing up as mario lol
he‚Äôs mexican
i have a feeling obama would have done that if you asked him nicely
don't think so
i believe we had one in canada for a very short time
oooo lesbian prime minister
if buttigeg somehow wins i'll be happy because it'll make the conservatives spontaneously combust, but also i'm not the biggest fan of buttigeg so urgh
thats like the universal consensus drago
of course if he does win we'd continue to tradition of collecting one of every kind of president
lori lightfoot sounds like a dnd character name
some right is needed
i don't really see any point to the right
thats why it needs to be fix
what are u gonna do cavity search everyone that comes in
by doing things like, for example, actually doing things with peoples' immigration papers that don't involve filing the away for the rest of eternity
borders would have done nothing to help
which one was i thinking of?
no the last major terrorist attack was by a white guy with an ar-15
thats a lot jeez
what are those reasons?
pick a mass shooting, any mass shooting :(
you don‚Äôt mess with ours
they are a republic
crazy part is people would prob accept an american monarchy
jeff van drew: lemme switch parties because it would get me elected
k bye night
just live in the pokemon center only problem is that's considered illegal
just left zeal
i mean being in that server is like guilt on my shoulders too
people in zeal gettin gyou down?
no gummy but there is massive game stores
so no one pissed you off?
i was pissed but not at anyone
if anything you kept it off of life support
though one question
well it's not even necessarily the president who creates jobs
he's more or less taking credit for what obama did after the great recession
the one thing he hasn't tried to actively dismantle
and those tax cuts trump passed have not in any way helped the middle class like he claims
to what you said earlier
because "don't be annoying" isn't a rule on the books, as you might have noticed
that's good
god damn it now someone's going to have to destroy that also
drago i will destroy your channel!
also drago
both of us, probably
you said i sucked at pokemon
we are watching a vid on the history of coffee in class
lets all move to errr
yeah we were forced to take a christian test in grade 7
i went to catholic elementary and middle school, we had religion class
it was a public school with no religion
fuck
though i did create a channel solely to upload twitch vods
true
probably
also
i was mentioned
let me guess probably negative
no, who is gummyv
i must have missed that
alternately: sufficient, enough
also drago
so im used to their names from the cartoons
i don't think i would recommend doing it right now
do this to charlie
oh my god
i think i have a picture of charlie out and about in the snow just getting covered up
two out of two vets agree
does flubs agree though?
ooo drago
watch this one
god damn it gohan
the internet was a mistake
mitch it's not nice to dare people to kill themselves
actually taht sounds kinda like a frat party
ngl sometimes i do wish pok√©mon was still a small ("small") game made by a team of 30 people
ok so you're echoing me basically
so i guess that's why i haven't liked the games since b2w2
like there were fewer pokemon but didnt black and white do that to?
it's a benedict cumberbatch photoshopped image i think
yeah its not like you play the games for the story
the sheep just kinda hop (heh) in place? and then use the elements to fucking murder eldritch horrors from the earth's past
you knew i was pinning that, come on
...out the butt?
humans generally lay on their backs to make it more like a shit chair if anything
mitch i take it you've never conversed with flubs before
shush mitch
i was more saying that because kugal doesnt really need to know
so i need to work on that
because kugal does too many crimes
we talked abou this already
that's not an option, it has to be one or the other
me me m
he fuckin flipped it on me
i've got exactly $0.50 on my desk
not counting my wallet
ok fine
or something like that
~~yes~~
get mitch to
kugal wanna talk about matrix multiplication?
pokeball plush included
whats the expression?
so i know how to use it for 3d graphics and i know (kind of) how to do it, but i don't exactly see the actual connection between matrix math and 3d graphics
there you are
talking about this penguin
gummy i want that thing to burn, and when it's done burning i want the ashes to burn
drago i've been practicing
gummy it's you versus literally the entire rest of the planet
probably one of my fav straters
only thing i'm prob gonna hate about sinnoh remakes is i'm gonna have to constantly look at what pokemon to catch to use as a hm slave lol
that is my plan to pick piplup as my starter and gummy is prob gonna mop the floor with me cause he felt like flexing that he's beaten the game 10 times lol
technically 20 mitch
it would be kind of funny if the remakes eliminate the whole hm thing entirely
no both
i feel like the surf replacement in swsh should have killed the user instantly
i actually didn't except flubs to be the first person i ever met who agreed with me on hms, but hey
at this point i'm pretty sure hms are a losing battle though, if i want field moves i'll play zelda or something
hey man i expected if people wanted to be horny theyd play zelda but a friend showed me some disturbing stuff recently that proved me wrong. they still play pokemon.
yikes!
on vhs
i always have to have one open whenever i do raids
itd be so easy to remember
someone prob has the brain of a math god while also knowing all the pokemon type advantages and disadvantages while also knowing how to speak a million languages
bringina you have my full support on this mission
i mean i know all of th epok√©.mon matchups, i just dont do the other things
isnt rotom like every type or something
if it's not gonna be sanders the next best choice would have to be biden
riots all over the place
biden has to win south carolina if he's gonna get that far though, not to mention super tuesday
is he the one where theres the audio file of him asking for pants with more dick room
mostly just boring stuff
give that audio a listen. really intriguing
literally just the president of the us asking for pants with more dick room
actually i take back my statement on not viewing any of the conventions in 2016 cause i remember trump's current lawyer was pretty much hyping up the crowd
targeted attack jeez
made the bitch pika cry
i gotta cuddle those cute bois
gummy called pikachu a bitch wtf is this
piplup is a bigger bitch though
omg lol
i love birbs
so blitz
are you ready to be mean?
can i buy drugs from you?
we'd just have normal for the wooloo
gummy let's meet up and eat some hot wings
a gummy and bringina destroying a country movie
im not gonna take an axe to a desk
um aggressiveness...
tom nook for president
the teacher of that class loves me, so her, my boyfriend, and like 5 other students came to defend me
the teacher told us to choose from the answer choices a or b
the teacher said "ok now discuss with someone who chose your answer too why you chose your answer"
and then i said "ah yes, because c stands for 'can't create cool complicated conversations (with other students but sorry i couldn't come up with more words that start with c)'"
how dare you!
and i just ignored them because they are on another level of idiotic, i seriously abhor some students at my school lmao
what you do
go to pax east
once it gets to 100k infected we can officially use this plagues inc style map
this virus reminds me of the black death
well at least you got that right
im in position
we only learned recently that rat fleas were the reason, didn't we?
yes sis
they believe it started in china where rats would then infect traders who would trade with europeans
fuck
which would slow down the virus
hello my fellow gamer
see what happens
but okay i‚Äôll say the n word
sis you are a nerd
idk who that is
our usa president everyone
is getting people to buy his bullshit
where we arent electing the president yet but doing all the setup for that
sis you are a noob
bring back the monarchy!
japan elections go by so quick your like nani
its all about theater here
although the usa doesn't really have an official one
last time people were lining up and walking to canada
i say let them all freeze
aw sorry man
i heard another guy passed away from cancer but i didn‚Äôt even know him as well as this dude
also my headset arrived today
do it flubs
can i trade myself in?
but i like sword
i meant june 2019
i don‚Äôt want the switch
and mitch
i‚Äôll take flubs with me
yeah gummy cant stop time
i meant friday
no one knows what that means...?
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
oh she is cute
damn it, she says don‚Äôt come to russia, but i always wanted to see the russian empire
youre a bit late for that
yea pretty much
flubs no
yea agreed. however his justification for doing it that way was that he teaches like 6 courses a semester, and his hw pile is ginormous, and he's 60 and he's getting more tired as time rolls on
but russia has a government well known for taking the sentiments of the people to heart
anyways back to the e3 joke
true
sadly russia isn‚Äôt as big as it once was
no come back i didnt mean it
night sis! *hugs*
but mitch
hey gummy are you looking forward to april fools day this year?
idk theyll probably announce it at e3 or something
oh seems like corphish is heading to e3
cause corphish
look at his motherboard
and for 2 of them, i knew the answer but my justification for my answers were literally just proofs
build it
while i had 236 subs
i knew him when he had 55 and was annoying :p
lmfao, i'd totally do that proof though
im almost 20
i hate him for making me feel old
stop being almost 20
it definitely works like that
it definitely works like that
he doesn‚Äôt even need it now
i mean
what did happen to some of eyan‚Äôs fanbase?
i gotta add y'all on switch lol
agreed lol
yeah so are 320,000,000 other americans
i mean the numbers are probably off but that sentiment is true
no he isnt
ash for president
same thing for vice president then?
and i feel like i heard there are different ways to make an rng so theyre all different
he's seeding the lottery with the social security number of the previous winner
possible
see thing is a lot of americans wont understand that so it wont be implemented. new things have to be easy and similar to old things or they wont be liked
oh right
or even actual person
are you referring to ke- [drago has died of suicide by a bullet wound in the back of his head]
though once again i don't take this family/sibling/twin thing seriously unless it's sis
it went from a joke to a serious matter
and sis would be disappointed i bs an answer about icelandic canadians
i said some thing was a cake
and i have to take a canadian history
gummy what did you do
i like it still
you sounded a lot crazier back then imo
and i already hit puberty by that vid
i see
and i still do
how dare they
also mitch what if they don't do remakes?
then the sinnoh fandom will be sad
i mean it's still sinnoh
why do you enjoy that episode so much then xd
this was the video i was talking about when we watched that episode lol
i will burn you and the turtle
get me into this chat room
oay blitz
drago
demon lord
i think i have a small form of ptsd?
i cant even tell if gummy is being serious or not at this point
but gums doesn‚Äôt wanna make mood bad
and he doesn‚Äôt want people to feel bad for him, cause thats bad
i love this show
i see
well that was a waste of time
usually the insults are worse
he can smite people at will but not viruses
sounds like an idea
ohhh i hope the next pope is a lady that'd be cool
austria*
italy it ww2 is just sad, austria was jerks i thinj
ww2 bad
also had black racism issues as well
i mean ww1 was bound to happened because tensions
okay flubs
i have no clue
imma get a rat to beat you up
i like this music
this is pretty good
buuny needs his happy meal
almost 4 fucking years
but at 6 am
beat sun and moon
thanks sis
why you up so early?
it's more a challenge of willpower than actually being good at it
and yes that fucking snorlax killed me
i can't sleep because i'm in pain
my throat
drop things?
i'm sipping some tea rn
pokemon moon is helping me a bit with ptsd and my mid life crisis
i mean all i do is go to work, school, home and repeat
years but im finally done, reminds me when i was 16 now almost 20
but night sis! (but this time, i‚Äôm the one going to bed)
drago
after 3-4 years drago
too bad i don‚Äôt have the vids anymore
i think i need another round of olive oil in my ear
sounds fun cause lillie is precious
episode 46!!!!
whew
gummy you have an interetsing concept of "effort"
i was still under the impression of "a month or two" lmao
<a:pawnk:680050332889645108>
gums is a salty marshmallow
it's about robot butts with a side of post-human existential dread and light hack-and-slash mechanics
i don‚Äôt like butts
nier automata is about butts
sylveon is bad and should feel bad
if anyone meaning prob just demon lord wondering about stream
pokemon has been cancelled due to bringina feeling a bit ill
bringy use a potion
shut the fuck up
peal is my favorite game
a peal of a diamond
cause fnatic
yeah
her husband came after me
cause she told me in the dream i got her pregnant
i see
the consequences without the fun
time to stream
won't be there today, this has been a week from hell and i just need it to be over
cheap
i should probably make sure it works before i do anything else
i really like the brick aesthetic
don‚Äôt waste money
i should get one for my father so he can stop playing ps4 and screaming at cod lol
1990: kids screaming at the video games
2020: parent screaming at the video games
good
he even said that this is his 10 times saying that
oh nice
so once they run out of kat capture cards
if i absolutely have to i'll just emulate gba stuff instead of recording it off actual hardware
brb trying something on kelly
he speaks javascript
you're giving me hilarious powers drago
gummy your traffic lights are tilted
and im at work so im not texting and driving
good gummy
no distracted driving
they're fun if you're the one wielding them
never dealth with ruby either
and then i used it for two pok√©mon fan games and slightly-less-than-hated it
i approve
wait that means i might be leading the charge
a darn book
your life is to be around gummy like everyone else
cause gums has no life
can probably pilfer textures from existing things though
also brb
also that new guy in zeal has died already, no surprise there
the markets are plunging
how long do you recommend
and then learning shit through days at his office
whats the lowest i can invest?
how many men must fail for every buffet to succeed
it's also going to be in free fall for a little while, so don't buy anything now
now? the world is your oyster
any tips
okay but like, that's not in my nature lmao
good answer kugal cant have them knowing about our dish sessions
or left politics?
i am
me too
i might just slowly break away from them once hs ends
im an adult
and it'll be awkward
she is a bitch
oh it‚Äôs a she
my bf and i are in a server with her and she always makes us feel bad for interacting together because we're forcing others to "third wheel" yet when she interacts with her bf in there it's 100% fine
ah, double standards
it's never a good idea mentally to wait if someone is getting to you, i realize it may be awkward at grad but you gotta think about you're feeling right now
i think i will
i will do this 100%
delightful person
fuck yeah
oh hey
ash talk
gasp
your life was complete when you made ash. why did you continue?
i left zeal
seems like gumland makes you happy then
this server, though i cant talk here a much, still makes me super happy
okay i feel like shit after that chug
cause gums smart with server
unlike original camelot
im pretty sure people enjoy the political talk and news
plus i can be stupid all i want
politics is just a great source of entertainment
depends master
i am a monarchist, thats no joke
you can go by the form in the channel description or you can go through the full 100 axis
it should take mayb half an hour
how far did you get?
i just started undoing the knot on the friendship
i'll talk when im more rational and when im in a better mood
i think my favorite things so far was learning about linear independence and invertible matrices, and theorems for determinants
which makes a lot of sense
i love partial derivatives
have you got to the chain rule yet with partial derivatives?
here are my gay and my crimes sorry for how long it is :\(
those are all woke as shit
master pls dont make me a communist i like my money
gummy is a monarcho communist
no master
alright?
i am a god in a world of ants
therefore in spite of the contrary contrapositive cross product i must denounce this line of reasoning
it was nice knowing you all
yay?
burn down berlin!
the great thing is that when chaos comes everyone thinks they'll be the king on top and welcome it for that
i welcome the entertainment
i will start a diamond and pearl walkthrough
don‚Äôt wanna delete pearl
i have pirate diamond which is bad
for nostalgia
wonder how long it would take u to finish x or y in a day
wait you can watch me
diamond and pearl would be cool
i want to save platinum for bringy and me
since you have a button where you can speed the game if you want
but i think thats against the rules
i have to maybe buy starlight a new onw
the store used to be less horny
yeah but not in this sad of a manner jesus christ
join the lonely gang. horny gang is stupid
im alone a lot but i feel surrounded by lovely people
save some of it for the rest of us jeez
i didnt realize other people got to weigh in on that
he thinks it's a sin
see that was always my theory about heaven
yes sis, right away sis
sis why are you up?!
lots of loud
fuck
flubs why are you up
so i can get homework done, get ready for the day, exercise, go to class, complete more homework, talk with friends, and then sleep
i exercise for like 3 hours a day
do homework early?
have a skip day for exercise
and get more sleep?
at 4:45
this is amazing
kinda similar to how bringina and gums have each other's back all the time
here is my friend's doggo again, riley, cosplaying as a bun
the cat is like a mom telling you to sleep cause it's a school night
well i do have an exam starting in 7 hours
oh fuck
whaaat u sent girls und panzer content
guys corona is a hoax
i knew it was fake
fuck the unions, get borders or some shit
us presences is gone
imma write a book about it
then we would know your full name lol
yeah i sent it when i said u should do a pokemon spicy food challenge and what inspired me to propose the challenge lol
i don't find it irritating when you guys talk btw, feel free to talk about whatever you want whenever, but they tire me and make me feel inadequate
in other news i'm currently having existential dread over bloomberg seeing any level of success at all
also even though i lean left, i don't like bernie sanders and while he would definitely be better than trump, i don't think he deserves to be president
i get his time on earth is numbered but he seems to be the only one who wants to take on healthcare
fuck
even if his mind is there (maybe) being president is a hard job
ida when i say young i mean "not my grandma's age"
bloomberg might be the worse one nvm
~~michelle obama 2024~~
willingly
i think most people would
i'm curious to see how nuts the republican party will be in terms of elect choices in 2024
i mean in terms of running cause he may want to after trying in 16
yes sis...
you and god must have some connection
i know
i did something stupid
now im sitting in pain
my arms
walmart is whatever though
(it's uphill too)
co worker died
i liked pete until he started roasting people for no reason
but i wanna see him rap the usa problems away
it turns out there's more stuff for him to destroy than he thought
we get slightly more say than the us virgin islands
i would be kinda sad if amy drops out but it's very likely
democratic national convention in the summer
i don't see trump changing vice presidents
the only woman to hold office in canada is crazy as fuck
regardless if it's biden or sanders, i think they would be smart to pick kamala harris
that's my hope anyway
and in bernie's case it may be good for him to have a more moderate running mate
yeah
does it count the amount of times i think to myself "fucking shit" whenever i see anything in my inbox?
i guess punch, not kick. but you get the spirit
and sis said i was violent and evil
so suddenly decking a child is "evil"
kids are evil, they deserved it
he was undying people and stuff tho
good job argo
thonk
seems like 1.5 instances
ok something is off
you ever wonder what counts as asking for too much?
e!bot
there it is
e!bot
because it's 7:46 pm
glad i could help :\)
im not quite sure im still trying to figure that out
or imaginary
oh ok great
they should just give it back to cartoon network
he destroyed them. oh god
drago, how?
wait i wanna hear lewd joke
the lewder the better
we should probably stop talking about skarm now
what if youre the new guy?
more training is needed
i am skarm
how the fuck do they poo
i'd rather have someone who can beat trump than someone who agrees with me
it's pretty much biden vs sanders not sure why warren is still going but ok
dad: "i hope warren stays in the race and keeps siphoning votes from sanders"
that
is it? what does it taste like? my world currenly tastes like the week-old mystery meat from the school cafeteria
for me it was theodore roosevelt
i don't think putin can run next election
what *are* bollocks, anyway
theyre the bits inside the dangly thing beneath the dong
science!
its actually both
because i do
dragonitespam vs supergummying
charlie would lose
but charlie is tough
no he is a wuss
mustton not now
yeah that's about how i feel too
i‚Äôll get back in the swing of that game once i get my life in check
was there something wrong with supergummying?
was there anything _not_ wrong with supergummying?
flubs ask drago
first off, the one you'll come to know during your travels around limsa lominsa
y'shtola rhul
smart and sassy, big fan favorite
next up, the one drago may have encountered
it's been a long time since i did the ul'dah starting quests
papalymo's the brains of the duo, yda's the ditz who can punch stuff well
balloons?
that animal thing sis
it's
that's its pom
i don't think we do though
i finally did it
yes im perfectly sane
don‚Äôt judge me
what is this?
sounds church medieval
it's a realm reborn's theme
there's these stages called the coils of bahamut that are split into 3 parts
that's the guy that nuked eorzea
are you calling me slow?!
epic
well so far it looks like reviews for mystery dungeon are mixed
yeah but dont they usually explain them?
i feel like they will
or are those not out yet?
ngl i'm probably top three in the list of eyan twitch regulars of all time
thats fuckin crazy
man thats a huge change
but man the forums changed a lot
if change is inevitable then that will one day change and change will become impossible
to be fair ash rained hell there too
and they did get in here
time to write something in the chat
i got news
oh yea i found out about that when i woke up
i'm curious to see who she's gonna endorse
it's just nuts that the most diverse list of candidates now boils down to two old white men
they worry the young will party and do nothing
obama
people
hot coffee it is
hi sebastian
no becasue you're incompetent
lgbtq rights even though canada already has that
so bernie
yes you can be anti abortion but pro choice
i do believe biden wants the 15 dollar wage
i am against it but i don't give a fuck about what you do
reduce greenhouse gases
dismantle the electoral college and maybe modify the senate and house
and tries to get me to buy it
instead of putting addicted people in jail
as for international stuff
america
this
i fucked up
argo my sister and i have began adapting that song to be about our dog
meanwhile
shall i direct him to the zeal server master?
basically my me as my oc, and well what do you guys think?
that was decisive
remember the days when you had to wait months for a game to be localized from japanese to english?
guys
which is better?
argh
dunno
in my pc
i found out that i had recorded a video of me playing league in 2015
so i guess i was playing league while watching eyan and recording?
it's not embarrassing
it's not
cause it was only my gameplay
that is so me
what you think sis?
look at then
how dare you!
how dare you call her creepy
i have been officially offered and accepted part time permanently at my workplace!!!
nice work gums!
fuck that
fool
i also need to buy um
i guess maybe another ssd
<:cozynotevil:585599397954322453>
no and no
also how to properly ignore you without letting on that im ignoring you
flubs i looked back at my dms
idk how you haven‚Äôt left gumland left
i clearly told you i got banned
it‚Äôs ponies
i just dont look at it
if that
tbh it‚Äôs been less ponies lately since show ended
back in zeal server you were there when 20 people talked
now ive got hobbies and stuff. reading, putting blood in my system from my bones, that stuff
yeah but i dont like vc as much since i cant talk
woah
i want in on the blood hobby
start of original skype group
i do respect you guys will call me out on my shit
i don‚Äôt like t
fuck i don‚Äôt remember how to spell it
i used to be like that
i am gummy
im not smart enough to know if thats healthy or not but my gut says no
im gummy not eric
bringy
yeah
i think its more common to not be that different online. im just weird
for the rest of you...
yeah but itd be violent
not drago
seriously, what a guy
every time he talks it just brightens your day, y'know?
but let's playing is kind of dying anyway so yeah
demon lord let's plays aren't going to die until i say they can die
it'll be like vods but maybe a bit more compressed or something
nah man we should always talk about kugal
now he's going to want to be unduly nice to everyone >:(
and i'm just kind of here, i don't know why lol
everyone here is rad as shit
drago^. 5
earlier today i think it was
alright here it is
this is why nerds have the best jokes
why is no one a suck up to me?
hence its racist
be loyal to me
and you get this
i get it
it‚Äôs not that hard
doesn't have to be anything too fancy
maybe
but he does genuinely seem to want to do something with his community
would be uploading
they're the ones that matter at this point
same sis
yeah i don't blame you there
also probably making camelot/gummyland may have made the other community harder...
eh it was bound it happened sooner or later, i always had the revive camelot plan in my head
the secret to success in zeal server is have that one active person
i don't know who else could pull that off though
flubs
also he won‚Äôt get in trouble cause it‚Äôs been over two years
he only claim i dated someone in the server when i did not
gummy is roughly equal to one $60 video game
im working on new horizons plans
i wanna see gummy unbox something for some reason
i could send him a horse head in the mail as a threat
he even voice cracks in the intro
gummy how does it feel knowing the only time ive really visited your channel(s) was to delete them
which flubs
for some weird reason i find his commentary relaxing
also mitch i can vc you soon
i mean it‚Äôs not lazy to hang around with me?
man i gotta go from over here to click on the stream and pause the thing im doin and then stay engaged bc i like talkin and blah blah blah
you are lazy
>  i'm still binging drago's sun and moon let's play lol
why lol
because you said my stream was good
"awoo" -charlie, when asked about his thoughts on gummy
take a video and ask him
wait he disappeared?
he's probably outside sleepin on his bed
what else is new
oh guys
it sucks and i hate it
i know you all don‚Äôt watch my streams  but is it bad or good that i keep a stormy profile pic somewhere on the overlay?
thanks guys
im trying to promote bacon
early morning roast
i would forget an email and password after 1 hour?
there is now a third hand sticking out of my butt
maybe
is corona that bad in australia
i've seen conspiracies from the kids were props , adam lanza not even existing and even the school never even existing
flubs shut up, birds are divine beings and you know it >:^(
i could make a few different jokes about having a third hand sticking out of my butt and they're all in varying degrees of poor taste
drago the government hasnt been based off of a mandate of heaven for like 30 years man
theyre just watching us from on high, mocking us mortals for making such a spectacular mess of everything
something something prismo something something monkeys paw
alright kiddos
now from the word of our sponsor
<:wheeze:633688061145907232>
my thing? mens' fashion
ie suits
i give you a b-
thanks teacher drago
flubs will be out to dinner right now
but when hes home he prolly wont be
guys
you get a lot of viewers
but i did all i can and i only slept a few hours
flubs you don‚Äôt even go out to eat
yeah you were streaming
and so i will
its late shut up
10:30
sylveon is number 6
man im an adult ive got responsibilities and jobs
(original plan was for them to take turns but he ended up playing the whole thing)
also seems like he is now a streamer
i watched a few of her vids as well
its your body youre killing
sounds pretty good
though im getting tired of mcdonalds
and my health ain't good for deep fry stuff all the time
also flubs
flubs
or stardew valley
give me stream criticism
and don't be like drago and say it sucks and i hate it
it sucks and i love it
flubs your taste is the shit
yeah it was good
only complaint is that there was only 1 flubs in chat and thats not really on you
well flubs
i might get it and stream it
2 more followers and i get 100
i have never seen a leader do that before
were you even out today?
fuck you twitter
guys i just figured something out
i kinda just wanted to meme a bit
exactly lol
and if you have no clue why lately i been thinking about youtube and twitch is ever since i got that last supergummying channel banned, i been watching my old vids again
thanks goodness i pre ordered the animal crossing switch
no one saw
okay
i dont understand but i appreciate it
i only have one sis!!!
seriously
i don‚Äôt know...
lets just forget all of that sis
nothing suspicious
(i have the game though)
don‚Äôt know
for real tho i'm pretty sis doesn't rate me bad
but wait
don't get my advice on a speech
start off with "animal crossing rules!
scream animal crossing and promote my social media
try not to be nervous
unless if there'd be like
brother im workin
damn it lol
tomorrow likely
take a guess
and nope
and it ain‚Äôt animal crossing either
i feel like i don't know the switch's library well enough
same tbh
mario bros. u
yeah that's a good choice
mario maker 2
yeah but mario day is tomorrow
yoshi's crafted world i believe
i really liked watching chugga first luigi mansion
right dragonite? right? _looks at his steam backlog_
second game i watched
also im not bringing back ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up kiddies‚Äù
don't be like spongebob
this streaming is fun
even though mccann scared away many viewers
that doesn't even make any sense
demon lord lets plays arent allowed to die until i say they can die
i told him not to scare away my viewers
sis he was like one of my only friends back then
yeahh ‚Äúfriends‚Äù
and then skip a few years i only mostly listen to sis
<:stormfallsad:648984424251129898>
oh..
what do you mean by that though?
it took me months to warm up to flubs
very simple with blitz and demon lord, trusted them right away
wooo
we had a vote
we also wanted sis
as you can see, she was the wise of the two of us
iirc i didn't accept until cuddles told me to go ahead
i think schools in indianapolis have closed
my dad wants me to now be a game maker
back then he hated people making games
nah sis
i like him but imma try to avoid his bad gambling addiction in the future
i have never
because i never say anything about him thats chill
also same on subway
when the subway has burned a hole in your colon and youve got nobody to beg forgiveness of
with meat and vegetables in it
because i wanna play with it? i thought you guys know me well at this point
i probably still beat you in the all-time password used category honestly
i would have beaten drago
there was the really bad one
and then there was the regularly bad one
and then my current one is sub-par
but i have some ranch left over
gamestop has been gunning hard for stuff that can't be sold digitally lately
the last time i went into one it was like 40% actual games, it was weird
yeah i know they reorganized the one down at the mall in my area lately
ooo bringy
so basically the only social media i have is the gummy twitter
facebook sucks
guess it could be considered that
what else am i supposed to do watch black and white hahahaha
hoenn
implying that i'm worrying xd
and if he says that, then maybe they don't exist in the timeline
like x and y?
it was
gen 7 is really good
when you are playing it feels like it's going pretty fast
i agree sis
gen 8 is a mess
is slow
~~yeah because even mitch can beat it~~
i once saw somebody say if they enjoy gen 8 then they aren't a true pokemon fan because real fans would boycott the games lol
probably worse than gen 6
i changed my mind, pok√©mon should die so that all these awful people are forced to go do something else with their lives
gummy now has to come out of the closet
yeah
she is great
you are no lord
my very first switch game
nope i think i was actually doing it pretty well
how awesome
that sounds like rabbits are made of quite a few indigestible decomposing biochemicals
does that change actually do anything
whaaat
remember the director who had batman nipples and stuff?
and apparently he claim in an interview
he had sex with over 20,000 men in his life time
50 years
so he purposely had butt shots and bat nipples to show he was gay...
imagine being gay and sleeping with a famous dude
he made a great movie
guys
he started youtube like in 2014/2015 and made meme vids and other things and he was super hyper and shit
people make it look easy to get subs
i killed 15
oh my god
come on, you know i had to look for the pony version
i love the fact they chose rules of rarity
>why was i the only one who failed
bringy told me this and i think sis told me this before
lmao
bella stop being my friend in 2016 so i deleted my account
wonder when eyan will figure out that youtubing doesn't really work anymore
i made a 3ds pok√©mon hacking video in 2016 that randomly started being relevant in february
hey gummy i have an idea
it's probably too late for this year, i'd take like 8 months to render
preparing switch streams won‚Äôt be easy
wrong
that probably explains my paranoia
i swear imma punch this girl in my class
her smile annoys me
guys
and was i drunk when i made this?
wait that's you?
hes fucking op
drago how the fuck does ash have gengar and a dragonite
because ash is a god ever since winning the league lol
i've been trying to avoid spoilers of the gen 8 anime but i'm always curious and i keep getting comic book.com articles about it lol
the man is fucking op
and lost hard
so hes motivated now
this is new
lmao
what a time to be alive
im here to make a new bet with demon lord
apparently his dragonite hugs him a lot
if ash wins i'll donate $50 to you gummy
the stakes have been raised
tempting
all right then
ep 16
ash will beat leon
or wait
let's say win the league
if i can binge watch at the end of hoenn
all the way to sinnoh
you won't make it
why are you going from johto all the way to sinnoh but skipping kalos xd
tbh it would be neat to watch sun and moon with you and bringy
~~wonder why you aren't watching unova hmmmmm~~
already seen ti
officially?
how come wow
never thought i would ever see e3 being cancelled
no...
someone posted a slavery meme
and batmans have nipples
like this
what is pokemon?
wait
what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object
i already watched batman with you
what would be cool though is if all three of us were available come the time the gen 8 anime comes out in english it would be fun to watch together
sleep early
says the person who wants to do their own pokemon binge
since everyone here is nice
what‚Äôs my most close to lewd but safe pic i have....
i wonder would you get banned from discord if you posted straight up porn?
yeah
yeah
which was good
even though it‚Äôs suggestive as fuck
safe tags
yeah
like i don't consider that nsfw in the slightest, but just err on the side of caution
\||do this  \||
when you post the image click the spoiler option
fuck
there
||dawn is best girl||
fuck no
cause knowing bunni and flubs
flubs is just going to post nightmare fuel
i fucking let tenda talk about like collars and shit in gummyland the other day
i have a feeling it's going to end up with <#542191633391681556> as high-quality shitposting and <#677000135552532500> as low-quality shitposting
and other lewd things
why not just call it safe for shitposts
there
that's a better name
general can be where i post my ponies as always
oh guys
tbh we barely use any of the channels here outside of this one
~~actually i everything for you behind the scenes~~
what are you talking about, i posted math porn
frickin
much better
close enough
i think i ran into ida in summer 2014 or so but it might have been 2015
good memories back then
i need to sleep
in zeal server?
not even drago figured me out fast
not around

no lol
that would put you somewhere around 11 am on december 30
it is safe to post
i like bossing people around
whats that
that way it'd be an actual rainbow, but never be like dark gray or anything
put that on dev
there's a hsv to rgb equation that i dont remember off the top of my head
jello dropped by stream last weekend
and he doesn't bother to talk to me!
jk jk
probably helped that eyan was streaming in the afternoon
i think the manechat split changed a lot
and stay in contact with just like sis or something
then now we are here
now to post rarity pic again
now where was i?
trump is huffing and puffing
winning the hurt game what did u do
i believe it was
nope
i heard they were going to close events to the public but good lord
i wonder if baseball season's going to go the same way
lets hope they don‚Äôt cancel lol esports
online or in person?
make of this what you will
that was last week
i'm honestly freaking out
they need to just cancel the olympics at this point
hmmm
if it did that, i have a feeling we'll know prettg quickly
china? of course not
those two arent one and the same, but high propagation can lead to higher mortality rate due to cases overflowing the healthcare infrastructure and having more hosts for a chance to mutate from
i love the chicken video
that was one funny outtake
no joke
today we had a midterm, and if fucked over everyone
oh a character
im a little worried
mean to gym leader
i don't
thanks gummy love you
bully flubs
i mean you did call me a fat kid 4 minutes ago but sure
i didn't i was talking about something else üò¶
it feels like the world is ending
whats it on
another friend took it and is now at a middle d, after getting 37%
right exactly
ultra sun never fails to trigger me
guys
also my prime minister wife has a fever and may have gotten the virus
how am i crazy?
remember i also work in a gun store as well
because they all had something special
it was only until...
after the whole bella mess that my personality shifted to an ‚Äúi don‚Äôt care what you guys do‚Äù
just because other people are crazier doesn't mean you're not crazy
or anything that is muzzleloading
better not touch na lol esports
wonder how mad canadians are
i would expect esports to take a bit
the lol world championships this year are hosted in china
in fact every major crowd gathering will most likely take a hit
how ironic
and this year....
puppy is the ultimate weapon
and ace attorney
well then ill just play it myself, who knows when capcom finally announces aa7
also
anyways sis do you not trust me to not skip over the text fast or something?
just lock canada down
dad got back from work
carrying loads of bags
its on fire
i learnt leadership from medieval era
did u wonder why the medieval style of leadership doesnt exactly exist anymore, theres *probably* a good reason why people moved on to different kind
medieval stuff is cool
flubs ain‚Äôt happy
give me
<:ponkstare:632354529475559454>
mouth masks aren't great because your eyes are also an entry point. full face masks work better but usually run on filters that cost $80 and last 24 hours
might just be a different country thing then
for you did people with glasses not need any goggles at all?
yes that is what i meant, maybe my wording was off
air is for losers
biochemistry needs gloves much more than goggles anyway. people in analytics course might be usin them for some specific classes tho, if i had to hazard a guess
you are not kirby
bringy, i was a smart teenager
see teens will be stupid either way
a kid at my high school was doing a demo in physics where you put water on a glass plate and whip it around in a circle
gummy is fiction
bringina is like courtney isn‚Äôt she?
she talks like a robot
<:ponkjudgesu:525085042532417576>
new estimated delivery date:
thursday, march 19, 2020 - wednesday, march 25, 2020
thats sad
you are bad at knowing the leaders
draw bacon
it's my current twitter banner
huh never thought i would see somebody say the r word in manechat
we saw it this morning
i'm waiting for news to come out saying trump has corona because it wouldn't be a shock at this point when he came in contact with the brazil president
anyone > trudeau
yes he prob would
this entire pandemic will be trump's downfall in november because it's a common thing in history where the current president in a crisis usually gets voted out in the coming election
people would still vote for him
that's the messed up part there are people that still support him it makes me sick
dunning-krueger effect, i think
hes incompetent
will there be a carbon tax?
so i spent about 19 years
i'd rather be under canadian consveratives
you sure about that?
i found this good boy in a local video game store today.
they seem more tolerable than american ones
i feel like
did u travel recently to high risk areas? if not stop bein paranoid, wash ur hand, avoid people and monitor ur condition
yeah i should be safe
i just worry because of this morning when saskatoon said they had their first case
especially crazy college student
only problem im gonna have is getting to my office in the city
the governor declared a state of emergency
granted, i doubt "slowing the spread" is going to even put a dent in the load on the hospital system, considering that a lot of them are already bursting at the seams even during non-virus times
yeah it helps but i got a job man
what's good for the corporations is good for the people, obviously
and anything good for me is good for anyone else
seems like my next con may not happen then...
ye i dont recommend goin there evwn if it were to happen
i'm probably gonna skip going home for easter or for my siblings' birthday
nah there's about a hundred known cases
wait a vaccine was made in my province?
yeah that's why i shared this here specifically
it's still in the testing stages
because its a virus, isnt it gonna mutate and shit?
what makes it boring
lack of sheep farms apparently
e!bot
tomorrow is a sad day
why?
come on demon lord, i expected you to know this
it's finally over
then we move on the switch briefly
at least i finished a pokemon game on stream*
well thats more of a side game
so funds are for animal crossing
even though work starts at 5
you won't be the only one
so i prob won't take a day off
arriving 19 mar - 25 mar
this is treason!!1
lol i mean unless you want to sit in your room and play fortnite all day getting partnered is not really achievable
just have a decent following and active, you can email them
blitz
i don't think my banner who bringina will draw will be done
of course it will
um demon lord, im trying to look like a pro here, not a child
<:stpc_ppyum:480683453071884318>
my dad says trump is brave for not isolating himself
because he isn't afraid
insert italian joke here
...not that im in the mafia
sounds like something that a member of the mafia would say
okay
watch this clip if you can of new new spongebob
its better than season 5-7
it's nice to see them with a more fleshed out personality
4 am
"you can kill me, but you'll never find the sarin gas canister i placed in the president's fridge. shit."
there's way better reasons than that to kill amazon
what are your reasons?
it's owned by a dirtbag, for one
oh yes
i hate that guy
"i'm sorry to know that your pre order item that is to be delivered today has not shipped yet. please do not worry, i'll check the details and try my best to help you."
i am gonna burn all of amazon down
i take back everything i just said
i like these people for getting me free shit
still, its standard
my pleasure
gen 7 just hates me for whatever reason
oh god random encounters in gen 7
i think you would have enjoyed them more than sun and moon
that means its lewd
i never said that
flubs
that's what i've told him
i think it's funny and bad
but my dad says sanders is a godfather
i mean you always gotta call one candidate a communist and of them all, sanders is the communistist
~~trump is a communist~~
he‚Äôs a fascist
fascism is you obey the state no matter what, communism is an economic theory
the thing is communism is a good idea
xi is a robot, change my mind
but also, he's a robot
like i said
the world should have stayed like monarchy
i mean bacon seems to be workin for ya
yeah
i also believe in equity
like, i dont even have that much money and i dont like giving it to people
my workplace is going crazy over the workplace
i need to clean everywhere
clean
bidets are cool but if i have to take an active role in cleaning my ass and im not given a buffer, thats a crime against humanity
like with detergent or something
it's easy to clean just by being in the shower
toilet paper doesn't work just use wet wipes or shower
if you can see through the paper it might as well not be there
what did you do to deserve that
so i gave her more than what she expected
so one kid thought i was him
not that you were a nazi and bad at hiding it, that you were actually hitler
im pretty sure i acted nothing like a nazi back then, and im pretty sure i still don‚Äôt act like one to this day
napoleon is not a nazi
my credit card just notified me
and said $480.55 has been charged on it
fuckkkk
with the coronavirus
they need it for bathroom breaks
i would just say what i've been saying about it
it happened here as well
i've been
maybe it‚Äôs the virus?
and having to do so many things
and going home just has that worry that i might be infecting my family
then there's easter
you have a time limit and they say the basic things that i already know
yeah i know
i think so
well if i was you and i feel good to where i know i don‚Äôt have the virus, then i would go home
oh shoot, hopefully they get unblocked soon
thanks both
being around family will always lighten the mood
your brothers prob miss you, and well from what you told me, i don‚Äôt think the virus will be an issue
i think im one of the few people though that can‚Äôt be around family that long cause fights breakout
gummy you have the ability to make your little sister immediately vacate the room? god i wish i could do that
every two months or so
wait
and still drive more
i need like at least 2 days of rest before making the return trip
could you
at this point im literally used to it
e!google ecs
entity-component systems are basically an alternate philosophy to object-oriented programming
i'd like to make those basically anonymous functions
at least trudeau actually cares about the people
interesting
trump doesn't care about the middle class only the rich though
trump doesn't care about the middle class, or the part of the upper class who didn't vote for him
trump said once neo nazis and people defending against them had good people on both sides
only once?
and the fact that he admitted there may have been fine people on the "not literal nazi" side is pretty good, on his standards
i can imagine when trump is no longer president the days of not experienced candidates being elected will be over
i want this man as president
jean-christophe
i was elected as emperor of gummyland
dunno
daily streaming hasn‚Äôt been going well since i took a tiny break on thursday
today was a good day
hello blitzypoo
it uh, did not go well
it‚Äôs gonna be a quick animal crossing stream
<#580946892201000960>
well you've got six days
i hear eyan wants to play animal crossing
yes....they replaced the mlp show
but it‚Äôs cute
want me to class-ize the commands first?
look at the block looming over function masseffect in the master branch
yeah something like that
i don't really care
oh yoiu mean a different welcome message for each guild
so instead of this
recursion is limited to 2000 characters
hang on this shoudl actually be pretty easy now that i think about it
wait is bot not a global const?
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
was it?
what can bot actually do?
actually now that i think about it
e!skarm
interesting
i'll do that after i get the existing ones up and running in the new format
but i still have to do cashier work
yeah i guess
i decided yesterday to work from home for a while. theres been enough cases on li and in the city for me to be concerned
what, did they wear gloves for once?
and washed their hands
i keep thinking im sis with my profile pic
who is she?
oh her!!
out of all the games you showed me, it‚Äôs my fave
im currently team flare aliana
none of them have eyes
why does that guy look like a lion
why cant pokemon characters look normal
the most useless champ is hau
like why cant the champion just be some person who wears pants and a shirt? why they all gotta have wings and lion hair
true
this is my favourite champion
objectively wrong
as for me i decided to order a copy of final fantasy vi on the gba
still waiting on trump to get tested and btw trump said he shouldn't be held responsible for his handling of the virus
from what i heard biden gave a better speech on the virus than trump did
and thatd be sick
if biden is elected we would prob have an obama coalition again
id take any obama as vp really
i think it's likely his running mate will end up taking over the ticket in 2024 assuming he wins
ive read reports hillary could be a vp
he's gonna be too old to run for a second term
...could he make trump his running mate?
im not saying he should or would im just wondering if its allowed
nah i think that was before he was speaker
cool
first rule as vp, no white house!
the more gothic and mysterious
this actually can represent me well
the outside is very dull and mysterious
get to know me more and im well like this
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
so the extreme right guy and me agreed on some things...
but then we found something we didn‚Äôt agree on
all prisoners should be executed for population control
dear god
don‚Äôt care if they are innocent or the crime
we must kill some innocent for population control
like...ok murder sure, i disagree but i get it. but...stealing some food? kicking a swan in the fuckin face? you get killed for that shit too
i decided to play left today
for me i also agree with death penalty only for those proven for sure guilty
he had to have been trolling
i hope so
he‚Äôs not trolling
he‚Äôs an old guy
what the hell
he's messed up in the head
if you had the views of kim running for pm in canada i would cut ties with you and leave
now hes concern because trumo is concern
he‚Äôs the extreme canada right
however
ironic that it's called the people's party when most of the people apparently have far right views
he‚Äôs trying to get me to move to the right
but we will see
i love to see a different view
he says sanders is communist
though he doesn‚Äôt think biden is mafia
well
precisely what about gas cars are the best
whats going on tonight?
> my dad also believes kim jong un should run canada
i changed my mind, i think gummy's dad is the one who was dropped as a baby, not gummy
they are central
ndp and green are left
like where they say men shouldn‚Äôt exist
i can‚Äôt wait for the gun counter dude to come back for our next debate
and air pollution
woah woah..i only kinda support them**
i don‚Äôt fully support them, thats a difference
claim the economy's great and people believe him
he isnt one to lie
then again, sis doesn‚Äôt want a cool castle
~~yes gummy but that's because i'm actually capable~~
i think
when i get back on final fate
thats not fair or true mitch
yall talk too dang much
he takes the blame for the good stuff
real
gummy i could literally push you over and you wouldnt be able to do anything about it
you said creative costume, huh
prob sis
~~besides gummy cause i know he doesn't like good games~~
but i've watched an entire let's play of it, though it doesn't count for much
well i've heard it's one of the best games ever so i'm looking forward to playing it
no screw off, bot
i believe he told me it was alabama
the animal crossing hype is real
one of you guys told me i had cancer cause a cat sniff me
the cat detecting it
or the cat causing it?
i believe it was your cat in the dream sis
i had a dream that i drove my mom's van through the wall of the house once
i also had a dream where i ordered a pizza with a coupon
so i ended up eating everything
that's just like when my cat could detect cancer in my mom before she was even diagnosed
cats are something special, that's for sure
canada or at least here has a lot of young conservatives
jesus didn't know alot of people hate living in saskatchewan
wtf why does everyone wanna separate from canada
mitch imma tell you something surprising
how come they voted him back in
that's what i said when i did some reading up on scheer
yes to an extent mitch
it wasn‚Äôt that mitch
that was the issue
he tax people on gas to help stop climate change but did the opposite with that
btw mitch
that's a good man right there
trudeau is reminding me of trump alot a bit
trudeau is still way better
i go back to my argument saying people can hate politicians all they want but it's a needed qualification
first off, no lgbt discrimination
women will also have equal pay
i think the thing with pollution
is to really shut down anyone dumping waste in the ocean
same
i saw plastic bags flying everywhere
which makes it harder for me
difference is
a musket can shoot down like one person a minute, if you get lucky with your aim and don't get interrupted reloading
i also wanna go hunting
instead of jail
this would stress me out a lot
what im worried about is
those are my policies if i had absolute power
what you guys think?
international it goes all the way back to medieval times to napoleonic times to well everywhere
also yes...i would probably wanna build a gothic castle for myself. i like to make it represent me
i also kept other things we have talked about
what about boris johnson
drago
how dare they! first my monetization, then my annotations, now my classic studio?!
no you beat them to that one
where everything is now circle
thats my new channel
~~who said it was your channel~~
we share here
im not crazy im deranged
i am gonna buy a new toy
"hey its donald trump" dragonite
mine is better!!
now thats a good wedding
also you'd have to actually play the game
then i can play
never accept food from strangers
everyone
biden says he will choose a woman if he is nominated
*cough* gummy
from what i've seen of your sun and moon let's play you are pretty good lol and your overlay was better than his
is that the one i used viner hand itc all over the place
flubs do i sound more or less nasally in your head
ive heard the voice but its gone man
nightshade sounds german?
idk she sounds kinda american to me almost
according to you i sound depressed so i dont trust you gummy
she sounds american
i just have a typical canadian voice
not my junk just my miscellaneous air parts
my maternal grandfather was from scotland though
why do they have an in with isis
gummy if you didnt already not trust uberfacts as a source, theyre either terrorists or liars
my mom and dad said isis is smarter than canadians
sometimes we stay away from the things we like because they suck. uberfacts is worse than meth
and even if its true what does that even mean
he misses flubs
not today though because i killed my voice already
flubs
guys
from what i hear republicans are mad
and mitch, trudeau won‚Äôt annex usa
he would make the stock market crash worse
ndp will rise in canada the great jagmeet singh will become leader
no sis
i would have fucking believed it
cnn?!
then you have parents threaten to bring students to teachers if schools closed down
canada's education system is as corrupt as you can get
it was all just stuff you had learned already, completely pointless
lpt: never call something a "literacy test" its got a nasty past
no we did, that was just an extra requirement you had to do
yeah
i'm so lost when people talk about education systems cause it's so different here most of the time
because everyone's related
lets go back to this youtube business
alright new supergummying channel
thats the point sis
oh bringy, don't look as well
the last time i told bringy this joke, she used a squirt bottle of me
a squirt bottle
americans are the least prepared
fucking idiot
never thought i would ever see canada close borders
hopefully when the virus ends they reopen
thatd be good. no more canada
flubs
that makes sense actually
im still waiting for power abuse here!!
don't compare me to that movie
i am stagerring five feet one inch
as long as my head doesnt get used as a arm rest by taller person again im good
> as long as my head doesnt get used as an arm rest by taller person again im good
you never told me story
i grew enough to be able to reach top of most lab tables without help, thats all i need
rat attack
but tune in tomorrow maybe?? for pokemon finale
only one thing can protect
the rat
how tall are you again?
i thought you were 185 cm
i also have hand sanitizer
oh sis, i got this toy
i think i know why i like playing with toys, it‚Äôs my happy spot in brain
my little sis and me are at our worse today in terms of insult
guys
he called it the "chinese virus"
plus i might be a target
probably the first, knowing people
im scared to cough in public cause i don‚Äôt wanna start a public meltdown
guys im stupid
no sis..but i tend to chew on a lot of things
he's old, i bet she could make it look like an accident
why doesn't she just leave him tbh
yeah politicians have been pointing their guns at end-to-end for ages now
so thats why the cs people want cs courses in k-12
it's animal crossing
what you expect
i already threw two temper tantrums at amazon
that person lives in canada
you will with an alligator
the alligator would just increase the potential of the virus to mutate
no no, the alligator is your pet
they don't give a shit
doesnt mean the alligator wont eat all of my bones
good luck drago
i think it's implying to stay safe and look out for others during the coronavirus
because i am preparing to call amazon
you don't get it here in america if you are poor and can't pay taxes you are punished but if you are swimming in cash they don't care if you don't pay
we all know trump doesn't unless it seems so because he doesn't want to release his tax returns
indian outfit
saying you wear it for ceremonies
guess he went to india and dressed up for it
it was a business trip not a vacation
but he met the indian prime minster
good news
that's good
i should cancel switch
and buy a normal one
would think gamestop would restock them when the game comes out
i‚Äôm calling amazon today
like they told me...
i should have bought switch at chick fil a
lol i'm ever gonna beat gen 7
‚Äújust shoot everyone with the virus‚Äù - little sister today
its too late for that to work now
well she just took scissors and pretended to stab me
itai no wa iya nano de bougyoryoku ni kyokufuri shitai to omoimasu 
is the japanese name, the translated one is also stupidly long and i don't have that in front of me rn
well that wasn't very nice of her
congrats
.....gummy play emerald next so wingulls can still terrorize u :>
you should be a pokemon boobie streamer xd
stormy would hate me if she saw i suggested that
she would love it
something about the eues
i'm amazed gummy was able to beat him because he is literally impossible
well it did take like 40 minutes and four attempts even with two people so...
i've attempted it twice and haven't gotten one attack off
.....
hey at least i didn't ignore pokemon refresh
i am very happy my first true series on stream is done
animal crossing doesn't count
will be either platinum or danganronpa
danganronpa 2 has a russian roulette scene
what is that?
don't read the comments, spoilers
sis, permission to burn jeff guy who owns amazon?
dont listen to her gummy you dont need a good reason to set someone on fire
and anywhere you are is a good place to go if you want to practice social distancing
time to make youtube vids again i guess
uh ff6 is a good game, some would call it the best game ever made
i can no longer play animal crossing
cause ama fucking zon
agreed
rumors are sanders may suspend tonight
i never thought i would say this but i think biden has a legit shot at beating trump given the virus situation or if anything it would be a very close race
if bernie loses arizona i won't be stunned if he suspends
i'd expect a suspension from campaign between 1500-1800 delegates, but they may go until the bitter end if the desire of the people is seen as more valuable than unification behind the abstract of a party
oh shit
its funny
what is wrong with you like give me a break
just looked biden won
join!!!
im playing destiny üò¶
join and listen while playing?
playing destiny with chaps
i dont appreciate it
how about in an hour?
probably actually
our units are cooler because one of them is named after a part of the body
the only good imperial units are liquid measure
also here's the reason to play ffxiv
you gotta think what's more important to the consumer specs or how the console looks so i know my entertainment center can fit it
107 followers on twitch
your regularly scheduled cynicism will resume shortly
honestly don't know how you managed to do it but you did
10% of the followers are friends, the rest are random
i think i managed to get up to 40 followers on twitch and like . . . 35 of them were friends
so, yeah
streaming in the afternoon is the best
dude...you known me for like 4 years
why do you think i want you to do it
well no!
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
and i bought my capture card and everything
i don't have a switch at all
i meant your wii u and whatever
wii u is sold
if you wanted to put that through an elgato you'd need to get a hdmi converter
maybe you have one that can take the funny tv cables that the wii uses
btw this site still has 2ds xl capture cards
mine besides a tiny circle pad issue
[looks at his 3ds perched precariously on a pile of handheld electronics and a copy of hitchhiker's guide]
maybe i should order one
but idk
dont you already have a 3ds capture card?
i break everything i touch
so maybe i should order another one just in case it blows up on me
finally
so yesterday was my last stream of ultras sun and i caught 6 legendaries in poke balls
when was the last time you caught a legendary in a poke ball?
oikay
it's part of a fan-made mod
you have to press start, select, l and r right before the pok√© ball shakes for the third time
that resets the game
no it doesnt shut up
dammit stormy
what no i meant for the ability to throw pok√© balls
or was it hg
welp
pokepark is kinda meh, i think the first game was better than second
what did rainy have to say?
what, a third pokepark game?
what the frig is pokepark
think it's a troll article
ah yeah it looks like bs
guys
oh flubsss
i mean it depends on how you define productive and like the job and probably the day or how interested the person is
like ive had a very light day today, i pretty much just played destiny after i got all my morning work done and now im starting to work again
that just seems like a bad business decision
too bad you weren‚Äôt close by, i wouldn‚Äôt mind letting you borrow mine
and to think i would cancel it
though getting some kind of apprenticeship with a computer company might be possible, given that i'm planning to study compsci
fun fact, i don‚Äôt want to be a teacher or go to uni but i have no choice
i do want to be an author
yeah
btw guys
oh congrats!
a lot of things
ooo but
it's very bad in italy apparently hospitals are failing and 300 are dying a day
i believe you should
lubs
thought you wouldn't move for another few years
we now have 9k corona cases in america
but i'll miss you flubs
thats how it be sometiems
the number has been rising hour by hour
gummy you being mad at something isnt anything new
oh my
get demon lord to do one
cause it's gummy's mind
you should watch that funny vid
here
this is blessed
my pleasure
okay so switch is coming either tomorrow or monday
also i take it with the no replies from earlier
everyone is happy about this server and there are no complaints?
gummy is everywhere
i mean yes
yes but actually no
aww, my school is starting to offer optional classes starting monday the 23rd for students who need to talk to someone
okay i can feel the tension in the store im at
i thought steam left it bleeding in the moonlight
they're actually doubling down on physical goods like headsets and stuff
shut up skarm
oh thats a fair move
by 2025 they'll probably change their company name to funko-pop stop
bestest buy
gums wants to stream but he can't
or alternatively, bestbest buy
bbesestt buy
btestesb buy
well, from what i know, some numbers in the entries can be imaginary, or variables
and calculus tells imaginary numbers to take a hike most of the time and sticks to being operable in r^n
that's not a cad lady
why does sis get all those fancy looking clothes
mine looks basic
not the same one as the kitty
..whats my password again?
how would i know
i am supposed to for a quest
yay i did another quest
i should prob do summerford now
not that far
are you following me?
i was reading an email okay
close enough
but no my current class is goldsmoth
despite the npc and quest telling you to do so
i thought i did?
you should just be able to right click on the aetheryte
upper section
did you get an error message saying you were currently wearing the best equipment?
it says gears for an arcanist equipped
ignore all the crap i have in mine, that's just how it looks
check your inventory with i
i'm making some stuff for you
if i wasn't around i'd have recommended going back to the city and checking the shops there
~~but you are so i'll just have you do everything for me instead~~
i've finished the body and legs
armour for gummy belle
wait karna?, idk what that is
fate
it's like someone cut karna in half and stuck rarity's head on
wooo
am i too low level?
no it's the fact that you're on a trial character
right click on me and choose ride pillion
wait am
to get teleport thing here?
i have no idea
it's because you need two to learn it
this guy
where?
i know
so i went somewhere
do i still take it?
well if you don't already have the same one, yes
i teleported sis
why did you teleport sis
yay i teleported
now time to put on all the stuff you got
oh my
omg im so cuteeee but not a fan of the shoes
gummy belle pose
oh okay
which is basically me
what the crap there are two of them now?
flubs
so nightshade are you like
or something?
also my mom had to bring up stormy‚Äôs death during this virus crisis
that's
really fucked up
70% of bronycon info was hidden from them and even if there were no deaths, it would have still been hidden
anyways
gummy do you need a hug
no thanks
i hope my workplace closes
are there other things you can do?
i‚Äôll have my shitty laptop
but even if i have switch
i wanted to stream animal crossing
if not...then i won‚Äôt stream the first few days
i need to talk to someone about something stupid everyday
who else do we know...
it is
it's ok flubs, i can only get away with it because no one knows the depth of my depression. mwuhahahaha
actually, everywhere is a good place for an evil laugh
especially if it comes from a cat
but see we killed all the big ones already and we kept the little ones as pets to minimze the threat while keeping the weak as a token of conquest
ok i know
i accidentally punched my cat in the face
watch your back
i said dont trust them not hurt them
i have failed as an animal person üíî
i have 6 other people in this house
i hope my store shuts down
i can make it all ritual-like
i decides to stop at walmart to look at toys
hey transformers are my life
gmt +- anything?
i should have realized sooner since it clearly said made in china on the back
completely forget which
ah ok, makes sense
well it's happening again, maybe, but with his foot
why are you punching cats
it was an accident she jumped onto my desk as i was reaching for my controller t.t
also the second nightshade appears the lurkers come out
wait i'm sorry
flubs is a lurker as well
or was plotting my death
awww
she is trying to trick you into thinking you are forgiven then she will wait until u sleep
well you see i pinged animal man to provide nightshade with a course of righting her wrongs
you know what i mean?
do you think i pay attention in what‚Äôs going on in my servers?
yeah because then i wouldn't be able to make this place a piplup propaganda server
cause sis owns it flubs
oh boy
id be a fair and honest dictator who ruled purely through terror
discord servers that work tend to be dictatorships. certain communities can get away with being autonomous collectives
oh you corrected it
unless sis says no
gummy i know literally every fact
also what did i miss?
and don‚Äôt tell me to re read msgs
...what?
so true?
you sound annoyed
i mean i have it, im not very clear
only when you speak, buddy
flubs
flubs
anyways
flubs wanna stop by for a quick animal crossing stream?
sorry flubs
like i said animal crossing doesn't have a lot of things to do at this point
since i done most of the thigns
who?
im more impressed that there is a hashtag thanking him lol
im scared
i just saw the clip of trump lashing out at that reporter good lord he's an asshole
greater than or less then in complex numbers aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
but i guess my brain wasn't clever enough to come up with challenges or something, because not much happened and we just sorta sat there in front of the projector for a while
sounds like an american thing and not a canadian thing
i haven't seen news of people calling up gun stores
and maybe a gun myself
i don't think you having a gun is a good idea
that was beto o rourke's downfall
you know your country is an abject failure when a stance like "let's not give out ar-15s to literally anybody, maybe" is political suicide
conservatives: you dare violate mah rights fella
better yet can the uk just take us back to their country
we sold about $30,000 in bullets today
im at high risk tomorrow
too much red
6am = best time
yeah but minus four hours
i have exactly 1 other morning bird in my life üíî
rip nightshade
meee...monday when i get my switch
we do have midges, though
tiny flies that go around in clouds
i think theyre like gnats
anyways last day of work
gummy are you on quarantine or something after today?
closing after today
i been hearing the same thing happen in california
but can you over a ukrainian accent?
i laughed so hard
usually im not around fixes that
but not today
i won‚Äôt be able to stream this week
stream tonight and stream tomorrow on switch hopefully
are you going to be on not-up-for-streaming internet until after corona passes?
no drago, the issue is my parents want me back at my hometown and not the city
the internet at my home town is 5 down, 0.82 up
but yeah something like that
"hello everyone, i'm here to substitute stream for gummy. now, the situation calls for me to use thunderbolt on this gyarados, but i need to stay in-character so we'll have gummy using surf on it instead"
spoiler: yes
wow thats a lot higher than i expected
welcome
