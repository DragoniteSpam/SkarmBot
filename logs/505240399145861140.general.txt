welp she left
what does that mean skarm?
the sun never sets on it
i dont think she knows what a drago is though she just calls me bad boy and shakes her finger at me
lets get it
welcome back
we've already had 2 since you left lol
i wish i wasn't working all the time so i could hang out with you guys more often
sounds like a real hoot
wow gummy there's drama in your server and i didnt even get to start it
no quotes in that file!
did i forget to save the autoreconnect thing
ashbot is proto-skarm
since ash belongs to camelot
im not giving you money
he invokes his right to remain silent
some of your people are not cut from the finest wood
im pretty sure i have logs somewhere though
im pretty sure i only saved general anyway
fuck everythiing
so that might be good
this is my hiding place
don't let me down <:bingc:508016918809280532>
will do
i don't know you either!
wtf drago
but they were in the original camelot
what do you even want
it's drago's ghost
no dinner for you ash
communism hmmm
you rang
right i forgot to check that box
master told me he ban him
wow..
how many roles can you attach to a user before discord starts to complain
i dont feel like making any more
okay master strangely msg me calling me a communist
nice
i replied with this
what's up ^w^
unless youre in grad school
are you in grad school
what about them
nothing lol
all the random roles lol
not really lol
three weeks ago i planned out my entire youtube channel schedule through 2024
also
gummy, you and demonlord's opinion on the history behind wwii really helped
oh yeah
welcome
now that is an issue
now germany in 30s was interesting
i ran around my living room with war music and this gun
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
im viking/irish
if rc were to be here, how much of a chance would he make you his rival?
okay that leaves rainy
have you ever seen deci in a place where he couldnt just swing the banhammer? he hates it
you have mods quitting on a daily basis
like the supermarket runs out of juice or something
by definition the people who do the most talking are the majority
i know
i thought he might be mature
helps me improve the server
hee hee butt
okay hmm
i wanna see if anyone else feels the same way
no thanks
oh wait
that was boring, as mean as it sounds
she would say the same thing
im asking her
hey not everyone there sucks
i see people talk about this artiks person a lot but i have no idea who that is
i looked at chat and saw yanis and meant to say exilon
everyone is cool now...
and a troll but a good person
sounds like a plan dragon man
so basically
make way for my sis!
gummy you have too many sisters
maybe every time someone says an arbitrary word like "epidermis" we could pretend to get all offended
and regal and ida
i built that server from the ground up
you know sometimes i think about where it all went wrong gummy
camelot had chuck buuilt
i sent him my video now that i finally posted it and he didnt say a word about the fails
get him to star in it
wait no its that dude
aint that a pocket monster
last time you didn't even wanna collab with me
ash meet flubs and regal
there are givers and takers but i am neither
i create nothing
this is a true friends server
im gonna be honest i dont like league lol
who else?
having no computer is one of the worst things for me lol
yeah that sucks, hope you can recover them
interesting
well you're not missing much
he's one of gummy's old friends
not like i care
just a quiet league stream
do you want me to do it? lol
thanks
hows that?
ok, what role do you want
guys what should i draw? any suggestions? lol
thanks
p!join
*cant* 😦
p!play bokura
p!play wake up, get up, get out there
p!play whims of fate
of all the states why ohio
not the song i was going for rip lol
p!play live and learn
i bought sis a plane ticket to switzerland
come on man show some respect
if he doesn’t and talks agaib
im giving him a chance
i think ida said he's chilled out a bit since two years ago
see you should have changed it to something more descriptive like "i have no friends so i try to attract attention by being inappropriate for no reason"
and drago let my staff handle him
open it up
the one below the graphics card
indeed theyre quite pretty
what?
if the other metal thing doesnt fit i guess
1*low profile pcie bracket (for smaller pcs)
i will sis
yeah
walmartica
some zeal guy finally after like two years
discord deleted their account?
are you sure you aren't him?
that sounds dreadful in every sense of thw word
keb-edge
sis would be jan 5th 2017
demon lord yours is harder to pin point
all i remember was he told me not to date
now jello
also flubs doesn't believe in the moon so his opinion doesn't count
i'm telling aqua you said xenoblade is confusing
oh...yeah that could do as well
i might actually fail
i old new york is coming back
also i mean no matter what i say, at the end of the day theyll accept the fact that my granddad said they shouldnt makes it final
i only take 0.5x fire though
spiffing(?)
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
how the fuck do i load this thing?
this needs to be played in the background
you forgot the part where you put your boxers on your head and sing the alphabet song
alright new plan
the fact that youre not playing skyrim for one
oh tb?
message him
and tell him that he's not going to get the help he needs by waltzing in and introducing himself by saying "i'm lonely"
no got a babysitter for him
he was complaining over not having a gf
someone posted a pic of a nude women with a horse dick in every channel
fuckin drago
wait we already have a troll here
theres like some weird love thing happening and its horrifying
i saw it but it was weird
my server will allow non bronies but if you post a meme shooting people
how did you see so fast?
im being like harassed in university
the service there is crap
just not sure if i should still allow invites for everyone or not
"bite the powder, ram minie ball in, put on cap"
gummy you havent been on thw i ternet for very long have you
i think he would be too scared
oh my
nah i can train him to be tough
wouldn't he bark then?
lmao
eoghan says he wasnt drunk but i'm pretty sure he was
probably
now open the product?
i think that was the only zeal raid to ever happened
hes the nicest person in my family
most normal armies are armed with, you know, actual arms
"you think my handwriting is bad? well tell that to my raptor's face."
yes youd know it was him because that sentence confused me a lot
i had sidebox/sidebars
she would continue barking
flubs is weird
fun fact the girl i asked out in high school is in that one for like 1/800,000th of a blurry frame
damn it
there we go
you better not!
i'd probalby root for her
yeah im the best at dancin
he looks like you
"so do you have any special skills?"
that's enough of that i think
sis im dying
my spare keyboard lights up
xenoblade is weird
yeah kuudere sounds like part of me
i only see the gold one in the members list
flubs!
i may be a bit tsundere
okay sis
something must have broke
it was seasoned with red seasoning salt
i'll make sure it finds a worthy home
is this the one that you paid like seventy dollars for
now stare at this
is she a cute single yellow dragon?
tell her to see a doctor
ahhh
hey sometimes tbh..i do wanna look cute
would it surprise you guys if i told you i had a waifu?
unless you have a dirty mind and want it to mean something
gummy i'm revoking your permission to fantasize now
these days we rarely fight
wtf did this man do to get suspended...
my guts hate my guts
how should i know
because youtube ban has already been done by me, twitter by rc, so facebook is next
but eh
i like the trolls that are really witty about it or the ones that are beyond lazy as shit. the ones in the middle are the shitty ones
i should get my actual sister to join this server
well grandpa died which i dont really care about but made the rest of the family all pissy
tell me all about it
well since hes dead uncle george is now the oldest male in the family so he makes all the decisions and hes a dick
they actually didnt even ask
you make bad decisions but not stupid one
new york flubses only
thats mike 1/5
uncle mike, whos only like 10 months younger
okay i think for once an emulator is a good idea for this
in anything really xd
but would be fun to play
oblivion
most modern trends are pretty shit so that's probably for the best
flubs
that's like 65 at best
make each episode 10 mins long
i wish
the dating guy went crazy, did i tell you that?
or jello
no master did
good idea flubs
but anything can trigger him back
i mean i kinda help him get a girl only for the girl to go out with him for pity
vaguely
okay flubs bring it on!
for dixie land!!!
what did you _think_ was going to happen gummy
im driving this guy to kill himself
master can i link your google doc homework thing or should i find something else
global warming yes
lets make the world like equestria!!!
i haven't always kept up with trends
there are elections coming up in canada and i do wanna vote for the communist party
those sexy ass dolphins are going to destroy us all
im not sure if you understand the history of communism and why it didn't work the first dozen times
and 32 hour work week
caesar got so much power that he became dictator
and takes all the power
guess whos a doctor now, bitches
imma go cut open someones brain and see what comes out
flubs i'm appointing you as sir ultra major badass marshall admiral viceroy grand duke chancellor king princess pope president prime minister c.e.o. buddha god governer shogun tzar cesar c.m.o führer, ph. d.
update: there was more brain inside
drago you coming too
it hasnt for a while
show me
that type of intro you could make
....okay
i'm 80% sure i was trying to delete something else and accidentally checked off some things i didn't intend because i looked up one day and half the series was gone and decided welp there's no point in keeping the rest of it around i guess
then he deleted most of them
the supergummying era timeline is weird 2013-2016?? but the official official would be 2013-2019
but he was young
this was my enemy
oh my
and im like shit
damn
thank god you are here
not that i'm complaining, mind you
right skarm
is that good or bad
tbh it's actually a bit sad that people in the future won't be able to walk into a game store
animal crossing might be my fav game
gummy you should go post spam in my comments it'd boost my seo probably
same
just low internet speed problems
it doesnt exist
but my internet speed's staying where it is
must be stuck in the spam folder
yeah
you upload more than eyan these days
omg flubs
it was better editing than me
why do you of all people haev to be a dragon
that explains why you and i get along well
it looks the same
flubs that was amazing video
i added snow
twenty dollars an hour
but since we're friends i'll only charge you $19.50
oh so he worked correctly before but silently did nothing that time
no some offer it for free for one time use
your parents might kill you
oh you know im dead right?
but always remember the pat pat method
man somedays i need a break from the server
go ahead
but yeah a brony server is hard to run
im surprised flubs
you did great though
if you dont youll get burnt out and start to resent it
thats what makes them special
there site is gone
katsukity said something about trying to return with a new site
it'll be an assfire for everyone else
what video
i mean errr
no one heard me
gummy stop hitting on strangers
man some uni students are so cute
you can
wanna check that gum?
so is the 2ds just like the newest version of the ds? because it looks like a normal ds
it is
flubs wanna replace bella/someone who is no longer present?
canada talk, university. i am attracted to a woman
non that's mostly kugal
iceland school work work school iceland. sheep something i think. gummy is a mess and i must fix him
well making any progress is an accomplishment
stupid though....thats a different story
gummy i don't love you
isnt that a kind of pig
hmm it's two in the morning i should think about sleep
and im surprised no one also realized it
guys shouldn't be allowed to play
also apparently the piano is a woman's instrument
how was math?
i found out my gf lives in the same city pewdiepie lives in
so you can meet the most famous youtuber and do a collab with him
yeah
any costs
wait till they find out im dating a trans woman
wtf?
i dont think those would
in general though total war beats animal crossing by a tiny bit
and your fave game is skyrim
nah my favorite game overall is dishonored
close but actually it would be mario galaxy
my favorite game uh
close enough
you should have
okay i would play that tbh
she knows my bday
fairly sure flubs actually got it right
what's the age limit on dream daddy
i'm not interested in the details thanks
what is it?
welp
this is my hero
yea you're right
well if it's a day late then it won't miss it
his name is anthony?
there are a lot of people named anthony
something about her heading on the route to eterna forest where the screen turned black while she can hear audio only and then it went black and had weird text then took her to the ds screen
caught you, you motherfucker
read the tex
i sent my sister jackson parodi's accordion metal and now i'm trying to get her to play accordion metal and she's complaiining that she doesn't have an accordion
flubs we are watching this when it comes out
ooo i should look at yours and ida's old post on forums
so apparently there's a couple of new switch models in the works
see what young drago has to say
it was mostly in the chatbox
ida is always angry at me
remember the patreon thing
(kendall is my new new sister)
take mine
3 non blood
like weed cake?
be nice to toad dude
i would love to read what they said
i don't have early interactions with drago either
i still have skype logs on the old granny laptop but i dont feel like turning it on and searching for them
therefore you do something
no u
hey i sold those sharks for a total; of 45,000 bells
how rude!
only if you do my homework for me
wanna go drinking with me when i turn 19?
maybe i don't actually
do vikings drink?
make way for vortex!
epic
woah that was forever ago holy shit
and you do it more than eyan lol
was pimaster older or younger?
i think i'm the 2nd oldest here
wtf drago
oh ash bot is kinda here vortex
again
lets invite someone even older
noooo
yes!!
was that ida
thats a sis thing
have a pony instead
no thank you
wooooooooo
might as well drop this here while i'm here
and by a lot i mean 2 uploads lmao
since i feel like copyright on twitch is a bit better
also i just prefer twitch in general
if only i can stream better
stupid internet
drago your house is on fire
toasty
good because i'm cutting your salary mister
theres almost twelve thousand of them, have ufn wiwth that
flubs tell him he did!
soo can't
now it qualifies as a work of art
exactly
with a friend 🤔
i've heard fire emblem awakening is good, that's the only game i'd like to get at this point
i enjoyed that quite a bit
hmmm surprised you didn't say smash
might find that in stores
yeah but i will be sad when 3ds is gone
do any of the 2dses use the clamshell design
cute
well im pretty sure spots on my arm are contagious
(╯°д°）╯︵ /(.□ .\\)
sis gets my pc
the fireball fizzles out in your fingers, but the dragon's face is suddenly covered in dish-shaped scars
and they suddenly sprout fangs for no apparent reason
sure
can i cast anymore?
2334 caster's spellbook giggles in the presence of other books
to teleport? sure
cast a spell on you to make you do my assignment for me
and make my twitter look good
why do you even want a banner when youre trying to get banned
he died
one of my fav youtubers is returning
mostly look at kay...ida because i know that will ping her and drago
didn't get pinged but saw this anyways
“gummy what have you been thinking of?”
actually flub you also seem proud of your past
fried or roast?
well the man was depressed
i mean he always seemed like a decent guy in chat
flubs
heres both
thanks
what did she end up picking?
okay he found out a few hours ago thank goodness
good job
blade lord nayru
superspamming
thats redundant kugal
thats oxymoronic
there we go
as you can see
i'll pay _you_ $50 for it then
no? too bad here's the joke: my life
all pranks are good as long as they arent just "haha i lied to you"
true
the best gift you can give is your presence
eh i would get you one of those cooking aprons
aprons are for nerds, cool kids dont care if they get burning hot food on them
think of something
i only know all the lore and have watched and read the whole thing multiple times
gummy did
i'm sure our number of customers today was in the quadruple digits
lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
back hom
im hiding in her closet
this was what i used before i got ban
i know i didn't make it
ohh kingcorphish made it
i personally didn't know the dude, but the main person that exposed him is a girl i been following for many years
now evidence has been put out and corphish has been hurt i know that for sure
that is floaty lady
<:pikasanta:516171795196542986>
he knew about one of the pedo
i haven't really watched his stuff but i know he gets along well with other let's players
you really aren't part of the pokemon community
otherwise you would be talking to corphish
hit him!
back in the old days ida annoyed drago
well back in the old days it was unintentional
i see
how was that?
yes!
also tell them that people who are different than them are still people
do you know anyone from the south i want to try that it sounds exciting
i do, theyre related but are not dating
bunni
gummy tell bunni that a pirate ship was born on jesus and tell me what she says
that gets truer by the day sadly
what you upgrade to?
millions
i might make quiz later
how does flubs know my pizza toppings well?
got 7/10 on dragos
tbh i know nothing about mlp
i just picked random ones so
you want to pet a rabbit
wait you actually have a gun?
i got all the math ones wrong because of course
it was an accident
pull it down real hard and get it aligned under it
and how did you get mlp and equestria girls wrong?
the night is young
kill me
wait let me check
samsung galaxy
anyways good night
yeah
anyways counting everyone
except for jeff
i'm having fun at your expense
they weren't in the original camelot though
yeet
i like deci when he's not being a knob at someone
errr
xeon
you or me
me because my tolerance for others is far lower than yours
tbh stormy tolerates me
that drama scarred everyone
no they don't have permission
so flubs
so far patching things up has been going super well
twice
`e!re` has been axed and it's staying axed
damn it
time to make lillie bot work
god damn it
gummy stop hitting on fictional characters
e!kenobi
any movie can
how about
you ever seen dora's tits my dude
fbi we have you completely surrounded
flubs you are under arrest 
come out with your hands in the air
but pls pls tell me you know my favourite movie
sis i swear to god
thats my second
i think you meant to delete it or something
fucking hell
fucking micheal bay
which i didnt include
i would not have guessed that
remember?
that'll be expensive but the main expensive thing will be getting an interface
for me it isnt april yet so i cant make a joke
oh so thats why you like drums
what has zeal done?
camelot i decided to go easy
dammit got 4
did i do your quiz yet?
i see
home at a totally normal hour
my waifu with...aj!!!
is that a saying?
nice
put the bullet in the open end, press the button, it goes out the other end
are they renting the place or do they own it
thats fair
when you find out someone isn't someone you thought they were
whole bunch of weirdos
actually i know she prob would be more shy irl
what's forums
im happy mlp spoilers got super active
also there are no rules here
honestly we are all mature enough to talk about politics and not post nsfw
this one is blessed
thats fair sis
the idea of splitting people into left and right sucks
the guy with the birds
yeah sis
gummy i'll vote for you purely on the grounds of putting "and stuff" in your campaign slogan
death penalty i have different opinions on
iceland has the best equal rights
don't know how i've kept my sanity
but my mom and i talk about it every day
its socialism when its helping people not starve but its capitalism when its a mutli-billion bailout to a company from the govt
when there is no food allowed in there
no drago
gummy keep your pants on
no no keep them off
but the studios that made shriek
she really fuck a bee
she does not fuck the bee no thats just my head canon
flubs
thats true, but usa does have better stuff
alright
most of the time
alright sis is twilight, no argument about it, loves reading, strong leadership, prob could fly, and knows magic
flubs you are...hmmm
okay lets compare bella and ida to a sibling way since bella did tell me i was like a brother
witness shoplifting while you are there
then leave and necro walks in
see how stupid i was
cause i remember bella being on both at the same time
flubs i apologized for wanting you to burn
lets quiz you
eat the wings!!!
see when people see dragon runes on my back they just assume there's already something wrong with me
i tried to self promote
but errr
i don't think the name is the issue here
why does she have like 7 axes in here
i cleaned it up for her
to paris!
also the i was reading messages in your server from earlier and the way tenda just shut that person down is goddamn hilarious
flubs hates france
who was that person?
theres a lot of people who go there for tourism and trash the streets, but off of the main tourist areas its real nice
people suck
maybe
i decided to get a logo for my gummy jacket
alright
flubs you missed a raid
my server of course
im the server troll here
he does sometimes get a little accidentally rude when talking with one of his buds thats a furry but thats because hes stupid
you know climate change
deal
this is good
nevada
okay that ain't far
he likes pizza
sounds good
i use class for reddit
sometimes being an owner sucks
noooo
car looks bad tho
drove into a traffic sign
panicking is natural, your in a machine that can hurt someone or yourself, but the important thing is deep breaths
that's why i don't drive
less cars and you aren't as pressure
btw go ahead and make anything you want on this server
our highways barely had anyone
left is this way < right?
flubs
the sun never sets in gummyland
wanna see?
im always tired
are you still going to be a history teacher?
2071.1
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
yeah you got that big ol fish recently right
lets watch drago's videos
im rioting
i love the cold but its still not canada
well "work"
i have to find the electrical power needs of chicago
yes!!
what is it?
so yesterday i discovered the names of the player characters in pokémon sun and moon
i had thought they were just called sun and moon lol
the black hole is very cool
it's cute i guess
i mean its a hole. its black. what did people expect
are you calling my mom skinny
[4:27 pm] dragonite: it's fun when science people try to make numbers understandable to noobs```
wow thats like 8 zeroes
it's a sextillion meters which is hilarious in modern english
the spear wielder rarity is dressed like
how did it taste
just because im on social media and pretend to listen doesn’t mean i can’t get the job done
drago
i know she would win
so apparently there's gonna be another trg colosseum soon
aw shit
you taught him that trick
does that one even know what sex is? because its real hard  to do it through discord
i mean if you think about it life is an std, you put the thing in the thing and then the lady has a foreign body sucking the nutrients out of her blood for 9 months
the fat kid
i guess?
god i hate him even more
he finds out in the middle of the episode he isn't moving but doesn't tell his friends until the end
he takes the pokemon and was like "oh yeah guys im not moving" and giggles
sure why not
but that only ended up confusing eyan lol
people have a hard time understanding big numbers, they should just take the base-ten log of the vote total to make things easy for the noobs
cause if every vote is placed in the hat 3rd parties would have a greater chance with the hat than the current election system
but then having the vp actually do something is an intersting twist
or ancient city
define those
wait no im 20 not 2
he makes funny joke right?
you remind me of the scot trainer
only angrier
hey im edgy but i dont call him a libtard yet
if that's the case then you're both edgy
hi edgy
there is no opinion or emotion in that statement
actually maybe
we already memed the shit out of how they can repair the timeline
also witcher is like 40 gigabytes so good luck me
actually don't answer that
never met a maltan.... maltese..... person from malta
my turn to teach her how to drive
why is it that my favourite sibling is also the only sibling besides my real sister that is embarrassed at most of my stupid activities?
exactly
i mean what
i dunno you should ask her
huh?
adopt me ida
thats what i meant
holy shit
hey im almost legal to drink
2 more months
yeah but i dont need to worry about my health
drinking ain’t always bad if you do it casually though unlike drugs
still not good for your liver and shit though. but yeah a glass of wine with dinner is much better than a gram of coke with dinner
helppp
sooo she is officially officially sibling material as well
wait what
any day
kids
it sucks and i hate it
idk how to even code this
gummy im getting bored of editing xenoblade, should i take a break and edit the thing im lets playing after that instead?>
wtf is this
still don't care for twitch tbh
my eyes
but still, link should always remain a silent protagonist
high heels are sports shoes you ever wear those shits?
idk man im bad with money
shit should be an olympic sport
i don’t wanna get fired though
and more candy
i worked at a grocery store who lffered competitive wages and flexible hours and it was like "yeah, competitive and flexible for them"
i already staked a claim to his pizza
don't waste food
i had a&w last night
had a foodgasm
micky d's doesnt take as long either but it's also not freshly made like a&w
in and out is trash
never heard of them
dq, imo, is again, pretty ok
i wanna try it
how bad is it?
they put 150% more tomato sauce than what is recommended
prob not
this is where gummy looks up my school on google maps
i havent had them since like second grade
prob best drink for you anyways
i happen to live in the only state where gambling is legal
besides i spend more money in walmart on transformers toys then casinos
but it's g1
i dumped another 20 gb on nier automata recording today
random tunes ftw lol
probably less than 8 tb
this looks cool
but how else will you keep your butt smooth
or else no mor free pizza
putting food in the microwave at 12:26 am wont wake everybody up, right
you did it first
blame my sis for not sharing with you
in reality i love being called a nerd, i live to be called a nerd
we wouldn't have technology if it weren't for them
imma viking now
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaa
that sounds like work
three is easy, it's just floor(tau*0.5)
you should mention how awesome your dog is
what in the name of flubs is shazam
i rounded up
i do on most weekdays
you knew her for years
because tomorrow most places are close
how i know this...well i did read the bible twice
what food?
demon lord can you ask him why god gave us catholics if he loves us so much for me
most priests are usually pretty cool people. course the other ones are...not good to be around
its fucking bonkers
drum covers
my apartment to acquire food units
i thought agaravin was a guy....
wtf is this?
that's
also fate/ gareth was a girl
i only picked those 4 because wiki says they were related to mordred
oh i know gareth is a girl
look at likes
fairly sure agravain's a half brother on mother's side
i have a strong dislike for fire emblem these days
and no reply
my two fav sis are also pretty easy forgiving
pepperoni
okay i'll eat it
....so that's what the app is called?
wooo got a reply!!!
yeah
i find the fact that ida keeps getting asked about it funnier than the fact that the app actually exists
it's one of those icelandic people things i guess
i also constantly get people replying with "cool" when i tell them i'm icelandic
it's on fire remember
rapidash would burn you
there's an english one now
i havent played pokémon since i kick gummy's exfriend's butt with a shuckle last summer
well it's fairly predictable tho
ida did you even see the shuckle battle, my strategy was to just sit there and do nothing until she got mad and did something dumb
not even heroin?
i havent done cocaine i think
you are legal
fuck
weakness policy multiscale is the most broken thing ever and it feels like cheating every time i use it
yeah but half the fun of drinking is im not supposed to. now that i can i just feel like my mom or something
why did you check?
oh so thats why its been so colorful lately
most of the new episodes we talk about are in mlp spoilers
if you right click on a server
i guess we have a more colourful personality?
i thought for sure flubs was trying to beat my record back in zeal
i wouldnt be surprised
more than gummyland or less?
flubs is going upstate to yell at his relatives because apparently im not done with this shit yet
holy fuck why is the house so far north
wait who is taking you?
a friend is going to buffalo to visit family and theyre taking me. the timing is good so im using the weekend to fuck over their easter too
but if you show up now
you can't fuck it up
so that's something lol
id rather not exercise the privilege for a while but what can you do
"fine, whatever, just go away"
math and english and the writing i tried my best but reading and science were like 'fuck it'
i dont remember ever watching a singe episode of that show

well cross the street
old people

we had a target in town but now we dont
they replaced target with lowe's where i live
i went to a lowes once
dirt bike racing
sure why not
bucky got the short end of the stick though
why?
oh i was wrong, endgame isnt the end of phase 3. the next spiderman is now a part of phase 3. so black widow is probably the first of act 4
im anticipating getting fucked hard for it
we didnt eat a bite
says here pork should not be eaten pink
eh if i do then whatever
hmmm
that always fixes something
i swear im not racist
do you like white chocolate then?
hmmmm

maybe you can do it again for extra credit
i will ban him
i “hired” for free a person to make a website for my server wooo
that being said
two years ago
i actually wanted to rework that
yeah i knew that
i would but my mom dragged me to walmart
and asked for sex there
dont get me wrong, the server is still fuckin *weird* but not because of that
oh god someone get kugal the anatomically correct doll
to each their own
my sister is in this server
tb's ex who i hate has offered to make me a website
what you mean to tell me is this lad got one girl, and then got a second
well kendall likes you, and she also wants to talk to ida but at the same time jokingly jealous of her
i have trouble remembering which brony is which
not my fault they are like my sis
also a transgender
i know
i just feel guilty for banning a depressed person
and read young drago tweets
agreed
exactly
this was what he said to me a month agp
what kind of play would you have said yes to?
harmful to himself
can we go to italy?
things sure have changed
nooo
if you don’t die
we need to protect flubs
gummy guess what
oh and fries too

yeah they seem chill
im thinking about trying to apply
now im only making these things off games i have done before
gummy we are no longer friends
yes he is
i still have my yahoo email, its kinda crap but it was my first email and i still have important accounts built using it as an email
not like i have assignments to do or anything
look it's not like i told him to do it
ready for this?
kugals last name is nerd

vivaldiblitz
drago you suck
i feel uncomfortable when you are bein so nice
maybe he meant phat
shut up
blitz is fat

because thats how much i like having you around
hi always hungry im flubs
i know right *dab*
it all goes to direct relief
thats for my collection!
only i'm allowed to kill my sister
i wouldn't even try smoking tho
wait why do when i search "mordred" in gifs there are a lot of animations of her without many clothes
wow drago is right
even though yanis has the sexiest accent
now that is a nice pick
eh, not really
venice is garbage right
he is safe
he likes pokemon drago
alright then
you should already be bowing yes
yes, my commandment is that all subjects shall be made to read danganronpa
he probably washed his face
i give my dog less than a fist sized bit of food every day and he finishes it like 1/2 the time
i second that
no she was already a weirdo
but i threw it on the ground
then broke one kinda
gummy i got 100 on todays history test are you proud of me
and it ended off with obama's presidency
alright i think thats all im gonna say on that to not stir shit
classes get really passionate and those only have like 40 - 80 people as it is
we got to go home from school after just an hour
that's about when we went home
we were not there for a terribly long time
jesus
it was fun
good drago
yea wtf china
i think the materials for my calc iii class are free 😮
.0000000375 usd
gummy i dont know if those are safe to have in your house
funny you mention that
okay if the file ever opens
all right anyway
who's masae
you're just useless
wait i can just pin both
fuck you
though im the favourite
didn't even know until 30 seconds ago
so basically, it's probably going to come out around holiday2022?
alright drago
give me meat
what the crap is lood
it means lewd
i no longer have a keyboard addiction
this was a used one for $62?
what mechanical switch do you have?
did i ask a question?
on no
you mean like the big things on the power lines?
calculate the impedance of an lrc circuit
kugal stop being young
what the hell gummy
well
the american education system sucks
you fell on the floor right?
imma teach you then sis
mine was 700, dropped another 80 on ram and another 80 on two more hard drives because you can never have enough hard drives
i got see the pikachu movie
its 8 notes long and loops infinitely
did you listen to the song i said sounds like benny?
or is he the one that founded the usa
movie was sold out
*noms ribs* i like ribs
yummy
i guess most of them were like drago you are a banana or whatever
so like
why not put it in a kids show?
i think kids tend to know about sexuality/feelings a lot earlier than people seem to realized
😮 cupcakes!!!
true
i love gossiping
ohhh mb
hes the worstest
looks good actually
bad pic but you get the point
i only share cupckaes with cool people
i made a pony
then made it in human form
it would also be funny to have ida there babysitting us but that might be logistically more of a challenge
i may dwell on here.
jared did a bad
she was his ex wide
i dunno if he'd like traveling
made a <#578002937544966145> channel
going to have to remember that exists
thats absurdly funny gummy
imagine being that full of confidence
no please go on im almost there
i recommend shitting
should i troll them?
he yells a lot
baby charlie!
she died
<:fluttercry:570771095033085952>
<:kurisusip:561042019112321034>
hey im better
here
anything i can help with?
it's been a rough few years for me
i know i haven't always shown that on here but yeah
thanks
people currently active in zeal send their regards
pizza
there's only one.
it's my favorite from all 2d scroller ones.
it does in a way.
because it's very old and was used for several thousands of hours
nice.
i see.
maybe a few
only we two.
why aren’t you in gummyland today?
no about graduating
she refuses to watch with me
i tried
never
they post clop. it's disgusting.
guys
nah sounds entertaining
mjhvbjjkh
i think i have an extra one in the shed if you want it
thats impressive
92% on criminology final and holy bollocks i got 11% on my calc 2 final
at driver
i feel so lied to
(ida you didn’t have to point put the obvious)
it cost me $120 just to take the exam
120 fucking dollars
such bullshit
she too nice to me now 😣
sis*
on duty
for some reason the idea of gummy being a shepherd is way funnier than the idea of ida being a shepherd
whichever
you wouldn't be entirely wrong gummy
one would say enough to drive you insane
gummy
plus i am clumsy and will end up hurting myself in a way
and also they were probably used to humans because they were owned by an old guy who was like "two euros and you can give them food and pet them for as long as you like"
i'm all for normalizing it, but i don't personally think it needs to be in shows for young kids
hey maybe you can herd her bunny instead
i would do it
if you can come up with a more creative name
i didn't know
flubs name is steven
sis's name is charlotte
and also i sort of imagine he spent a lot of time smoking weed
nope the opposite actually
im trying to download this platinum emulator
brb shower probably
1.37 miles
ha no one calls me by real name
i dont think its going to be march, it's cold in march
running with a backpack on is very taxing
why are you bothering with whatever month is coming up
gummy is merciful.
i dislike math personally.
wish me luck
dude good luck
hell yea
im trying to sleep
i want chipotle right now
even though never seen one
neither did i.
i want arbys
it looks like a butt
you need to try harder
flubs tonight
league of legends
shots fired
kek.
i think for everyones sake i need to not do that
too small
im making myself hungry lmao
eat it
crispy chicken burger
i gotta think of good math emotes then
sure
star
so no xkcd 303?
no even a single star emote.
and thats why minecraft is the best game ever created
i hate that show
ooo gummyland raid
can't remember her actually banning anyone, but ok.
i wish i'd remembered that trick during the recording but oh well
anyone from a raid.
just barely annoying enough to not get a new one
when stuff expires it just gets worse at doing what it does. milk tastes worse, meat makes your body explode from disease, etc
flubs stop hitting on uni students
we're both made of atoms so sure
and thats made of atoms and shit
time to see if its been uploaded to the internet yet
of course they are
i hate game of thrones
sooo when will walking dead end?
wow a lot will end in 2019
and what have you seen so far?
reason why is because he wants to stop cyberbullying....
i think i remember a disproportionate number of people being classic internet condescending pricks to him over something undoubtedly small
boom roasted!
gummy beat him to it so gummy gets the point
i suppose you could return an array or an object containing multiple values if you want
good!
have some more
gotta spice things up
you post a pizza picture then
great
noooo
how big?
so big it costs 1000 dollars
"$1,000 pizza sold at nino’s restaurant in nyc features caviar, lobster"
its fish eggs
sup my dude
now thats something i would do
luckily thatll never happen so we're good
god if my metabolism ever slowed down id be such a fatass
lol why is that even a roll
o k fine
darn
and try not to over work yourself
sleep is proving to be more difficult
and it did nothing
ah, pavlovan conditioning
happened when i was in elementary school too
tbh i should sleep as well soon
thats all i know
drago go sleep
fine lets explore the city instead
sup peeps
hai there gumbotron
what do yall think of this picture of me
dark?
aww thans
yes that is my leg but thats irrelevent
<:wat:579563576914870333>
watch it flubs
ayy 100 on my part 2 final for english
im talking a 45 second, big long yell. i cant even whisper that long
im bored flubs
only slightly less photon-black-hole-ish
flubs created the world
people are so dumb these days
you are wearing shorts*
i call her crazy also though so it's okay
when i wear shorts
i'm sure my mom must think that about me too
so my mom has had plenty of time to get used to it
6 more followers and if i can maintain 3 average views
because i asked my viewers my starter pokemon
some other web sites would let you do that probably
she has work all week and weekend
her fiancee is michael from mandjtv
he apparently said to someone during a stream they should die a horrible death
i could be, for example, a gummy
lmfao
drago you are a gummy worm
but what do you expect from a guy that likes muskets?
the cane is only to be used for the betterment of society
and i dont know why i installed it in the first place
origin is a bad launcher
hmm i need to be in class in like ten minutes
kek.
i got 96 on the physics final woo
seems like my server now has a similar issue with that but instead of an account called the greatest, we have an account called “flippy”
that they might be some server bot thing?
that might have been it
makes flubs a milkshake
good after being sick
that's nice of you.
yea.
thats cute
drago
youtube crackin down on the channels that center around drama prolly lmao
i hate to say this because it's a very interesting system but i feel like socialblade isn't going to last regardless of what youtube does
true
hey drag join freedom yet?
bunni that is not a bunny
i thought the same thing, gum.
hes not that crazy
so that's convenient
well i won't be leaving the resort, that's for sure
and im really not, i just like streaming with my ex a lot
which is why i'm never buying bits or subscribing to anyone
i mean isn't every site money grubbling?
and the culture on the site is so toxic and bleeds into so many other things
is to directly donate???
bits and subs
lets build a city for good purposes
but man these movies are so predictable
but amazon is cool
grossest thing in the internet is dragonite
maybe you dont
and they died because the new person died?
and then she left
also demon lord
no this place isn't composed 30% of people who need to go out and see some sunshine
you could always have put it in the trash can
drago you donate
someone dm me over an issue with someone else
yeah im not gonna risk it
yanis has conflict with you two sometimes
hes my everything etc etc
it gives me a headache
was yanis the one who sorta went into cardiac arrest when told him to stop thinking about things he hates for ten seconds
you never met yanis before drago
and he is french
yeah thats floral to you
that's terrifying
your choice
babies
pay me
wait you're giving me an artist?
have fun with that
top kek.
kiddies
was the most i had
tonight i will stream for 10 secs at midnight
keep up with your strength
he's just in denial
<:shrug:579725441099890689>
you gotta be careful of friction gummy
and flubs how is this place better?
she ain’t lewd
no yo udont
i see...
if you are ever asking if im biased
yay!
all right..
so i can announce my special day?
looooolll
but also good job
availability of stormy
but you should get a schedule. and a job. and friends. and other stuff
yes it does
it sucks and i hate it?
i’ll take that as an eh!
they're free in the us?
wanna help
gummy banner is done
plus i have ublock origin. lol.
for watching ads
flubs what?
the ones you watch for bits
those get around it. so you do still have to watch them
flubs can pick
flubs this is the worse time to sub to me
the worst*
also guys i have to admit something...
you're terrible at everything?
he cut school the day of the big math test
oh yeah hes a liar and a cheat
oh i made fake accounts on my forums
when ida and i had second accounts for the rp thread we'd go into the chatbox and yell at ourselves sometimes
unfortunately the logs from the chatbox dont exist anymore, there were some gems in there
right ida?
fun fact sis not stormy is the person who can calm me down the fastest
better than your banner drago!
becasue it'd ignite instantly
my banner has a reference to everything
s is blue based on rarity's dress colour
no tiberia was me
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115>
kek.
isn't that worst?
yay!
which i need to make ding dongs joke
it's me, a boy
to the server of fun people
ooh canada boys
in _may_
lol yep
demonlord and gummy are in the land of canada
and i only learned about it today
you spelled it right lol
my sleep schedule is jacked too
or however you spell that, i don't keep track of pokémon much these days xd
doing well besides feeling like i should be productive right now
convenience rocks
also there's a direct flight to there from where i live
yeah i've never been on a trip like that before so it should be fun
lol same
last last summer i was *supposed* to travel, by car, to wisconsin but plans got cancelled and im still a travel virgin
well we drove all the way to arkansas so i guess that kinda counts as going to a few states lol
im immortal
welp
flubs is a jock
anyone who dies is dumb
and flubs
or turpentine
fabulous
my sis protects gummy
i have no work!
i dont know code but sure
i tried
im gonna attempts to stay up all night
am i tol or smol
i chased after a girl who was mean to me
drago
how did you even find that
charlie knows how to make life hell for me
wtf today is tuesday?
except he isnt really gentle, if he steps on your foot it fucking hurts
charlie doesnt slobber on me, im an expert of avoiding teh slobber
sure
alright sounds cool
nah he'll just howl at you from 10 feet away
gummy i have my own anti-charlie bible
bye charlie!
how much are they actually
its cheaper to buy a pro controller then 2 joycons
$376 cad
it's a dinosaur
unless the graphics card is way underpowered and the botw people just did some insane black magic to make the game work. they probably did.
or i could make drago mad saying im returning to youtube
my loopy card actually still works it's just the 3ds itself thats on the fritz
he nearly murdered my balls when he threw me a pack of mambas
of course that server becomes pretty active when i'm asleep.
yes.
he's gentle 95% of the time
im worried about this now
shit
mhmm
it's simpler
yes.
i like both but the second one pleases my brain more
well, not symmetrical but you get what i mean
remember the old days of camelot
i was?
it was you, master, and i
i don’t fully remember
lets try to make this the golden age again
dont try to recreate what has passed
thats a good idea
<:dan:579731005317971969>
theres people
i think drago and i need to roast each other more
thats attitude
well there we go
the rules are there are no rules
2 be nice
i want pancakes
ugh i got a busy day tomorrow
i like how we're two days away from june and idaland still has snow
i have a cool mnemonic to remember this kind of thing
if it is your mental state you are responsible for it. if it isn't you aren't
all the mods who well didn’t work or gone
youre not his mom
team up against him
i demand to be invited!
will!
the shapes are bigger and closer
a what now?
i like cookies and milk
the morning hours are an amazing time of introspective awakening
with the native americans
what's that
also this bus smells like piss
yummy
i forget why i got a 3ds xl instead of a 2ds xl
thanks
probably
he already hinted something if you are around his twitter, plus i can tell by the way he acts, he's borderline depressed
yeah i dug around his twitter
rainy and eyan seem to last
rainy and eyan have the most sixth-grader relationship ive ever seen and i love it
and i hate it
a lot
rawr
the one where i got accepted into rpm network when i was a senior in high school and then like a month later youtube was like hey, you dont need an mcn to be partnered anymore
i dont remember so, no
lmao
sort of in the same way that having all of your legs amputated sounds fun
you shed a little bit of weight but on the other hand holy crap you dont have any more legs
someone told me to
because your skill is susceptible to breakage under immense force
thats even worse
i'm not dead :o lol
haven't streamed for a week rip lol
they added a handful of songs
when's my birthday gummy? lol
ive had so many cats
i have 2 currently
*has no life* lol xd
me neither lol
yay!
yeah i think it took almost a week for my first emote but 2 or 3 days for my second one
i'mma be leaving the vc too.
have fun lol ^w^
lol xd
ooh lol
heard worse lol
send link please? lol
they're totally not screenshots and stuff <:bsdderp:584676007664156675>
quote of the day in another server. you'll know when you see it lol
oooo
much better than chrome.
flubs you missed a big vc here yesterday
the one night i go to bed before midnight lol
welp reddit just died for me
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115>
feel free to vote multiple
i was probably asleep then lol
nice lol ^w^
i love how rarely anyone promotes their stuff in this server
she has the personality to keep my stream alive
when this server is made for self promo
here is an example
a danganronpa character
that too
everyone is gay
you're a girl?
hey gummy wanna go out on friday?
it’s a good meme
gummy, you can give me your wii u.
even if you get one for free
wii had even more great games.
oh it also had mario mak - oh wait
which nobody played
because ive been too busy using my wii u as capture scaffolding for wii games
but i also dont feel like spending money
sounds like war music
obligatory
so drago
there
i typed dragonitespam banner
i know
note that it does not have a due date
gummy stop reading my notes
and my sis is on this server
i realized everyone that works for me is an asshole, an idiot, or a bootlicker
i honestly cant tell which of the three is worse
without question
because im amazing
who esle is excited for a new season of black mirror
milk expiring is like the death of a loved one you monster
or you put it on craigslist and ship them a brick with an image of your junk taped on it
all the first male flubses are named mike
well i want gummy relatives
sis nooo!
wanna actually be related to me sis? ~~i can hook you up with one of my french cousins~~
sooo the guy who looks like drago who is depressed showed me his prom pics
and is getting depressed since the girl didn't want more
you know the one in zeal
i mean i did reach out to him back when he was really depressed back in zeal
late bunni?
sure i can wait
i can't stay up too late either
i dont want to deal with myself
yeah but he had memes in the way r/frenworld has memes
yall is plural so it woild be more correct to say yall are weird _gummies_
okay this website building is harder than i thought
for everyone especially bringina to see
bringina has never seen my grumpy side and i hope she never does
only a few times
and like 1/3 of the population speaks english but the other 2/3 yell
no flubs that what gummy and i so
invite the uncle
go to sleep gummy. listen to ida.
well now someone has to use kissing booth then all channels will be used
superyummying.
very minimal amount of fat too
yea i don't either, i like a little because when you cook it it renders down and makes even juicier
what subjects?
all people are garbage
i mean it was kinda obvious but not
here i am still not even close lmao
my server invite is like....
welp need to get on pc first
and i didn't want her to see me angry like this
im considering something stupid
and if you sold mario 3d world with it you could probably get a fair bit
does this server need boosting?
my pc doesnt need specs
but i managed to take 100% of it
no drago
my sister has a wii u game so in order to sell everything
thought you own one
no my cpu isn’t twice
why both we have all the stuff we need
oh you know what maybe you can do this
well this server doesn’t have nitro people besides me and sis
kugal i will pay for your haircut if you do that
good job
im reading 50 shades of drago
either that or 49 pages of me crying and one of me masturbating *while* crying
drago
flubs i thought you never cry
well flubs
the screen protectors do not need a firmware update
oooh, ad astra looks sick af
no i mean no he cant have it
guys
if i got the news then yeah many have
send it here
i don’t want a new one since i will upgrade a lot next year
so that's the part of your brain that got retrofitted as a space to store extra calculus
oh you know what else i do?
those are a l classic six day a week moment kugal
i picture a piano to remember the difference between left and right
one time my mom accidentally put chocolate milk syrup on my waffles when she was on autopilot
see at least thats sugar on sugar
let's go with acid
stress, some other issues, and i was soaking wet leaving my university today because it rained hard
i've been feeling the weirdest mix of guilt from being off of school
like did you tell em your dog ate your hw
pc3-12800 ddr3 1600
drago is about to part with some first edition ddr100 ram and he doesnt even know it
i should do some research
a very weird part of me wants to cut mine short
and yet i'm still probably gonna do it. i'm a fool
get out of here with your proverbs ya nerd
gummy is that you?
speaking of money i just paid a $360 fee to my college for calc 3
oh right
gummy why do you have a petri dish in a pizza box
and the year skyrim came out
but it’s giving me a stomachache
so did zeal server get boosted?
anyone wanna share these cookies and milk with me
did you finally buy one of those sheep from ida or something?
the lady
you don't need to, you already have a cool accent
they're yummy
it may work or it may fry my pc
nice!
probably more like 25, since it's not shiny and new, as if that matters for ram
also i feel like i didnt hear _anybody_ speculating about emile playing chrono trigger until like, three days ago
on twitter they were
and beat drago in yt once again
like, the entirety of it
is that your sister?
some moron destroyed my gummyland poll
and they didnt invite me?
i had it set to check ip
which option did they vote for?
so guys
some of those bosses can be rough
i havent done that since december
well tell him to do them fast because im busy tonight
i'll bundle it with the ram
i've been to the us quite a few times, mostly just minnesota since i'm only 45 minutes away
sis is watching this in the background knowing i lost too many brain cells
even more treason
i like the top one too
kiddies
i thought that was just an urban legend
well shoot
reason being is gummyland is too self center towards me
though then drago took over
alright so this server is basically what i intended gummyland to be back then
that being said, feel free to invite who you want here, rules are strict but no nsfw pics and stuff, you can kinda talk about nsfw stuff depending on what it is but no pics
also no bullying people or swimming
and most but not all do have mod powers here
if server changes name
i have to change everything
guys
i never promote it here so idk how people know
i just ignore them 9 times out of 10 so i miss most streams
my sample size is uh
listen flubs
kugal let'
have you even _seen_ my posture
or however you spell
gummy youre hereby banned from your own land
can i have money
so heteromantic would be accurate
```[11:48 am] dragonite - guru of life: i had a dream that i was having a philosophical conversation with a girl i used to like and now i cant remember what the conversation was about```
talk to you weirdos later
he was always in a bad mood
interesting statistic: one in twelve people are born without a soul
ask my sis out
and congrats
someone get him hes getting away
i realize i'm probably just making this even worse for myself
(っ◕‿◕)っ?
youve streamed league?
gummy seems like he would be about 40% better to be around if you were completely fucking wasted
weirdly close to installing ffxiv
then it'll be 80
i should probably also re-install eso now that i have the hard drive space for it
my email is not in the system
nvm i forgot that one guy
the system requirements page says 40 gb though
i see
weird game
and there is a way to raise chocobos
that game sounds confusing
oh my
oh for god's sake
im making this gta 5
guess i could just fish up a last name that doesn't suck
what nonsense is this
okay hold mouse to strafe, i can live with that
no drago
just six days a week
the seventh day starts on sunday and ends on saturday
alright
you can have one
me too
but i have borderline ocd
looks like me playing dishonored 2 on minimum settings lmao
drago those are flubs’s panrs
god damn it sis
you humiliate yourself, i just laugh at the results
$224 for me
do you want my pc fried drago?
also the message didnt mention you by name did it
cure me and my morals
mission complete now to get food because im always hungry
nice.
how you know?
because that's what you always go for.
i love french fries.
i hate everything
i still cant get the image of superman's decked out rgb pc  out of my head whneever oyu mention it
actually it's 903.11 united states dollar
its like something one of my dumbass cousins would buy lol
that is enough pc upgrades for this year hopefully
well a potato can generate electricity under certain circumstances
we're havin steak and roasted potatoes tonight hell yea
do not anger the potatoes
unless provoked
and i prefer the more general term "vegetable" thank you
flubs he's saying you dont get enough exercise
i did not expect that answer
you only play golf with others if someone has an ulterior motive
mmmmhmmmm
do any of you people know what im talking about in gummyland?
kendall and i aren't even watching the chat
it's whatever
everything is whatever \:d
i'll hit y'all up later
we should vc again soon
gummy get out of bed and go for a walk
fine i’ll do the get out of bed part
it's good for you
thats too much
so we don’t have a mailbox
well..
he’s not ban in my server but he pisses me off
is that code
oh so it was for being a butthole mostly. thats valid
everytime someone wanted to discuss about a villains
i rather mod flubs than him there
well the user account was from another country but still
i was gonna say lmao
sos man, she must think really highly of you
is there a reason a disproportionate amount of bronies are batshit crazy?
not all, but a bunch more than youd expect
i know a bunch who are normal
yeah thats probably a big part of it. also the internet makes people weirder so thats probably a factor
so i'm not exactly the perfect candidate
like _actually_ mad
he doesnt count he argued with _everyone_
long gone
gummy that was like two years ago you should probably let it go at some point
why not? its like zeal but without any of the annoying people like gummy drago and master
even though im right here
actually i haven’t done anything crazy irl lately
zeal is weird
~~ida you didn’t even wanna join in the first place~~
except rainy
he threaten me to many times
eh, i'm good
but that might be because of the gay agenda
necro?
yeah
technically demon lord is the royal treasury im gummyland but he needs to hit the $100k mark
just you know more errr
explosive?
and probably sexist
won’t be a long stream but yeah
yeeeeeah
sexism and racist jokes aren’t okay
i just checked
my cou try sucks
but let's not get political
they can
there would just be consequences
plus jack dorsey apparently is mutual followers with a bunch of white supremecists so it's not like he wants to anyway
i feel like that would spark the renaissance faster though
also fuck the romans
as crazy as that is but yeah
gummy get out of bed and go play outside
another one in my server got banned in manechat <:facehoof:241025290875174912>
does yt not realize how long animation takes?
gummy how many youtube channels have you made now?
i have about 5 more
and streaming is worth it
i am also not banning people who are right unless they do something
we don't need to, i got it handle
gummy the baboon must be studied
idk why people want him gone
hmm bring sis in to chew him out then ban?
i doubt mods mind someone like that being banned
no not that
```[2:48 pm] dragonite: free speech doesnt mean everybody else doesn't have the right to tell you to shut your pie hole```
i forgot
like time out chair or bad boy corner
no one is seeing this
lol drago
too bad i can't give you the honours to ban
what opponents?
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
but what got him banned was
and what even is the whole unmotivated thing as abstruse locution what/
ahahaha
or why it's called taking a dump while you're leaving it behind
deeo
you think that's a lot?
like theres a 100% chance thats all he has to do today
yanis is great, but hes 15 so expect arrogance from him
>keeping you here a bit more because you're calling me "baby"
ask him if it was a straight pride rally, a milo rally or a kkk rally
and the people doing mass shootings dont seem like the tolerant type who want a bunch of no good [insert minority] filling up their heaven
and frencg
holy shit this server has never been this active since last year
if only the churches that are everywhere did psa's like that
this video is wonderful
i wanna know what a degenerate rally looks like in person but the more bodies show up the better it looks for _them,_ plus i wouldnt be caught dead at a kkk rally
i don't like spices, i'm white
i mean i used to play csgo but i had to stop cuz everytime i got headshot and heard that noise i would begin to shake and shitit
i hate saying it
this is a christian server we need more foul language in here
i mean ive had it but like its not like i do it every day xd
wait no thats fowl language
and make him feel very uncomfortable
good one
its still not that bad
perhaps you are approaching this from the wrong angle
oh by the way you have great taste in profile picture
aren’t you that guy
gyro is my favorite character in all of manga to this day
so i did it
growing numb to pain is the shit my dude
🏓 🎾 🏓
oh the i and a are in the opposite order
thats dumb
the next session is scheduled for 4:30 so youd better hurry up
you missed some great quotes
bringina: "local dictator takes a part time job at cafe, villages hope they dont get poisoned"
whats the context even
dont be so harsh on yourself flubs
im not an expert but i understand it. you cook it a bit then munch on it then digest it
who is big brian
i meant big brain
but i dont know what the third one is
kugal don't be ridiculous
thats a bit too much salt
and eyes
thats me when i lose my temper
but i usually flip something
guys
welp
also the guy who threatened to kill mlp villains is banned for 3 months on manechat flubs
well it is very salty
since you say anything that doesn't seem right and get jumped on
a friend of my mom said i look friendly
i fuckin love just dance
leaving zeal
i was only in it for the convienence of not changing my muscle memory but i found a way around it without the random pings
i mean im the one who went through with it so yeah
thats probably what caused the stomach pains
demon lord, how big is the sun and moon, not ultra sun and moon aftergame?
alright i’ll see what i can prepare
quick and painful
worst is clearly slow and painful. its not fun
they fuckin dead
lots of guys like that are not nice
i sense a market niche that needs to be filled
and have a constitutional monarchy
but he's nothing like that now
highly doubt it
this all started with vox and steven crowder
they _can_
and hateful stuff
thats a problem...
we need to gang up on someone else
though tbh...something about the old camelot days made it seem to be toxic
let's gang up on drago
i do gang up on myself
all in favour of getting rid of some channels/combining them?
i feel like self promotion and media should be combined
i guess media works for him
clear stuff up with stormy and hopefully be able to watch direct with her
prolly flubs then
time to **pun**ish him
kugal go to bed
blitz stop why beat me up? i was told you were nice over on this server
you should be
everyone's got the role that lets them screw with stuff
well i did take hm out on several pizza dates so
kugal why do you have to be such a great person
wow, amazing you'd go out of your way to compliment strangers, props for spreading positivity
that is not cute sorry dragon i gay so nude pics of men not my thing
hell yea
oh boy
no regal we're not contagious i swear!
dang it's worse than i thought
hamster 😮
dang
heck yes
i dont like you
it’s a puppy dragon
i’ll be back tomorrow but i need youtube to send me off to sleep world
see ya regel
i’ll show up maybe dragon
maybe perhaps perhaby mayhaps
mmkay im signin off nighty yall
this is forbidden
animal crossing
i don’t wanna post anything if you haven’t seen it
all trailers are now in <#563455726048247808>
because you want my money or you want me to talk
how so gummy?
i'm a bit surprised they're delaying it
i knew it will be a big game
if it was a copy paste from new leaf like how city folk was to wild world
i never said zelda games were garbage
new evolution not great but i obsessed with the new legendaries they my kin lol
huh uh
then big movie
okay i have officially watched drago’s selling out video
omggg
i love kiki
flubs you are adopted as well
flubs wtf is this
but i want superman to visit me
did someone actually take me?
because im currently having a side effect
trying to
well you might be right flubs
i know you like hi
nothing much regal
one percent of the time lol
he can’t annoy me trust me
she just can’t know i choose favourites
bud tomorrow aint thursday
june 12, and 13 are bad days for me
i going to the beach tommorow
good times
i don’t like too peaceful
also some cool people
devent
(i did not just say that because both of my sisters love black and white)
plasma in back and white was cool
thelastsane is crazy
btw demon lord tell me again
i asked you this since 2018??
oh you missed the stream today
oh yeah i was out probably
though some of the social features are locked
stormy likes it and having stormy around is very nice plus i never played those games
not sure how much of a zelda fan she is
sorry kay kay
showers with short hair are a breeze holy shit
skarm you didn't need to share that okay
see the shit we have to deal with?
my backs already destroyed so, come at me bitch
oh ok bye skarm
i mean
i mean, ill give it
drago is leaving, very quickly
threesome?
that game isn't even all that awesome.
they are there to make money
your face aint free
ive had worse
im a bit jumpy today and will be a lot jumpy tomorrow
yes it's 555-5555-555-5-5
oh boy
not thursday lol
every year but last year
lmao
i hear she has resurfaced
gossip amirite
how bout that
he didn't like it
and that the ratings pisses him off
bella's nice
even though she was mad at me one time for not knowing how babies were made
same honesly
i think that stupid crush on bella was what screwed me over
she always said i was like a little brother to her
a lot of drama
i dont hold it against ya :p
i know you
hey, i wasnt even paying attention, what was that for?
i see a rob
i only have like five dollars on me
i know a good rob
appreciate it xd
no jk
coming from him that's basically i love you
what?
no swimming allow here
sleep
dont let the bed bugs bite
alright blitzypoo
muskets
march to the battle
oh good, i have time
i play so many games
pour a bit in the pan
fuck yes
ram that bullet down
crazy
and the circle thing is the bullet
fine
i didnt even know i was hired
ive had weird drea,s
too many to count
tbh when are dreams ever normal
caught her with her ball mid yawn
i cant wait for pokemon fork and spoon
well.
but it's only thursday the 13th.
yeah it was no fun
someone took control over it
who took control over it?
“yoo gummy! everyone say hi to gummy, we met a long time ago when i had 10 subs”
i wonder if you even know him personally.
i dont think i've ever formally met him but good for him
it'd be different if you badgered him to do it
to be fair, to my knowledge, nearly 100% of people in here are your friend lol
that place is haunted for sure
theres fewer people and they are on average better
i just made my profile picture this in honor of pride month
plus i like the colors lol
also, all i did was ask why theres a d in fridge
"the other guy took more"
i see. kek.
but mostly ace
but nope.
yay!
pretty much
~~that's kinda gay~~
i had no wifi for like 5 minutes
what i miss?
that too
i wouldn't really want to have sex with a man.
are we human?
(depends)
(wait, no)
oh finally
i tend to be grumpy during this day
well yeah
minecraft
stormy's outro today was funny
im just tighter with everyone here
you and stormy were bickering over what to stream
same
talk to drago, he is there...i think
blitz do you blow?
its ok we've been on several pizza dates
going for walks is too tiring pretty much
new pic of him pls
i dont know if we're ready for that amount of beauty yet
plot twist flubs is a girl all along
he’s cool these days
i had this hung up my wall for a long time
(rest of the server besides flubs and blitz peeks in and says "yup, gummy lost his marbles")
it's basically cream soda with yellow food color
ida wanna play ffxiv yet
tbh it sounds like a scam
oh yea and thats another reason why i like being here so much more
been busy
later on you start going to a lot of funerals
im cry at my chicken'a funeral
sad sure but not like crying sad
we have 14 chickens
my parents just got home so i get to go hang with them in a bit and kick it live
dont tell my dad though
she just got so sick one weekend and it was time
u watch stephenplays? i knew i liked you
regal isn’t trust me
all right
same
good
prob asleep
mine is horrid
so ida lives in iceland and operates on new york time, and drago lives in new york time and operates on california time
guys guys
oh there will be
oh shit i just got it
i didnt know those wrist bands that absorb sweat are supposed to be used so you have em on your wrist so you can wipe your forehead until some tweet pointed it out
your face is a drago opinion on twitter
your pokemon thing
youre the one that lives here
nani
new favorite flavor
i should be studying but im playing pokemon
was wondering if you were up for league?
yeah.
ah lol
doesn't seem very biologically accurate
my brother was a big fan of tmnt way back
one of the best animated tv shows i've seen.
i like the 1987 version as well
that was a good one
t!top
flubsology is the study of flubses. thats a horrible field
od horribly
exactly
which are made of math
math is math!
lol yeah i remember first playing that game with my cousins
is probably one of the best mod choices i made
wtf how am i 6th?
yanis is a good mod. he silences people and thats funny
drago is very consistent. very consistently weird.
ah, will added it. forgot she liked it.
that's
fuck, ive been found out
he leaves it on a table and pokes the screen
are the stories referring to the same event?
hi star
even though it’s not against the rules
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115> <:revolver:582671595235966976>
nah most gens you can find plenty of pokemon or trade
black and white instead of trying to do that soft reboot should have picked only a hand full of popular pokemon from past gens
like pikachu
no fucking way in hell they should have tried that
"in the newest zelda game, link will be paid dlc released 6 months after launch"
btw idk about you
honestly there are worse fates
speaking of which i should probably open my bday present from you soon
i got things to do today
im still streaming
nice
lol flubs btw there was a crazy hippie at the beach the other day
i wanna be his friend
he also had a crazy husky dog which was super aggressive and it was p-u-s-s-y
it was also named dracula or something close to that
someone with multiple hips
nah man im asleep
kugal quit it with the niceness its hurting my feelings
sounds fun
gummy
i just broke my chair
😏 sexy
well shit
nothing you could ever eat tastes as good as being healthy feels, but eating tastes good now and health feels good in 6 months - 10 years
im playing zoe
its the worst
gumym
accurate though, demon
me too, if i eat fast food i have bad poopoos
teach that dog the word of the lord kugal
its too much of a coincidence between all of the cultures that they all predict an afterlife for there not to be something
so everyone goes to hell since most religions need you to be of their religion to get into their heaven
what if all the afterlives are mixed together into one big one, but you need to meet all the criteria to get it?
if the two gods are equal gummy, that means i have all the power of humanity - one weird crippled guy
am not religious but take me to church is one of me favorite songs
dont need to be religious to be unhappy tho 😎
even 20 years ago it would've been social suicide to say something like that
im intrigued
im not fully sold but ill try it
hell, all of us could be wrong, it could be something none of us can fathom
why die tho
ok done with my duolingo
i would vouch for it
you were pretty deep in the closet, you said to me that same thing one time, that being gay is bad
go ahead
i dont think you should sterotype voices lol
im gonna head to bed fellas, have a good night
if you can das fine lol
welcome to my world
you and me are like you and my sister, since we fight over nonsense most of the time, and ida's like my brother, who's usually looking on and going what the crap is wrong with you two
oh true
i'm 100% slavic.
flubs i will sue you
i do that in bed silly
i bad at movies i try to finish it tonight maybe
ida i meant regal
whoops
can i be your third sister?
maybe
what was the other core subject
im a boy, got the xy
if i could find a mate who was also a math boi i would die
will do drago
good!
i too anti social for the pride parades lol
he's upping the pressure on me to get a girlfriend
tell him that you agree and think you should be enrolled in more math classes
i like it
no it isn't
there's a whole day to go
im pretty sure when that happens the game poofs out of existence
interesting
great well least it was free
at least i'll be making moola
purple is one of the best colors, though.
leave it the way it was.
but if you want it that way then keep it becuase that's just my dumb opinion lmao
shhh
no stay dead
they watch
iron_female
it’s actually a real thing
so what if others can see my nipples?
because chemistry and biology
that's like asking a rock to be a rock
you look stoned
drago 1, drago 0
if kugal taped puppet eyes to his face would he be a googaley koogally?
i would hold a calculus text book like youre holdin a skyrim book
also gummy
lol xd
he's as tall as a skyscraper if not taller lol xd
even though it is one in the morning and bunny is probably sleep
that was my dad lmao
shouting is fine to an extent
huge example one guy kept giving ownership to random people and getting it back then one day he lost it and got kicked
oh yeah
made a new server and did it again
you are ambassador to gummyland here
lol it is
*thank* you
floral who knows tb is crazy
benny can be the cute little mop of anger
but she broke up with him since he said no to sex
thonk
so ask benny what he wants to add to this server?
he said nothing but he glared at me
it just broke
ive installed this app that my sister told me about that connects you to lgbt people and ive already got this 15 year old guy asking if we can be bfs lmao
get a room
it wasnt a dream, that how i spent my morning
sure
well flubs just buy me a drink first
i mean if a nuclear war was gonna start its probably pakistan and india but besides that and the class imbalance its great
also since i wrote that i can never become the president of the united states
president flubs
go ahead
damn
gummy knock it off
pupper 💖
people are so interesting in their ways
went to specialist to learn i just need more fiber
oh no
that shit is disgusting
haaapppyyy birthhdaaay toooo youuuuuuu
then again, smile more, it looks good on you 😉
thanks for the idea kugal
okay gummy fine you can have a happy birthday. but not too happy.
gummy you can have seventeed hours of happiness but after that it's $4.99 an hour
thanks sis and drago
you are 22 and im 19
and now we are both legal to drink in canada..
still
you should probably surrender now
gummy i challenge you to an orange juice chugging competition
apple juice pls
gummy
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
yeah
hes like a young ida
youre a bad judge of character
right now drago
hes gone
im sorry for roasting you ida
that was bootiful
like if i tell you that your servers economic policy is backwards and rooted in your personal bias, thats good advice. if i tell you to be taller because you look like a troll at your current height, thats bad advice
or that one fellow who has been mighty strange lately
im so happy im on a new phone on a new plan
damn thats a good pup
im offering free hugs to all
i did it
nothing
a nonexistent price to pay for salvation
but when i stream animal crossing, all a sudden new viewers join and talk
and beat them with nets
implying my room has a lock
wait coke as in coca cola? or err.... cocaine?
only to be replaced by yanis
haters gon' hate hate hate hate hate
anyone who joins now will automatically get a role where they cannot embed links nor post pictures
hey you should all visit (remove the spaces)
i don’t get why zeal isn’t raided as much?
link is public
i thought you did drago
discord me is open
plus link is in the description of eyan’s videos
you gotta fight benny for it
we should meditate on butts
i expect it to be delivered before yesterday at noon
fucking drinking i thought would be cool
it's not tasty for me.
that's what alcohol does.
also the withdrawls can kill you
drink with me drago
gummy i think it's past your bedtime
and a geek
im bored
it's raining
and all you have to do to move around in 3d space is multiply your current matrix with your updated transformation matrix!
just talked with my dad for like an hr so that was something
flubs are you wet?
how fun
either way i thought it look so good
nocturnal emissions are fun
i talked on the phone for an hr and 13 minutes
and that drained 7% of the battery
then their products sucked
wiat
because its fabulous
it only has like 510 cameras
but yeah that'll be a bit later, gotta do a few things right now lol
oh ok
gummy why i thought getting trolled was fun
here is the thing
it should.
as for floral...she keeps going back and forth on dating tb or not
you will see embarrassing deaths
wait, no, they already made dumb n dumber
so flubs im going to steak place on monday
mine!
drago, what do you have against ham?
oh yeah the bot does that
ham is good
i've been eaten.
i forgot he existed
shhh
who needs alcohol...when you got this
drago doesn’t get one
it's his favorite reason.
drago...no giving her ideas
"keep the stupid deaths cummin gum"
not yet
gummy you missed the coin
then kill it
thonk
gummy keeps dying like a silly pants
when i did that stuff i was 16/17
i give dragos 1.1
i had the best league game ever
code blue
you know
the reason why i like you more is...you didn’t give me a death card for my bday
gummy wanna do my homework for me
you already have no pride.
eew get it off my screen
i meant dragonair
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
oh i need to add you as a friend
which server are you on? if you're logged in you should see it above the minimap.
feeling a tickle on your face and then wiping that spot with your hand to see it was an ant
becuase that sounds fun
done fuck all, have you?
no that's race
what level are you btw drago?
no, it's subscription based
khajiit has wares, if you has the coin
sorry sis..
gummy how dare you not play video games
i just haven't gotten the time or commitment
i also happen to be following you around
is that going to get me killed
oh cool i hav ea fire thing
lemme see if i can figure out how to put it on
wow your connection to the server is worse than mine
the game doesn't realize i'm disconnected
like i can still walk around and stuff
the first dungeon is unlocked at the level 15 main story quest
i will catch up when i have time
kugal is being generous with his pizza
just got done stuffing my face
btw kugal have you heard rainy's voice on stream yet?
yeah i'm still a mod on stream but i left the server too
well if he by some miracle starts making youtube videos again maybe i’ll watch
i still like the streams though
he has with me anyway
but i enjoy watching league most of the time
my mom got me these chocolates where its these dark chocolates filled with caramel and its so yummy
nash
but you can even feel like shit when you stream!
for stream i can
we get along really well
got my new external harddrive set up
the idea is so innocent and cute
well pokefusion is trending on twitter and it’s terrifying
problem is..i don’t remember
im going to go out on a limb and guess that it was to treat my channel like a business and not go "ehh i like making videos i guess"
drago sleep
im not even trying to now
i believe my mom was still a teenager when we landed on the moon
have you even seen twitter?
it's actually not, space is far too empty for there to be any reasonable chance of a direct hit from anything
see? qed, fools!
i would die, but yes i do scream
thats not a pokemon
point is something something honour something
don’t encourage this...
i gave you the purple i guess role
gummy can't kill you if you kill him first
helllp flubs
bye gummy, nice knowing you
also that would cause me to lose all my data and stuff
well if your parents are bipedal and have arms, that probably means they're of the homo genus
i wish
both you are sis
no you smart
hey that was me last night
lucky you
i'll wake up at 6 pm
i feel bad for going to bed cause my hound won’t share but i have headache
i know right
well i going to try to go to bed now hopefully dogs are good
if i strangle you but only partially you might pass out
what about mathematical hugs
the ratio of the average cross-sectional distance and the perimeter of your arms is pi
but he likes being howled at!
nooo i missed sis being drunk
mathematical hugs are just as great
and then i had work
retail sucks though
or the delivery guy doesn’t steal my medical stuff or whatever happened to my last order
well at least it's probable that people will land on mars in our lifetimes
and a certain person should know what im doing
did you remove the punctuation?
flubs i know what you did
(sarcasm) lets get sis porn for her bday, she certainly won’t disown me and kill me
screw you
why did you put ida in a box
i want both.
well animal man showed up today
so it would be basically too tempting to use on gummy.
it was doctor drago in the conservatory with the hylian shield
too much purple
at least according to my friends list
i don’t want any more zeal connections
nothing screams fancy like deep fried potato
i feel a light buzz
it means your blood alcohol content is too low
nice
wow you revel
now time to hide my celebration drinking activities from sis
borrow drago’s microwave
and i’ll buy it off you
only if its scalding
thank god i don
and no drago
that is?
but consider me
but yeah...walmart probably need to apply online
they told me they aren’t hiring right mow tho
and far places that i can’t get to easily
you mean you'll get addicted?
streaming
asking for some....reasons
asking which one you should play?
neat
it's about accurate too
big balls for someone who pissed on the couch earlier today
the screenshot?
but im gonna do...
sure drago
bios?
stormy will just tell me what to say
we just finished
she sort of likes me the most
that's good to hear.
woah
i dont know if it actually saved me any time but it was fun to make right?
because it sounds funny
who runs this server btw?
and i guess skarm
yeah star
i'll proceed to transfer ownership to an alt who's attached to a ten minute mail with a jibberish password that i won't be able to recover
floral's ex
but floral broke up with tb and went with his ex
i paid $200 for that
we need someone to stir up trouble
necro or candyman anyone?
yeah thats a fun way to say hello
i think if he does do youtube it shouldnt be anything too ambitious or he might fall into that hole again of coming back at full power and then have no energy after a week
oh i thought you did
but fuck let's plays
i should do a let's learn
your health is important
it's a dnd joke but i think you might like it for the angry bun
idk what to think about it...
i meant in gummyland
you have weird dreams
probably redo nsmb 3
videos will remain the same
hey gummy do you ahve a big fat spreadsheet of your youtube stuff?
might just re-record everything tbh
what about noponz
ah rip lol
he wants porn
i went through another youtube crisis
yeah idk man maybe my soul is shutting down
don't die
a soft restart
just different overlay
so i get double the deaths!
ive had 2 wrong numbers call/text me today
they influence our friendship i guess
(yes really)
lmao
trying to get my caregiver to text me wats in the food she left me cause it looks like beef and i don’t eat beef
yeah thats gangstery lol
for rarity it should be "darling i know u love me"
apparently not
rubbing alcohol?
i was thinking methanol but sure
yeah it’s a pain but there worth it ofc i have the new 2ds xl so i dunno about regular
now those strangers will know im smarter than them
“do you do outdoor activities”
you can though
in fact ts real easy
not final fantasy
oh cool it's updating that's fun
oh a dragon just got stuck in it somehow
no. my dog. go away
ida am i allowed to play as a dragon in this game
which i hear is terrible to work at
like sonic
july 12 is important guys
drago it’s also almost 3 years of knowing each other
~~twitch streaming with gummy can be a job~~
i know
17-20
no one told me the 2ds xl needed that
im pretty proud of myself
or a lion man
er, exactly how does this "cast interrupted" thing work
or a silence even
sword has a dark souls boss in it lmao
hey some advice from adults needed
yay.
also don't let them make you feel guilty either
that happened with my first 3ds
i happen to know a thing or two about that from my own father
one of the shoulder buttons would stick
i'm good at taking care of my stuff i swear
i got $65 gamestop credit
drago stop breaking things
can i have it>
oh okay
flubs can i have it
i think will might still be stuck down there actually
fucking on thing i hate about 2ds xl and where you insert your game
well we already knew i was weird but now we know gummys 3ds peripherals are weird too
oh so you smack it on there and it charges it without annoying wires in the way?
bad food doesnt taste good
let's see my self is currently:
30% programming
30% one piece
maybe 20
alright
be weary
oh no then i can't have him, mom wants clean carpets
weary is probably the worst named emote of them all
oh boy
so start rewatching the first 73 episodes of bleach got it
im very excited
i tried sleeping but my blood sugar felt low so im all shaky and weird waiting for this ice cream to soften so i can eat it
oh crap
and now i having another issue let’s see if reinstalling works
cause i don’t use mods so i dunno what the problem is
i fell asleep
my dad is disappointed in me becuase me and one of my female friends havent indulged in anything nsfw together
you trickster
but you don't want to sword fight your non-romantic lady friends becasue thatd be too dangerous
did i say that
duolingo has mommy issues
theyre making a fourth season this fall
i know
i've heard some interesting stories about grindr on r/gaybros
the gay reddit subs have such original names
dad: you gotta show me how around grindr
no not in the good way
simon: dad what do you think grindr is?
yup lmao
lpt: lots of people in the exact same situation at christian events
i wanna play with you
any peeps alive
ida do i want to know
ask drago about that
and someone had left a light pole in the middle of the walkway
i not i just really confused
well i couldnt watch it the minute it came out!
well
see?
yes star
doesnt seem fair but sure
he wont have the courage to fight back
but he acts tough
and he looks tough
she will
gummy you're already gold in my eyes
it got real quiet real fast
yeah
kinda
im constantly in a weird mood
it’s a gay thing probably
just a small town girl
she took the midnight train goin anywhere
im gonna go have dinner peeps
dammit
tomorrow isnt pride month anymore
lmao dont do that
what hes saying is that now you have to be *really* homophobic for the next 30 days
flubs that made me laugh way too hard
but that's what his dad spent all month doing
tell me hopw fabulous they look
lmfao
im always doing something gay
the gayest
oh yea he doesnt
ah right right
there's more compliments where that came from
i have to kiss a guy
hmm my throwback
lmao
drago you never beat me up in the past
how can you throw a car, if you're so small a mini car is taller than you.
my knee hurts and i blame gummy
i know
oh thank god
drago you won’t like beans and shrimp
drago hitting us with the absolute hot takes
without watching eyan
i apparently have the number of maria now
sis’s name is mordred
wouldn't she prefer less dread, though?
kugal you're a builder and worker in stone.
gummy you were named after my middle name
gummy your name is officially "mr bumbledink"
he knows my full name.
you have rainy’s name regal
it’s just spelt differently
like the christmas kind
there was an incident on ss forums where someone accidentally guessed my last name by shipping me with another user named "lord penguin"
or fen but no one in real world calls me that
well outside of d and d but haven’t played in forever
i guess sis’s name
bad dragon bad dragon
they were never this weird in zeal
yay peanut butter
only if you birng the ice cream
regal's bringing ice cream
ok gang kugals gotta go
no i was hungry
my own charlie howling cause mommy gone

blitz is err 72
nice shirt
god shit on the kaiser!

uuuuuuuh
(╯°д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \\)
i vaguely remember the matrix math i did on my own accord a year ago
i solemnly swear that i am up to no good
i would never listen to youtube
but after a while who cares
you nuke pluto
ooooooh ok
my dad goes gambling every now and again and every time i swear he wins like 2 grand
pc, xbox, playstation, and nintendo switch

the bot says otherwise.
lmao
i don't want it
im his biggest fan
let me know if he’s like a good neighbor
how you know amazon was my second choice?
oh yea true 😦
lmaooo
today kugal didnt have time to do gay stuff
he had to adult and get his bank account situated
ida why you do this to me
all the guys in that last picture are the same guy
aww how sweet of you
yeah, sounds good
this is confusing
dang you younger than gummy whoops sry i thought you were older
that's fine i get it more than you think lol
yeah totally didn’t mean to hit on you kugal
kugal in a blitz
ida your special gift will be delayed...
i thought you just has changed and weren’t getting stuck in the basement anymore
kugal you're adopted
for example he cant stop shouting how gay he is
regal kugal and i just spent all of last night in the kissing booth i think youre going to have to try a little harder if you want to achieve tmi
regal was decidedly not in the kissing booth with us
i mean, im not even gay, i just like making things weird, and saving it for later would be the antithesis of making things weird
kugal do you know any cute single dragon girls?
i know that feeling all too well having been raised by a single mother
bb in a few minutes you guys are cheering me up
ask him if he prefers carbon, potassium or uranium
there was one time when my dad got upset with me over not wanting to get the lion king on snes
what the
yes, really
i must have been mad at him that day lol
i  back with fresh underwear
getting out of bed is hard
im not depressed i dont think but i have a tendency to sleep in till 3 pm
the latest i've slept in was 5 pm lmao
i tried promoting my deviantart no biters
great one of the only surveys i qualify for money on breaks goodie
how do you search up users lol
im back again
lets see dis bootiful art of yours
game reviews aren’t me

ew boobs
maybe you could try the crime of sharing cute puppy pictures everywhere without permission
king corphish
king nappy fell
keep it classy, pokétubers
regel guess how many gay youtubers im subbed to
youre only subbed to 30 people?
not 30
37.1
that's too rational of a number
you forgot we are missing someone
i miss him
i'm too busy being sad all the time to be mad
after windows update
gummy that sounds like a real good way to get her mad at you
drago you need an update as well
did someone say bollocks 👀
we used to have a lot of kitties
guess my parents we're just allergic?
cute.
it starts one minute in
let's go with 10 for now
sweet
tyler oakley
sounds about right
wouldnt the dude get lonely
one girl two cups anyone
hes an innocent boi
but anyway even if you dont get the original joke, the second joke is that i'm apparently using a girl's name on a business account
there now we have the three stooges role
so gummy should pipe down
in wonder how many words i've said in my life, and what percentile that puts me in for all of humanity
god damn it
it doesn’t matter guys
that's a star in some constellation somewhere that's probably going to explode when it dies
hmmm
alrighty, have fuuuun
also i'm always around it's just that my silly phone would say i'm offline when i go on something else that isn't discord lol
haha yeah i dont want to slee
but i should if i want tomorrow to not suck
am i the only one who doesnt really care about the fireworks
sleep
west coast gang
she's even more cultured than i am
aaaa
that's the plan anyway
kk, nighty night
oh no
take it easy then
sorry sis that your other gift never happened
hah nerd
some 60s thing
we know it's you.
kugal youre not allowed to not play video games
so the switch lite is coming out in september apparently
just in time for 2 years of knowing each other
it’s cheaper and less fun
no drago
either that or i thought you would hate my guts
flubs will help me
free slurpee
tell us
can i have some?
why do you even want the meds though
and it's in a nice case
who wants to keep this place active?
i am sorta
flubs i just check my server
server too huge gummyland i mean
vaping is gross
do they still all hate each other?
it's a danganronpa reference
it's open, boiled, and in your hair
im here friendos
i can put it in the gutter in _half_ that time
youre pretty dang good
is seeing how fast you can hurl a ten-pound mass
thats how i won against like 4 other people one time lmao
which is 14.3 mph
shrimp!
like the part where they're basically massive bugs?
we're just trained to be disgusted by bugs
but cattle isn't sustainable for the rest of the world to all eat at our rate
bison
bison is supposed to be healthier than cattle for proteim
e^x * dx/dy
dy/dx (e^x) ?
no thanks i tried bothering my calc teacher with int(sqrt(xx+4)) and he just said "no you cant do that, go use a calculator"
if it was a hot tub you could say it was a boiling pot of water with other people and people would start asking interesting questions
yea!
thonk
it opened yay lol ^w^
she is probably the best person to cut my hair
well i like smashing keyboards
fluba
so glad to have her back
demon lord
sis and i need to hang out more
i hear hes cool
kugal, i'll hang with you
nothing wrong with some cannibalism to start your day
you guys make my heart melt
flubs
happy 2 years of knowing each other
i can't
say what?>
gummy that's your morning routine
that's one dang expensive box
i got a haircut
my brother likes pineapple actually
it's fibus
i had pizza
no thanks
benny shouldnt have pizza its got cheese on it
ask drago
part of me is arguing with myself
skarm same
i just broke another one of my dishes
sorry if i worried you guys, but i thought it was important for me to be upfront with you guys
but i realized i'm not gonna feel better if i don't reach out
and the offer on the hug still stands
i didnt have like a 4 hour dinner lmao
the feel loving one, for example
ya boy got a switch
it's for benny
oh jeez your anti-leaching off of her
gummy there was a scene in stranger things when lucas was like "max and i already broke up five times" and i thought of you immediately
he hates me
oh gummy i know the strat there
which one is sarah?
oh shush its her fault
sure why not its a funny story
flubs, buddy, you have _really_ bad luck when it comes to girlfriends
luckily
i guess everyone has their demons
oh hai flubs
no i did not kill her, this is not true this is bullshit. i did ***not***
i also didnt poison her
no youre his master
i need to get in contact with your aunt immediately
he likes shirts
thats literally my entire outlook on life thanks for distilling my being into a single sentence. not gonna haunt me at night. nope
true
the fuck
i don't think i'm qualified
maybe sis should train my staff...
so how are you sis
you're not alone
tbh i think we'd all be a bit happier if it weren't for social media
like i used to always grind school but i havent really done so since its summer and my brain has just been like "you degenerate of a human get to work"
thats good sis
i'm trying to find groups of computer people physically located \*somewhere in new jersey\* who i could go meet as part of the "making friends" part of finding a job
"i halp"
gummy
but i thought you liked my math stuff?
this is certainly an eye opening experience
yeah, just not always great for _gummy_
so i asked her whats wrong and she said her other ex bf threw a tantrum because she wanted to live stream with me over watching stuff with him
why is everyone on the internet a goddamn child
flubs dont ask questions you already know the answer to
ok but if they arent dating why does he care what she does and why does she care what he thinks
yeah but still. it seems like all the gears in this broken watch and stopped
idk but he only attacks when she and me are streaming
he gets custody bc hes known her longer? fuckin idiot
gummy how can you be so consistently smart and dumb like this at the same time
then we arent friends any more >:(
no need to waste time
hey no nuking servers is my thing
im literally meeting this guy at bronycon in two weeks
gummy if you actually suspect there's going to be a physical confrontation contact the security desk and tell them
i can’t wait to meet drago at magfest
i should show up to magfest but not say so, and then nobody would figure it out
top ten best pranks
drago looks like discount drago
drago. he does it
yeah but since hes finished a series
ah yeah
last one was black & white 2
was it really that common
stop being old
well a 15 year old shouldnt be dating a 12 year old
flubs are you 7?
im 7 too
i'm a newborn plus or minus 23.8
vanilla with chocolate syrup
go boil your head
who me?
no one is at this age
me marrying ida sounds like a good way for me to get murdered by ida
same with flubs
thing is
im quite timid irl
flubs i wanna meet you as well
on a side note, i would also rather wait till trump is out of office before i travel to the d.c. area
my dog is not the alcoholic in our relationship
sorry for getting political there but yeah
no thats just a good idea
looking at dc from an airplane, 15 minutes away from congress and the whitehouse are neglected neighborhoods that nobody wants to invest money into fixing. really says a lot about congress' activities
both go east to west and theyre exactly the same
google maps doesnt even give the parkway its numerical designation lmao
trains do not work
dont know
there's a relatively small county road which relatively minor construction began in 2015, was supposed to take a few months and finally finished in late 2017
im not sure we're both about to find out
speed limits should be ignored if traffic conditions make them unsafe 💯
excuse you i _like_ doing 60 in the 65 zone
my dad is the expert of always sticking with the speed limit, even if it means not going with the flow of traffic. we'll be on the freeway doing 60 when everyone is doing 70 and he'll be like "look at all these idiots!"
drivers here are slightly less horribl
theyre all special
im glad i was looking down at my phone or i prolly would've shat my pants
last week this semi truck came like 2 inches away from smushing my dad and i on the freeway
that seems like a weird case where you would use `me and my dad`
the rule is "if you would say `me` without `other person` it's `[other person] and me`, otherwise it's `i`
are basically the same
oh ok
we should abolish language
people tell me rust is fun to work with, and lately ive been talking to a guy who lives and breathes in haxe
i mean i've got both those endings in nier automata, t was funnier though
since i have no idea what we're talking about, w
which is why i sleep on my stomach, but according to every chiropractor, that is the act of a madman and you should never sleep on your belly
really?
flubs you were weird before this
just hide it behind the big rock, nobody'll see it there probably
no we all know it's his rarity body pillow xd
yea i would say that's accurate
maybe you need an older sis
or only with me because of money
i only have one sister and she's absolutely horrible.
flubs why is all my compliments offensive and my insults are non offensive?
good
drago why is it everytime you buy something, and then they announce better stuff?
brot
i'm died
like my viking sis
skinny jeans are fabulous
so kiddies
this is like 4 keyboards in total in less than one year
swimming in money sure is fun though
all i want right now is stormy
no flubs
i don't know if i've ever been to baltimore
“gummy do you think about anything other than food?”
even though she let us go early
any glasses you wear are your cute glasses kugals
yay gummys a bully
that same guy also showed me his private part twice
do i have to sign in order for you to set it on fire?
oh bully, kugal is here
this place is bully
i knew he had it in him
how do you bully
flubs bully animal man
two girls one dude
damn camelot is making us all not violent
nobody is gonna fight back against the dude in a wheelchair, so i dont bully
sis was violent
you stayed the same
you can do it demon lord, demons are pretty violent.
be specific
actually i'm asexual so it doesn't really matter to me
is that gummy's?
i believe that is charlie the dog's wrist
this is me<:charlie:579566514248744963>
that’s benny’s wrist
nighty night
medicine can expire?
most of the time it won't do what it's intended to do, and depending on the compound it could introduce new unfortunate things
which was dumb in its own right
thanks drago
have fun with that i guess
no grenades or rocket launchers? amateurs
thanks kugal
you know what
lmao
either way she did say one thing
well reviews are mixed so i was just wondering
im thinking about making a survey for gumland
gummyland is like a reactor powered by explosions that uses its created power to regenerate itself
exactly. its stable but extremely fucking chaotic
skarm shut up
all in favour of inviting squid and rc?
and drago don’t you put me down?
sigh
thats my name shut up
my name is supergummying
you calling drugs, meds makes sense
mason dope
also wait are the roots 0 -3 and -4? im very rusty with this stuff
i could probably find out what it is but she clearly doesn't want it out there so i won't try :p
do you remember if i had a reason, steve?
didnt gummy also guess my name? i forget
i know right
but i cannot say it or i get beat up
paul
well i meant dan lol
there was only like one class in high school i was in where there was another dan
it was a food class
gummy probably remembers who i'm referring to lol
yes i know
i know there was at least one tim hortons in rochester but i didn't have a car then and i wasn't about to get on my bike to go to fast food
although i suppose
i'm almost positive there's one in new jersey _somewhere_ but it sure isn't near me
you should give lessons
flubs give me your waller
mine has the imperial legion symbol thingie on it, you can';t have it
mines just a brown leather thing from the 30s or something
oh you know what
anyone wanna join?
pretty expensive
flubs i nominate you to be the next man on the moon
alternatively just wait a couple billion years till the sun goes red
hi sisters
my ffxiv character posing like a fate/stay night character
i deactivated my twitter a few days ago
mom: grandma, these are your pants that you left here
grandma: why do you have my pants?
gummy i think she meant she was sure she didn't wanna watch it lol
mom: you brought them over because you wanted to wash them but didnt have a full load of laundry
me too
hey gummy i hear youre in the market for another sibling
drago you can't date your siblings
according to both us and canadian law
the third party is you
i've got a question
time to retrieve it tomorrow
steak
oooh
eh i hit enter too early
pizza with a topping of steak. the fun part comes in that bits of steak are dropped onto the pizza as its being cooked so you never know if the next hit if meat will be brown, blue, pink, or almond
alright brbr imma go get steak
i'll share with drago since he's my date
im back with my steak
flubs, buck you. i don't want to sleep, i want to stay awake.
flubs fuck you
im not dating gummy im dating kugal
you know it
parents came remember
mondays don't exist
look it's not my fault you never learned the days of the week
<#542153256898658319>
how do you know if a bar is gay or not? did you see it making out with another bar?
hehe
i don't know why you're going but i've been through similar experiences since i was a kid
<:wat:579563576914870333>
he was blowing it up
gummy if it makes you feel any better i'm sure there are already a ton of suspected murderers already in your province
my keyboard is so cheap but i love it
i dont know if that would actually make you feel better or not
and this is where bad luck starts
which is also missing the shift key
sis you need a new laptop
depends on whether you plug it into the port next to the heat sink or not
and that had button issues
>there's already that thing added?
no problemo friendo
that or we just made the volcanoes angry
volcanoes are human enthusiasts confirmed
how do you know master?
shit
after gummy dies, i take dips on his pc!
sis gets that as well
thanks.
i will try out that windirstat program.
that thing
reminds me of windows defender lmao
thanks flubs
but i wont
no risk, no obligation, no red tape, no down payment
i got my debit card today pog
should also probably get a stock market account set up and invest once the next correction hits
sounds lit
you're lit, gummy!
y'all are lit
i've only got an interest checking and a money market account
get drago to put it out
why the ***fuck*** am i green
animalunderscoremanunderscore
that's all you should be doing
you better not
nein
right now i am working on bringing the server to a staple 200
i mean, i might leave the computer, but discord will still be on
animal\_man\_
f30252
i prefer dixie land though
and that is lincoln's fave song
interesting
everything else is light
even on windows
damn it
and cooking mama
omg that looks exactly like my cat
e!role thing
try that
back from dinner follks
awesome
but almost getting hit by a car is like almost dying
nothing crazy there, everything in the order of operations makes sense
now ive heard of george carlin
good
no, it was a schutzstaffel office.
but yeah he was very lively
he died 11 years ago
“if my doctor told me i had only six minutes to live, i wouldn't brood. i'd type a little faster.” 
― isaac asimov
what i was just talking about with not dwelling on life he really addresses that starting at around 38 mins
gummy forcing me to be social
so hi bitches
wait no
thats starlight
really
best description of punic wars ever
i did update
yeah drago, you need an update
fen can be a brosister
gummy, you know what you gotta do.
but we're all very homo
he's pretty talented
it was random really lol
you same age as me cool
im pissy right now star
tmnt?
you know i realize it's probably on github
to be fair i wouldn’t mind some hand holding action
i face palmed so hard
he’s won’t eat him
it was dark an hour and a half ago
i'm like 95% sure the mets are going to lose
i mean i get the part where a solid half of all games are derivatives of ping pong
youre 100% sure the mets are gonna lose drago
bc i was raised a yankees fan
how awful
oh hell yeah
im only in gamemaker and letsplay and a couple others that only get like one post a day like pokemonrmxp and stuff
everything drago does is fun and good (:
okay fine i'll make them take a bath
im like a very pale white on a good day
shes plotting to take over gummyland once and for all
oh jeez sorry about the spoilers then
it’s that time of the week again where i question how well i am as a server owner
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115>
i just worked opening to closing
how many hours is that? :|
master i finished up the kepler thingy no one took up the offer before i finished the lesson feelsbadman lol
the bad news: mom's phone decided to bug out so they can't scan our tickets to let us in
the good news: today is mr met on the moon day at citi field and they still have some left when we arrived
welcome to the future
i figured out how to make my ffxiv character read
/r/brandnewsentence
it's the max level
but now it has confirm to also be ending
go skydiving, try some meth, see a play

drago went to an alternate universe

thonk
not me
cause you are constantly tired so i gotta keep you away
gummy i had an opportunity to give you a war cry
apparently i'd manage to get int
or perish
is that an `and` or `or`
gotcha
no i meant thanks
not even the || redacted ||
and then she killed me again
since i don't do the whole betray people very well
since they do it too much
yeah i am too tbh
what me?
we need to find a new game
speaking of which i havent played that in a while
fine i will download it now
oh my god yes
the third joke is that i'm too uncreative to come up with more than one fictional name in my life
thanks sis
which still lets you try all of the classes
you should be fine doing that until you figure out a more directed approach
iirc i have fire, ice and one that i don't really know what is for
commentary
gummy you sure you dont want to commentate? i wanna hear _your_ voice
good point
basically my ex told me not to be stupid in front of her sister which is like ida and me, they aren't actually blood related
rip x 2
musket
muskets
it's `ex`, from _that_ stage
<a:a_wild_gremlin:590514192507994132>
im gonna call it that from now on cos i like that name a lot more
<:ponkohyouknow:525081375888506883>
hacker yes
<:pinkie_awkward_smile:636655055134785558>
i deny all allegations of attempting to give bringina chocolate with hot sauce and hot mustard
i'm just showing
chicken? extra no.
oh you don’t like chicken
well mitch we should see if we can drag tenda in
if she hasn’t slept
also some vandalized the first nations university
wow im dumb
i really want a hot dog now
but point is to not act stupid
e!bot
lets switch for a day then flubs
disgusting
like gums when he was young
but vietnam
so i've just been informed of some rather
“young people in vietnam continue to be taught at home and at school that same-sex attraction is a “disease” and a “mental illness” that can be cured and treated, despite legislation designed to support and protect lgbtq+ rights.”
so he has a terrible infection in his hand, which has spread to his arm
he is expected to make it through to summer
yeah
3. don't invade russia at all unless you can conquer siberia before october starts
what
pretty much
kugal you should probably play the kingdom rush games too
ask sis
but 90% of them are great updates
exactly
forgot to do that lately
okay
he only has like 45k subs
if your pokémon series is binomial or higher i'm not interested
what the hell is a binomial?
gums with bringy and with tenda lurking around
thanks flubs
216 questions lets go
who?
then i learned where poland was and thought "oh that explains why it gets invaded by russia so often"
jeans look nice though
why is pic so bad?
and i didn't realize there was a middle ground
the two will connect together after destroying poland
that's like saying sparta survived till today, implying they were still a self sufficient city state
most of my history comes from the bean people over at extra credits
they were just called the german empire
in some cases the epic covers are just completely unmodified
so how were athenians on equality?
in grade 10 class
not like roman slaves or something like that
which was followed by ww2 and us being cut off from denmark and basically going "screw this"#
that'd make tug-o-war more interesting
i bet they were called the dark ages because it was before they'd invented the light bulb
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
then fucked thwm right back when they were weak
ouch
$47 in total for gas
so probably
i always get a new followers
i take it someone didnt make it through
lmao
lads got powers but this one dude dont. hes the main character
gummy told me u hate anime
nor have i had a mood swing
yeah ive watched heroaca. fell off with the latest season bc it didnt interest me but enjoyed it up to that
its pretty light on the moaning which is nice
the escalation from normal to weird is slow enough that if you watch the whole show it doesnt matter but if you skip pretty much any of it youll drown
i've made some mha oc concepts
real name: something japanese 
hero name: lord fafnir
quirk: transform into a massive fire breathing dragon, but is incapable of speech while transformed
age: 41
status: deceased
you rang
name a more iconic duo
so me
okay i found a quiz i wanna do
guys
e!crash -f
e!crash -f
alright
i just rolled two critical fails in a row in dnd
e!bot
i like how im maybe and drago is just a flat no
no he is nice
i have finalized the most important development in the history of let's plays
is it bad that i'm legitimately worried about the bunny dying before we finish the game? because the bunny's like 9 years old and the game is listed as 50 hours on hltb
i can't right now
so here is my latest commissionb
oh drago
is this true?
diego might
is diego even still in here?
cant you filter by event like "join / leave," "nick change," etc though?
joins and leaves don't appear
welp
it doesn’t
it circulated a while ago
e!bot
my log bot records all joins and leave
and they are not allowed to join voice call
we do
us being a pony server targets a lot of raiders
but this would be the first time he's uploaded since discord became a thing
ah yeah
and the last thing i want is sis being pissed off
you are either on her soft side or not
drago very simple, edgy 16 year old
thank god im usually her soft side
oh two more as well
banned 3 already
that messed them up
what did you think though?
i also dont think we have chick fil a
be super super nice to regulars or new nice people
want an ice cream sandwich?
that is wondeful
thought these are better
anyone living in wyoming
carbs and sugar in one meal
make trudeau buy the entire usa
mitch im disgusted
gummy is british and not canadian
everyone here is either left or close to left
it has to be a castle or palace
with*
but i wanted to make a joke about there being no dying in the pokemon world
make a joke
make a joke!
the original series brushed a lot through tbh
20% was not filler in johto
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
male feminists are basically people that support women or something
guys
that series has been running for 25 weeks and youre just now realizing that?
i had no time this morning to make breakfast
we dont have food
im in the library
yeah i don't get it either, but amd's tripled in the last three years so i probably shouldn't complain
see? new,
guys
im going to play so much of that gme
like if a pokemon you recruit faints then it gets unrecruited.... that was a bad change
twice
7 years ago
why do you have lewd art of your oc
hopefully it captures the charm of the originals well
is it incest though?
i assume you let it off in the woods on friday, let it bounce around randomly for two days and pick it up again on sunday
you just rapidly oscillate the muscles that contract and expand a limb. i can do that for short periods of time with my left arm before it starts hurting.
flubs eats food?
too bad see ya in heaven, loser
you seem to mellow down
cause flubs not gonna lie
do not answer that
what should i do then
these days it’s “thats gummy to you”
im trying to get flubs mad at me
fuck if i know
why do you want us to be mad at you
that doesn't mean i'm omniscient
i have no clue what that word means sis
but i was joking, no one can know everything
not the gob
i dont know that
not glob
but only for knowledge
im on my phone typing
trump is a literal stool sample
trump instills existential dread
i wish he'd go away, yeah
thats just worse democracy
napoleon didn’t do everything thing
what the heck i never knew he was a pervert
that's when things will get exciting
they don't represent the diversity of the country at all
so i'm not 100% sure if there were any winners in that debate
sis sleep
doesn't have alcohol
gummy thanks for dropping the animal crossing direct, i'm super excited for the game 😄
damn it sis
bringina, if you love your island, don't do it
no clue
best friends is a stupid concept
best friends exist?
mine abandoned me really dramatically, does that count?
idk that seems pretty dramatic
there is ice cream cake but im also hiding inside it. the abandonment was a ruse
ive always wondered if you could kill someone with a smoke bomb
<:ponkglock:644266129925341197>
well i can name a place or two thatd be better than others
which im currently not at
really confused about why the a button is only working in specific places though
flubs you break something
flubs
i got you a new pet
how sweet
rip my social life when animal crossing comes out that is if i can get it day 1
i know he would xd
where are you?
galarian transgender pokemon yessss
lol as long as it works that's all that matters to me
hasn't been a good week for cats it seems
it's one thing when you know a cat is old and nearing the end but this was just way too soon
wrong channel, whoops
omg lmao
my favorite part of the night was making gummy suffer with pokemon black and white
so more like not very surprising but also im a bystander watching all this drama go down and i can't help but find it the least bit amusing
make a youtube series about it
and yea pretty much, and i dont wanna have that shit spread lmao cos it just exposes how fucked my family situation is lol
how old are you sis?
<:mordredthink:561981371279605771>
well
headset advice
guys
it's a mix between snorlax and piplup
it's easy
what
i'm already yellow
thats the one
which are real words
remember when i said a broken clock is right twice a day? that applies to uberfacts as well
new plan
what you mean?
i think it looks interesting
and how dare my influence isn’t working?
animal crossing!!
so you have chosen.... death.
ah my food expert here
basically in simple terms: peanut butter, banana, and bacon milkshake
no demon lord
gummy where on earth did you even find that
magic drago
"always manage your textures properly. you don't want to end up like that guy, do you?"
guys
i just played games when my parents let me
sounds similar to me when i was 10ish
through naruto?
then i started to make accounts when i was 11ish
yes, through naruto fanfiction. "huh, naruto x sasuke... oh two guys can be together? thats new, okay"
because sis, why be ashamed of it? yeah it was stupid but if you think negative about it, it’s not gonna make you happy
that's a skill you should probably put on your resume or something
just ask bringina, im very careful around making sure what she also wants instead of it always being me
gummy is high wisdom low intelligence character u see
you rang
that makes no sense
psyduck is like pls help
i mean their trainer only wants it for the color of its skin of course it's uncomfortable
looks like meatballs
if that pizza had a little bit more cheese, i'd say that looks fantastic af
think im going through a mini midlife crisis
my life is been the same lately
though some animal crossing and pokemon are making my life less boring
and gummy, im sure you'll figure it out soon
out of how many he finished?
the world simply isn't ready for his epicness
yeah there's a few thaat haven't died from old age after the 80 years of waiting
tbh i hate studying
and this might be ego ish
as long as youre happy, that's all that matters
you would be correct on that 😂
it isn’t
i already doubt my ability to sleep
i been studying some of them sis
people tend to stream the new content
and that's not how it works
it sounds confusing
the crystal tower series is at level 50, unlocked after the credits roll
some crafting maybe
do dream together
i'm fairly cheap too
mario looks like a mexican - gummy
yes sis
~~wow she remembers~~
though i did promise nightshade an oc
i should actually get to work on that
fairly sure the 3600 actually draws less power than my current cpu too
get amd
oh god
and for real for both you and drago, prob hop around in the house then leave 5 mins after
a plushie of the pony oc made for me
or a sympathy discount
did you get banned again?
and it does imo
100% sure kiss ain't a skullkidfan thing prank cause she did a face reveal last night
i was told to add a crown
butter oil
butter is better imo
so turn the darn thing around halfway through
thats kinda just an issue. if you dont care about presentation or one half being too cold, you could always chop it at the divide and cook the bad end some more
fun thought experiment though
a broken clock usually just refers to one where the batteries died
1080p and hd?
sure why not
you mean dangaropa?
spider man 2
i remember that
jesus is real
hey my dad told me to do that
thats also rude
so then was the way of teaching the kids just the parents undermining what the other one says?
and climate change cant be real bc the earth isnt real
he tells me
because he said if they were, then why can't we see them
but says trump will crush them
me too
> and dinosaurs are made up
to be fair even the short ones
there have been people who made up dinos to become famous but those generally get uncovered as frauds and they're also violating dig site rules
i just read his status thing
im pretty sure mine is still one of the boss songs from ebf3
i don't think i would be against msnbc sacking him
too bad i don’t have cola sis
healthy
ohh my stomach
there are several possible responses i can think of this this conversation and they're all awful
im not sick to where i cannot work
besides new horizons, what should i get, i can only choose one. new super mario bros u deluxe, super mario maker 2, pokemon sword/shield, mario kart 8, pokemon mystery dungeon dx
nor mario maker
i don’t sadly
and there's an unlimited amount of it in mario maker
i definitely want it for collection
i say dx or sword and shield
dx and mario maker are highest
yeah mario maker is a much better value for money than new super mario bros. u
huh guess it's the alternative spelling so it was spelled right
also after watching a film
drago is main protagonist
i was the protagonist who stayed whole to nap
they still can't even pass the green new deal in congress let alone something like that
give the nation 7 more months
god why do we suck
bread and circus
no i think my dad is still enjoying it
gummy calm down at least you don't have an orange man who gropes woman as president
if russia ended i'd be pretty happy
references: am chinese
by ending
japan culture is better than america
just look at japan after world war ii and japan today
they need an emperor
i do believe shinzo abe is liberal
mitch that's like asking the people who cut gym class every day if they approve of gym class
i remember in 2016 when he dressed up as mario during the summer olympics closing cermony lol
i dare donald trump to do that
i would do that
one who accepts change
schutzstaffel office
since canada police arrested many today
imagine trump dressing up as mario lol
i have a feeling obama would have done that if you asked him nicely
i believe we had one in canada for a very short time
thats like the universal consensus drago
of course if he does win we'd continue to tradition of collecting one of every kind of president
some right is needed
i don't really see any point to the right
by doing things like, for example, actually doing things with peoples' immigration papers that don't involve filing the away for the rest of eternity
what are u gonna do cavity search everyone that comes in
borders would have done nothing to help
no the last major terrorist attack was by a white guy with an ar-15
what are those reasons?
pick a mass shooting, any mass shooting :(
crazy part is people would prob accept an american monarchy
jeff van drew: lemme switch parties because it would get me elected
just live in the pokemon center only problem is that's considered illegal
just left zeal
people in zeal gettin gyou down?
no gummy but there is massive game stores
i was pissed but not at anyone
the one thing he hasn't tried to actively dismantle
and those tax cuts trump passed have not in any way helped the middle class like he claims
god damn it now someone's going to have to destroy that also
because "don't be annoying" isn't a rule on the books, as you might have noticed
drago i will destroy your channel!
also drago
i went to catholic elementary and middle school, we had religion class
lets all move to errr
it was a public school with no religion
fuck
not gonna lie i totally cried during that phone call lol
true
i was mentioned
no, who is gummyv
alternately: sufficient, enough
so im used to their names from the cartoons
i don't think i would recommend doing it right now
do this to charlie
oh my god
i think i have a picture of charlie out and about in the snow just getting covered up
watch this one
the internet was a mistake
mitch it's not nice to dare people to kill themselves
ngl sometimes i do wish pokémon was still a small ("small") game made by a team of 30 people
ok so you're echoing me basically
it's a benedict cumberbatch photoshopped image i think
yeah its not like you play the games for the story
you knew i was pinning that, come on
...out the butt?
humans generally lay on their backs to make it more like a shit chair if anything
mitch i take it you've never conversed with flubs before
i was more saying that because kugal doesnt really need to know
shush mitch
because kugal does too many crimes
that's not an option, it has to be one or the other
me me m
he fuckin flipped it on me
not counting my wallet
ok fine
~~yes~~
get mitch to
kugal wanna talk about matrix multiplication?
so i know how to use it for 3d graphics and i know (kind of) how to do it, but i don't exactly see the actual connection between matrix math and 3d graphics
there you are
gummy i want that thing to burn, and when it's done burning i want the ashes to burn
gummy it's you versus literally the entire rest of the planet
only thing i'm prob gonna hate about sinnoh remakes is i'm gonna have to constantly look at what pokemon to catch to use as a hm slave lol
that is my plan to pick piplup as my starter and gummy is prob gonna mop the floor with me cause he felt like flexing that he's beaten the game 10 times lol
no both
i feel like the surf replacement in swsh should have killed the user instantly
i actually didn't except flubs to be the first person i ever met who agreed with me on hms, but hey
hey man i expected if people wanted to be horny theyd play zelda but a friend showed me some disturbing stuff recently that proved me wrong. they still play pokemon.
yikes!
on vhs
i always have to have one open whenever i do raids
also
itd be so easy to remember
someone prob has the brain of a math god while also knowing all the pokemon type advantages and disadvantages while also knowing how to speak a million languages
i mean i know all of th epoké.mon matchups, i just dont do the other things
bringina you have my full support on this mission
isnt rotom like every type or something
if it's not gonna be sanders the next best choice would have to be biden
biden has to win south carolina if he's gonna get that far though, not to mention super tuesday
is he the one where theres the audio file of him asking for pants with more dick room
mostly just boring stuff
give that audio a listen. really intriguing
actually i take back my statement on not viewing any of the conventions in 2016 cause i remember trump's current lawyer was pretty much hyping up the crowd
i gotta cuddle those cute bois
piplup is a bigger bitch though
i love birbs
can i buy drugs from you?
gummy let's meet up and eat some hot wings
a gummy and bringina destroying a country movie
um aggressiveness...
tom nook for president
the teacher of that class loves me, so her, my boyfriend, and like 5 other students came to defend me
the teacher told us to choose from the answer choices a or b
and then i said "ah yes, because c stands for 'can't create cool complicated conversations (with other students but sorry i couldn't come up with more words that start with c)'"
how dare you!
once it gets to 100k infected we can officially use this plagues inc style map
this virus reminds me of the black death
im in position
we only learned recently that rat fleas were the reason, didn't we?
they believe it started in china where rats would then infect traders who would trade with europeans
fuck
which would slow down the virus
hello my fellow gamer
see what happens
sis you are a nerd
idk who that is
our usa president everyone
is getting people to buy his bullshit
where we arent electing the president yet but doing all the setup for that
sis you are a noob
bring back the monarchy!
japan elections go by so quick your like nani
its all about theater here
although the usa doesn't really have an official one
last time people were lining up and walking to canada
i say let them all freeze
also my headset arrived today
can i trade myself in?
but i like sword
i meant june 2019
i don’t want the switch
and mitch
i’ll take flubs with me
yeah gummy cant stop time
i meant friday
no one knows what that means...?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
oh she is cute
damn it, she says don’t come to russia, but i always wanted to see the russian empire
yea pretty much
flubs no
yea agreed. however his justification for doing it that way was that he teaches like 6 courses a semester, and his hw pile is ginormous, and he's 60 and he's getting more tired as time rolls on
no come back i didnt mean it
but mitch
hey gummy are you looking forward to april fools day this year?
idk theyll probably announce it at e3 or something
oh seems like corphish is heading to e3
cause corphish
look at his motherboard
build it
i knew him when he had 55 and was annoying :p
lmfao, i'd totally do that proof though
im almost 20
i hate him for making me feel old
stop being almost 20
it definitely works like that
he doesn’t even need it now
i gotta add y'all on switch lol
yeah so are 320,000,000 other americans
same thing for vice president then?
and i feel like i heard there are different ways to make an rng so theyre all different
he's seeding the lottery with the social security number of the previous winner
see thing is a lot of americans wont understand that so it wont be implemented. new things have to be easy and similar to old things or they wont be liked
oh right
or even actual person
are you referring to ke- [drago has died of suicide by a bullet wound in the back of his head]
ash for president
though once again i don't take this family/sibling/twin thing seriously unless it's sis
and sis would be disappointed i bs an answer about icelandic canadians
and i have to take a canadian history
gummy what did you do
and i already hit puberty by that vid
i see
then the sinnoh fandom will be sad
why do you enjoy that episode so much then xd
i will burn you and the turtle
get me into this chat room
drago
i cant even tell if gummy is being serious or not at this point
but gums doesn’t wanna make mood bad
and he doesn’t want people to feel bad for him, cause thats bad
i love this show
i see
well that was a waste of time
usually the insults are worse
he can smite people at will but not viruses
sounds like an idea
austria*
italy it ww2 is just sad, austria was jerks i thinj
ww2 bad
also had black racism issues as well
i mean ww1 was bound to happened because tensions
i like this music
buuny needs his happy meal
but at 6 am
i can't sleep because i'm in pain
drop things?
i'm sipping some tea rn
pokemon moon is helping me a bit with ptsd and my mid life crisis
i mean all i do is go to work, school, home and repeat
after 3-4 years drago
too bad i don’t have the vids anymore
gummy you have an interetsing concept of "effort"
<a:pawnk:680050332889645108>
it's about robot butts with a side of post-human existential dread and light hack-and-slash mechanics
i don’t like butts
nier automata is about butts
sylveon is bad and should feel bad
if anyone meaning prob just demon lord wondering about stream
pokemon has been cancelled due to bringina feeling a bit ill
shut the fuck up
cause fnatic
yeah
her husband came after me
i see
the consequences without the fun
won't be there today, this has been a week from hell and i just need it to be over
cheap
don’t waste money
i should get one for my father so he can stop playing ps4 and screaming at cod lol
1990: kids screaming at the video games
good
he even said that this is his 10 times saying that
oh nice
so once they run out of kat capture cards
brb trying something on kelly
he speaks javascript
you're giving me hilarious powers drago
gummy your traffic lights are tilted
and im at work so im not texting and driving
good gummy
they're fun if you're the one wielding them
never dealth with ruby either
and then i used it for two pokémon fan games and slightly-less-than-hated it
a darn book
your life is to be around gummy like everyone else
cause gums has no life
can probably pilfer textures from existing things though
also brb
also that new guy in zeal has died already, no surprise there
how long do you recommend
and then learning shit through days at his office
whats the lowest i can invest?
how many men must fail for every buffet to succeed
it's also going to be in free fall for a little while, so don't buy anything now
good answer kugal cant have them knowing about our dish sessions
or left politics?
i am
me too
im an adult
and it'll be awkward
she is a bitch
oh it’s a she
my bf and i are in a server with her and she always makes us feel bad for interacting together because we're forcing others to "third wheel" yet when she interacts with her bf in there it's 100% fine
ah, double standards
it's never a good idea mentally to wait if someone is getting to you, i realize it may be awkward at grad but you gotta think about you're feeling right now
i think i will
i will do this 100%
fuck yeah
delightful person
gasp
i left zeal
seems like gumland makes you happy then
this server, though i cant talk here a much, still makes me super happy
okay i feel like shit after that chug
cause gums smart with server
im pretty sure people enjoy the political talk and news
politics is just a great source of entertainment
i am a monarchist, thats no joke
you can go by the form in the channel description or you can go through the full 100 axis
it should take mayb half an hour
how far did you get?
i think my favorite things so far was learning about linear independence and invertible matrices, and theorems for determinants
which makes a lot of sense
i love partial derivatives
have you got to the chain rule yet with partial derivatives?
here are my gay and my crimes sorry for how long it is :\(
no master
alright?
i am a god in a world of ants
therefore in spite of the contrary contrapositive cross product i must denounce this line of reasoning
the great thing is that when chaos comes everyone thinks they'll be the king on top and welcome it for that
i will start a diamond and pearl walkthrough
wonder how long it would take u to finish x or y in a day
i have pirate diamond which is bad
wait you can watch me
i want to save platinum for bringy and me
the store used to be less horny
yeah but not in this sad of a manner jesus christ
join the lonely gang. horny gang is stupid
im alone a lot but i feel surrounded by lovely people
save some of it for the rest of us jeez
i didnt realize other people got to weigh in on that
but i think thats against the rules
see that was always my theory about heaven
yes sis, right away sis
sis why are you up?!
fuck
do homework early?
at 4:45
this is amazing
here is my friend's doggo again, riley, cosplaying as a bun
well i do have an exam starting in 7 hours
oh fuck
i knew it was fake
then we would know your full name lol
yeah i sent it when i said u should do a pokemon spicy food challenge and what inspired me to propose the challenge lol
in other news i'm currently having existential dread over bloomberg seeing any level of success at all
also even though i lean left, i don't like bernie sanders and while he would definitely be better than trump, i don't think he deserves to be president
ida when i say young i mean "not my grandma's age"
willingly
bloomberg might be the worse one nvm
i think most people would
i'm curious to see how nuts the republican party will be in terms of elect choices in 2024
i mean in terms of running cause he may want to after trying in 16
yes sis...
you and god must have some connection
i know
i did something stupid
now im sitting in pain
walmart is whatever though
co worker died
i liked pete until he started roasting people for no reason
but i wanna see him rap the usa problems away
it turns out there's more stuff for him to destroy than he thought
i don't see trump changing vice presidents
the only woman to hold office in canada is crazy as fuck
regardless if it's biden or sanders, i think they would be smart to pick kamala harris
that's my hope anyway
and in bernie's case it may be good for him to have a more moderate running mate
i guess punch, not kick. but you get the spirit
e!bot
e!bot
because it's 7:46 pm
glad i could help :\)
im not quite sure im still trying to figure that out
or imaginary
they should just give it back to cartoon network
he destroyed them. oh god
drago, how?
wait i wanna hear lewd joke
we should probably stop talking about skarm now
what if youre the new guy?
how the fuck do they poo
i'd rather have someone who can beat trump than someone who agrees with me
it's pretty much biden vs sanders not sure why warren is still going but ok
more training is needed
that
i don't think putin can run next election
theyre the bits inside the dangly thing beneath the dong
science!
because i do
dragonitespam vs supergummying
charlie would lose
mustton not now
i’ll get back in the swing of that game once i get my life in check
was there anything _not_ wrong with supergummying?
flubs ask drago
first off, the one you'll come to know during your travels around limsa lominsa
y'shtola rhul
smart and sassy, big fan favorite
next up, the one drago may have encountered
papalymo's the brains of the duo, yda's the ditz who can punch stuff well
balloons?
that animal thing sis
it's
that's its pom
i don't think we do though
i finally did it
there's these stages called the coils of bahamut that are split into 3 parts
are you calling me slow?!
epic
i feel like they will
or are those not out yet?
ngl i'm probably top three in the list of eyan twitch regulars of all time
thats fuckin crazy
but man the forums changed a lot
to be fair ash rained hell there too
and they did get in here
i'm curious to see who she's gonna endorse
it's just nuts that the most diverse list of candidates now boils down to two old white men
they worry the young will party and do nothing
obama
people
hot coffee it is
no becasue you're incompetent
lgbtq rights even though canada already has that
so bernie
i am against it but i don't give a fuck about what you do
i do believe biden wants the 15 dollar wage
reduce greenhouse gases
as for international stuff
america
this
i fucked up
argo my sister and i have began adapting that song to be about our dog
basically my me as my oc, and well what do you guys think?
that was decisive
remember the days when you had to wait months for a game to be localized from japanese to english?
guys
which is better?
argh
it's not embarrassing
cause it was only my gameplay
that is so me
what you think sis?
look at then
how dare you call her creepy
i have been officially offered and accepted part time permanently at my workplace!!!
fuck that
nice work gums!
idk how you haven’t left gumland left
it’s ponies
if that
tbh it’s been less ponies lately since show ended
also how to properly ignore you without letting on that im ignoring you
back in zeal server you were there when 20 people talked
yeah but i dont like vc as much since i cant talk
now ive got hobbies and stuff. reading, putting blood in my system from my bones, that stuff
i want in on the blood hobby
start of original skype group
i do respect you guys will call me out on my shit
fuck i don’t remember how to spell it
i used to be like that
im not smart enough to know if thats healthy or not but my gut says no
im gummy not eric
bringy
i think its more common to not be that different online. im just weird
for the rest of you...
yeah but itd be violent
every time he talks it just brightens your day, y'know?
but let's playing is kind of dying anyway so yeah
demon lord let's plays aren't going to die until i say they can die
it'll be like vods but maybe a bit more compressed or something
drago^. 5
this is why nerds have the best jokes
hence its racist
and you get this
i get it
it’s not that hard
doesn't have to be anything too fancy
would be uploading
same sis
yeah i don't blame you there
also probably making camelot/gummyland may have made the other community harder...
the secret to success in zeal server is have that one active person
flubs
gummy is roughly equal to one $60 video game
i could send him a horse head in the mail as a threat
which flubs
for some weird reason i find his commentary relaxing
also mitch i can vc you soon
man i gotta go from over here to click on the stream and pause the thing im doin and then stay engaged bc i like talkin and blah blah blah
you are lazy
>  i'm still binging drago's sun and moon let's play lol
why lol
because you said my stream was good
"awoo" -charlie, when asked about his thoughts on gummy
take a video and ask him
wait he disappeared?
he's probably outside sleepin on his bed
it sucks and i hate it
i know you all don’t watch my streams  but is it bad or good that i keep a stormy profile pic somewhere on the overlay?
thanks guys
im trying to promote bacon
early morning roast
i would forget an email and password after 1 hour?
there is now a third hand sticking out of my butt
maybe
is corona that bad in australia
i could make a few different jokes about having a third hand sticking out of my butt and they're all in varying degrees of poor taste
theyre just watching us from on high, mocking us mortals for making such a spectacular mess of everything
something something prismo something something monkeys paw
alright kiddos
my thing? mens' fashion
ie suits
i give you a b-
thanks teacher drago
but when hes home he prolly wont be
guys
but i did all i can and i only slept a few hours
flubs you don’t even go out to eat
and so i will
10:30
sylveon is number 6
man im an adult ive got responsibilities and jobs
(original plan was for them to take turns but he ended up playing the whole thing)
also seems like he is now a streamer
i watched a few of her vids as well
though im getting tired of mcdonalds
and my health ain't good for deep fry stuff all the time
also flubs
and don't be like drago and say it sucks and i hate it
it sucks and i love it
flubs your taste is the shit
only complaint is that there was only 1 flubs in chat and thats not really on you
well flubs
i might get it and stream it
i have never seen a leader do that before
fuck you twitter
guys i just figured something out
i kinda just wanted to meme a bit
exactly lol
no one saw
and if you have no clue why lately i been thinking about youtube and twitch is ever since i got that last supergummying channel banned, i been watching my old vids again
okay
i dont understand but i appreciate it
i only have one sis!!!
seriously
i don’t know...
lets just forget all of that sis
(i have the game though)
but wait
don't get my advice on a speech
scream animal crossing and promote my social media
try not to be nervous
unless if there'd be like
brother im workin
take a guess
and it ain’t animal crossing either
i feel like i don't know the switch's library well enough
same tbh
mario bros. u
yoshi's crafted world i believe
i really liked watching chugga first luigi mansion
also im not bringing back “what’s up kiddies”
don't be like spongebob
this streaming is fun
that doesn't even make any sense
demon lord lets plays arent allowed to die until i say they can die
sis he was like one of my only friends back then
yeahh “friends”
and then skip a few years i only mostly listen to sis
what do you mean by that though?
it took me months to warm up to flubs
even though mccann scared away many viewers
wooo
and has the power to make good chnages
we had a vote
iirc i didn't accept until cuddles told me to go ahead
as you can see, she was the wise of the two of us
back then he hated people making games
i think schools in indianapolis have closed
nah sis
i like him but imma try to avoid his bad gambling addiction in the future
i have never
with meat and vegetables in it
because i wanna play with it? i thought you guys know me well at this point
i would have beaten drago
and then there was the regularly bad one
and then my current one is sub-par
but i have some ranch left over
gamestop has been gunning hard for stuff that can't be sold digitally lately
ooo bringy
so basically the only social media i have is the gummy twitter
facebook sucks
hoenn
like x and y?
it was
gen 7 is really good
when you are playing it feels like it's going pretty fast
gen 8 is a mess
is slow
~~yeah because even mitch can beat it~~
i once saw somebody say if they enjoy gen 8 then they aren't a true pokemon fan because real fans would boycott the games lol
i changed my mind, pokémon should die so that all these awful people are forced to go do something else with their lives
gummy now has to come out of the closet
she is great
you are no lord
how awesome
that sounds like rabbits are made of quite a few indigestible decomposing biochemicals
does that change actually do anything
whaaat
and apparently he claim in an interview
he made a great movie
guys
he started youtube like in 2014/2015 and made meme vids and other things and he was super hyper and shit
people make it look easy to get subs
i killed 15
oh my god
come on, you know i had to look for the pony version
i love the fact they chose rules of rarity
>why was i the only one who failed
bringy told me this and i think sis told me this before
lmao
bella stop being my friend in 2016 so i deleted my account
i made a 3ds pokémon hacking video in 2016 that randomly started being relevant in february
preparing switch streams won’t be easy
it's probably too late for this year, i'd take like 8 months to render
wrong
i swear imma punch this girl in my class
her smile annoys me
guys
wait that's you?
hes fucking op
drago how the fuck does ash have gengar and a dragonite
because ash is a god ever since winning the league lol
the man is fucking op
and lost hard
this is new
apparently his dragonite hugs him a lot
if ash wins i'll donate $50 to you gummy
so hes motivated now
the stakes have been raised
tempting
ep 16
let's say win the league
if i can binge watch at the end of hoenn
you won't make it
tbh it would be neat to watch sun and moon with you and bringy
~~wonder why you aren't watching unova hmmmmm~~
already seen ti
how come wow
no...
someone posted a slavery meme
and batmans have nipples
like this
what is pokemon?
wait
what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object
sleep early
says the person who wants to do their own pokemon binge
since everyone here is nice
i wonder would you get banned from discord if you posted straight up porn?
yeah
yeah
which was good
safe tags
\||do this  \||
when you post the image click the spoiler option
there
||dawn is best girl||
fuck no
cause knowing bunni and flubs
i have a feeling it's going to end up with <#542191633391681556> as high-quality shitposting and <#677000135552532500> as low-quality shitposting
i fucking let tenda talk about like collars and shit in gummyland the other day
and other lewd things
why not just call it safe for shitposts
there
that's a better name
tbh we barely use any of the channels here outside of this one
frickin
much better
close enough
i think i ran into ida in summer 2014 or so but it might have been 2015
good memories back then
in zeal server?
not even drago figured me out fast

no lol
that would put you somewhere around 11 am on december 30
it is safe to post
i like bossing people around
put that on dev
there's a hsv to rgb equation that i dont remember off the top of my head
and he doesn't bother to talk to me!
jk jk
probably helped that eyan was streaming in the afternoon
i think the manechat split changed a lot
now to post rarity pic again
now where was i?
trump is huffing and puffing
winning the hurt game what did u do
i believe it was
nope
i heard they were going to close events to the public but good lord
i wonder if baseball season's going to go the same way
lets hope they don’t cancel lol esports
online or in person?
make of this what you will
that was last week
i'm honestly freaking out
hmmm
if it did that, i have a feeling we'll know prettg quickly
those two arent one and the same, but high propagation can lead to higher mortality rate due to cases overflowing the healthcare infrastructure and having more hosts for a chance to mutate from
i love the chicken video
that was one funny outtake
no joke
oh a character
mean to gym leader
im a little worried
thanks gummy love you
i mean you did call me a fat kid 4 minutes ago but sure
i didn't i was talking about something else 😦
another friend took it and is now at a middle d, after getting 37%
right exactly
ultra sun never fails to trigger me
guys
also my prime minister wife has a fever and may have gotten the virus
how am i crazy?
remember i also work in a gun store as well
because they all had something special
it was only until...
after the whole bella mess that my personality shifted to an “i don’t care what you guys do”
just because other people are crazier doesn't mean you're not crazy
or anything that is muzzleloading
better not touch na lol esports
wonder how mad canadians are
i would expect esports to take a bit
the lol world championships this year are hosted in china
and ace attorney
well then ill just play it myself, who knows when capcom finally announces aa7
also
dad got back from work
i learnt leadership from medieval era
medieval stuff is cool
flubs ain’t happy
give me
mouth masks aren't great because your eyes are also an entry point. full face masks work better but usually run on filters that cost $80 and last 24 hours
might just be a different country thing then
for you did people with glasses not need any goggles at all?
yes that is what i meant, maybe my wording was off
air is for losers
biochemistry needs gloves much more than goggles anyway. people in analytics course might be usin them for some specific classes tho, if i had to hazard a guess
you are not kirby
bringy, i was a smart teenager
a kid at my high school was doing a demo in physics where you put water on a glass plate and whip it around in a circle
gummy is fiction
she talks like a robot
new estimated delivery date:
thursday, march 19, 2020 - wednesday, march 25, 2020
you are bad at knowing the leaders
draw bacon
it's my current twitter banner
i'm waiting for news to come out saying trump has corona because it wouldn't be a shock at this point when he came in contact with the brazil president
yes he prob would
this entire pandemic will be trump's downfall in november because it's a common thing in history where the current president in a crisis usually gets voted out in the coming election
that's the messed up part there are people that still support him it makes me sick
dunning-krueger effect, i think
hes incompetent
will there be a carbon tax?
i'd rather be under canadian consveratives
you sure about that?
i feel like
yeah i should be safe
i just worry because of this morning when saskatoon said they had their first case
only problem im gonna have is getting to my office in the city
the governor declared a state of emergency
granted, i doubt "slowing the spread" is going to even put a dent in the load on the hospital system, considering that a lot of them are already bursting at the seams even during non-virus times
yeah it helps but i got a job man
what's good for the corporations is good for the people, obviously
and anything good for me is good for anyone else
seems like my next con may not happen then...
ye i dont recommend goin there evwn if it were to happen
i'm probably gonna skip going home for easter or for my siblings' birthday
yeah that's why i shared this here specifically
because its a virus, isnt it gonna mutate and shit?
what makes it boring
why?
then we move on the switch briefly
you won't be the only one
so i prob won't take a day off
arriving 19 mar - 25 mar
this is treason!!1
lol i mean unless you want to sit in your room and play fortnite all day getting partnered is not really achievable
just have a decent following and active, you can email them
blitz
i don't think my banner who bringina will draw will be done
um demon lord, im trying to look like a pro here, not a child
<:stpc_ppyum:480683453071884318>
because he isn't afraid
insert italian joke here
riots all over the place
...not that im in the mafia
watch this clip if you can of new new spongebob
it's nice to see them with a more fleshed out personality
"you can kill me, but you'll never find the sarin gas canister i placed in the president's fridge. shit."
there's way better reasons than that to kill amazon
it's owned by a dirtbag, for one
"i'm sorry to know that your pre order item that is to be delivered today has not shipped yet. please do not worry, i'll check the details and try my best to help you."
i hate that guy
i am gonna burn all of amazon down
i take back everything i just said
i like these people for getting me free shit
still, its standard
my pleasure
gen 7 just hates me for whatever reason
that's what i've told him
i never said that
i think it's funny and bad
i mean you always gotta call one candidate a communist and of them all, sanders is the communistist
like i said
the world should have stayed like monarchy
yeah
i also believe in equity
i need to clean everywhere
xi is a robot, change my mind
like with detergent or something
it's easy to clean just by being in the shower
toilet paper doesn't work just use wet wipes or shower
if you can see through the paper it might as well not be there
so i gave her more than what she expected
not that you were a nazi and bad at hiding it, that you were actually hitler
im pretty sure i acted nothing like a nazi back then, and im pretty sure i still don’t act like one to this day
and said $480.55 has been charged on it
with the coronavirus
they need it for bathroom breaks
it happened here as well
i've been
maybe it’s the virus?
you have a time limit and they say the basic things that i already know
i think so
thanks both
being around family will always lighten the mood
your brothers prob miss you, and well from what you told me, i don’t think the virus will be an issue
i think im one of the few people though that can’t be around family that long cause fights breakout
gummy you have the ability to make your little sister immediately vacate the room? god i wish i could do that
wait
and still drive more
i need like at least 2 days of rest before making the return trip
could you
at this point im literally used to it
e!google ecs
i'd like to make those basically anonymous functions
at least trudeau actually cares about the people
trump said once neo nazis and people defending against them had good people on both sides
and the fact that he admitted there may have been fine people on the "not literal nazi" side is pretty good, on his standards
i want this man as president
jean-christophe
dunno
daily streaming hasn’t been going well since i took a tiny break on thursday
hello blitzypoo
it uh, did not go well
<#580946892201000960>
well you've got six days
i hear eyan wants to play animal crossing
yes....they replaced the mlp show
but it’s cute
yeah something like that
i don't really care
oh yoiu mean a different welcome message for each guild
so instead of this
recursion is limited to 2000 characters
wait is bot not a global const?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
was it?
what can bot actually do?
actually now that i think about it
interesting
i'll do that after i get the existing ones up and running in the new format
yeah i guess
i keep thinking im sis with my profile pic
oh her!!
out of all the games you showed me, it’s my fave
im currently team flare aliana
none of them have eyes
why does that guy look like a lion
why cant pokemon characters look normal
like why cant the champion just be some person who wears pants and a shirt? why they all gotta have wings and lion hair
this is my favourite champion
objectively wrong
and thatd be sick
if biden is elected we would prob have an obama coalition again
id take any obama as vp really
i think it's likely his running mate will end up taking over the ticket in 2024 assuming he wins
ive read reports hillary could be a vp
...could he make trump his running mate?
im not saying he should or would im just wondering if its allowed
nah i think that was before he was speaker
he's gonna be too old to run for a second term
cool
first rule as vp, no white house!
the more gothic and mysterious
this actually can represent me well
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
so the extreme right guy and me agreed on some things...
but then we found something we didn’t agree on
all prisoners should be executed for population control
dear god
don’t care if they are innocent or the crime
we must kill some innocent for population control
i hope so
he’s not trolling
he’s an old guy
he's messed up in the head
if you had the views of kim running for pm in canada i would cut ties with you and leave
however
ironic that it's called the people's party when most of the people apparently have far right views
he’s trying to get me to move to the right
but we will see
he says sanders is communist
though he doesn’t think biden is mafia
whats going on tonight?
> my dad also believes kim jong un should run canada
they are central
ndp and green are left
like where they say men shouldn’t exist
and air pollution
i don’t fully support them, thats a difference
he isnt one to lie
then again, sis doesn’t want a cool castle
i think
when i get back on final fate
thats not fair or true mitch
yall talk too dang much
he takes the blame for the good stuff
gummy i could literally push you over and you wouldnt be able to do anything about it
you said creative costume, huh
no screw off, bot
i believe he told me it was alabama
one of you guys told me i had cancer cause a cat sniff me
i had a dream that i drove my mom's van through the wall of the house once
canada or at least here has a lot of young conservatives
wtf why does everyone wanna separate from canada
mitch imma tell you something surprising
it wasn’t that mitch
that was the issue
he tax people on gas to help stop climate change but did the opposite with that
that's just like when my cat could detect cancer in my mom before she was even diagnosed
that's a good man right there
i go back to my argument saying people can hate politicians all they want but it's a needed qualification
i think the thing with pollution
is to really shut down anyone dumping waste in the ocean
same
i saw plastic bags flying everywhere
difference is
a musket can shoot down like one person a minute, if you get lucky with your aim and don't get interrupted reloading
instead of jail
this would stress me out a lot
what you guys think?
also yes...i would probably wanna build a gothic castle for myself. i like to make it represent me
i also kept other things we have talked about
what about boris johnson
where everything is now circle
thats my new channel
~~who said it was your channel~~
im not crazy im deranged
mine is better!!
also you'd have to actually play the game
then i can play
everyone
is that the one i used viner hand itc all over the place
flubs do i sound more or less nasally in your head
ive heard the voice but its gone man
nightshade sounds german?
idk she sounds kinda american to me almost
according to you i sound depressed so i dont trust you gummy
gummy if you didnt already not trust uberfacts as a source, theyre either terrorists or liars
sometimes we stay away from the things we like because they suck. uberfacts is worse than meth
and even if its true what does that even mean
he misses flubs
not today though because i killed my voice already
guys
and mitch, trudeau won’t annex usa
i would have fucking believed it
cnn?!
then you have parents threaten to bring students to teachers if schools closed down
it was all just stuff you had learned already, completely pointless
lpt: never call something a "literacy test" its got a nasty past
no we did, that was just an extra requirement you had to do
because everyone's related
lets go back to this youtube business
alright new supergummying channel
the last time i told bringy this joke, she used a squirt bottle of me
a squirt bottle
americans are the least prepared
never thought i would ever see canada close borders
thatd be good. no more canada
flubs
that makes sense actually
don't compare me to that movie
as long as my head doesnt get used as a arm rest by taller person again im good
rat attack
but tune in tomorrow maybe?? for pokemon finale
the rat
oh sis, i got this toy
i think i know why i like playing with toys, it’s my happy spot in brain
my little sis and me are at our worse today in terms of insult
he called it the "chinese virus"
im scared to cough in public cause i don’t wanna start a public meltdown
no sis..but i tend to chew on a lot of things
he's old, i bet she could make it look like an accident
yeah politicians have been pointing their guns at end-to-end for ages now
so thats why the cs people want cs courses in k-12
i already threw two temper tantrums at amazon
you will with an alligator
they don't give a shit
good luck drago
because i am preparing to call amazon
you don't get it here in america if you are poor and can't pay taxes you are punished but if you are swimming in cash they don't care if you don't pay
we all know trump doesn't unless it seems so because he doesn't want to release his tax returns
saying you wear it for ceremonies
it was a business trip not a vacation
good news
that's good
i should cancel switch
and buy a normal one
would think gamestop would restock them when the game comes out
like they told me...
i should have bought switch at chick fil a
lol i'm ever gonna beat gen 7
its too late for that to work now
itai no wa iya nano de bougyoryoku ni kyokufuri shitai to omoimasu 
is the japanese name, the translated one is also stupidly long and i don't have that in front of me rn
well that wasn't very nice of her
congrats
stormy would hate me if she saw i suggested that
she would love it
something about the eues
i'm amazed gummy was able to beat him because he is literally impossible
well it did take like 40 minutes and four attempts even with two people so...
i've attempted it twice and haven't gotten one attack off
.....
hey at least i didn't ignore pokemon refresh
i am very happy my first true series on stream is done
you should be a pokemon boobie streamer xd
animal crossing doesn't count
will be either platinum or danganronpa
danganronpa 2 has a russian roulette scene
don't read the comments, spoilers
sis, permission to burn jeff guy who owns amazon?
ditto
dont listen to her gummy you dont need a good reason to set someone on fire
and anywhere you are is a good place to go if you want to practice social distancing
agreed
i never thought i would say this but i think biden has a legit shot at beating trump given the virus situation or if anything it would be a very close race
if bernie loses arizona i won't be stunned if he suspends
i'd expect a suspension from campaign between 1500-1800 delegates, but they may go until the bitter end if the desire of the people is seen as more valuable than unification behind the abstract of a party
what is wrong with you like give me a break
just looked biden won
join!!!
im playing destiny 😦
join and listen while playing?
i dont appreciate it
how about in an hour?
probably actually
our units are cooler because one of them is named after a part of the body
the only good imperial units are liquid measure
your regularly scheduled cynicism will resume shortly
10% of the followers are friends, the rest are random
so, yeah
streaming in the afternoon is the best
well no!
and i bought my capture card and everything
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
i don't have a switch at all
i think i managed to get up to 40 followers on twitch and like . . . 35 of them were friends
i meant your wii u and whatever
wii u is sold
maybe you have one that can take the funny tv cables that the wii uses
so maybe i should order another one just in case it blows up on me
maybe i should order one
oikay
it's part of a fan-made mod
you have to press start, select, l and r right before the poké ball shakes for the third time
that resets the game
no it doesnt shut up
dammit stormy
what no i meant for the ability to throw poké balls
or was it hg
pokepark is kinda meh, i think the first game was better than second
what the frig is pokepark
think it's a troll article
guys
that just seems like a bad business decision
too bad you weren’t close by, i wouldn’t mind letting you borrow mine
fun fact, i don’t want to be a teacher or go to uni but i have no choice
i do want to be an author
yeah
btw guys
oh congrats!
it's very bad in italy apparently hospitals are failing and 300 are dying a day
lubs
thought you wouldn't move for another few years
we now have 9k corona cases in america
but i'll miss you flubs
the number has been rising hour by hour
gummy you being mad at something isnt anything new
oh my
get demon lord to do one
you should watch that funny vid
here
this is blessed
my pleasure
okay so switch is coming either tomorrow or monday
also i take it with the no replies from earlier
gummy is everywhere
i mean yes
because i never say anything about him thats chill
okay i can feel the tension in the store im at
i thought steam left it bleeding in the moonlight
they're actually doubling down on physical goods like headsets and stuff
oh thats a fair move
by 2025 they'll probably change their company name to funko-pop stop
yes but actually no
or alternatively, bestbest buy
gums wants to stream but he can't
btestesb buy
and calculus tells imaginary numbers to take a hike most of the time and sticks to being operable in r^n
that's not a cad lady
why does sis get all those fancy looking clothes
mine looks basic
not the same one as the kitty
..whats my password again?
i am supposed to for a quest
not that far
are you following me?
despite the npc and quest telling you to do so
i thought i did?
upper section
i was reading an email okay
did you get an error message saying you were currently wearing the best equipment?
it says gears for an arcanist equipped
ignore all the crap i have in mine, that's just how it looks
i'm making some stuff for you
~~but you are so i'll just have you do everything for me instead~~
i've finished the body and legs
it's like someone cut karna in half and stuck rarity's head on
no it's the fact that you're on a trial character
wait am
i have no idea
it's because you need two to learn it
this guy
so i went somewhere
well if you don't already have the same one, yes
yay i teleported
where?
oh my
omg im so cuteeee but not a fan of the shoes
oh okay
which is basically me
70% of bronycon info was hidden from them and even if there were no deaths, it would have still been hidden
anyways
gummy do you need a hug
no thanks
i’ll have my shitty laptop
but even if i have switch
i wanted to stream animal crossing
if not...then i won’t stream the first few days
i need to talk to someone about something stupid everyday
who else do we know...
it is
but see we killed all the big ones already and we kept the little ones as pets to minimze the threat while keeping the weak as a token of conquest
i accidentally punched my cat in the face
watch your back
i have failed as an animal person 💔
i have 6 other people in this house
i can make it all ritual-like
i decides to stop at walmart to look at toys
hey transformers are my life
i should have realized sooner since it clearly said made in china on the back
completely forget which
it was an accident she jumped onto my desk as i was reaching for my controller t.t
also the second nightshade appears the lurkers come out
wait i'm sorry
or was plotting my death
awww
she is trying to trick you into thinking you are forgiven then she will wait until u sleep
well you see i pinged animal man to provide nightshade with a course of righting her wrongs
cause sis owns it flubs
id be a fair and honest dictator who ruled purely through terror
oh you corrected it
unless sis says no
also what did i miss?
and don’t tell me to re read msgs
...what?
oh boy
so true?
i mean i have it, im not very clear
like i said animal crossing doesn't have a lot of things to do at this point
since i done most of the thigns
who?
im more impressed that there is a hashtag thanking him lol
im scared
greater than or less then in complex numbers aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
i haven't seen news of people calling up gun stores
and maybe a gun myself
i don't think you having a gun is a good idea
that was beto o rourke's downfall
better yet can the uk just take us back to their country
we sold about $30,000 in bullets today
im at high risk tomorrow
too much red
6am = best time
yeah but minus four hours
i have exactly 1 other morning bird in my life 💔
meee...monday when i get my switch
we do have midges, though
tiny flies that go around in clouds
gummy are you on quarantine or something after today?
i been hearing the same thing happen in california
but can you over a ukrainian accent?
usually im not around fixes that
but not today
i won’t be able to stream this week
no drago, the issue is my parents want me back at my hometown and not the city
"hello everyone, i'm here to substitute stream for gummy. now, the situation calls for me to use thunderbolt on this gyarados, but i need to stay in-character so we'll have gummy using surf on it instead"
spoiler: yes
wow thats a lot higher than i expected
but...she’s been afk all day
she knows you got a switch and is hiding
bringy would never hide from me
no but you act like one
hmmm
too bad the other girl is anti greta
she has this pokemon as her signature one
shes the one in the windmill place?
platinum is good but its too darn slow
gen 2...clair??
even though she talked like a robot
gen 4 would be mars and jupiter
i think thats how you spell her name
gummy why are they all wearing off-brand google glass
also ida cynthia's a history nerd and she has hair partially covering one eye, come on
it’s not confirmed but hinted a bit that the blue and purple hair girls were crushed to death
that is fucked up
team rocket trap those two in a net in their building
platinum or x and y
why are you starting with new horizons
not entirely sure why, but new leaf just didn't do it for me
pretty sure i scratched the screen
i might be a failed version of eyan on youtube and drago is a budget version of chugga
i don’t give a fuck if i have 0 viewers
now don’t tell me that it doesn’t have alcohol in it
i was joking sis
i just wanted someone to point it out and i would throw a funny tantrum
but nintendo's site said it does not come with one and only the black one has it
dying and being declared dead are different
2020 is not better! take that twitter
surprisingly similar to youtube but i don't find it awful for once
the memes from this year have been intense and immersive so far. gotta give it a solid 9/10 thriller rating so far
i still have the logs
im making alcohol
alright i feel bad for that
but one wants sour cream, which i don't wanna use
isnt buttermilk on its own really sour?
i can make enough for everybody xd
not anymore
why would you compare the two
prof looked at my midterm and said looks like i aced it, or at least "very close to"
yall are fucking barbarians
that's okay because the queen's got at least another 50 years ahead of her
is he the one that was at the epstein island all the time
that was prince andrew
i want this comic so badly
thats such a strange tweet
the root-level replies are usually good
>so happy he can't speak
i want sis as president
[vomits all over the presidents of the united states posters in middle schools all across the country]
am i the only one who thinks bernie should just suspend due to the primary being over pretty much
here is the source
not that i think mcdonalds actually has good food, but jesus christ
theyre pretty much saying that people arent allowed to take sick days
anyways
you can have the little bit that's under the fork though
yummy
but i have issues consuming most sweets
sorry nightshade but i gotta destroy your house\
that's illegal
it was working out just fine until corona showed up
now this is stressful
why didn't you bring your stream setup with you?
but yeah that all made sense
then realized bringina and me would have so much meme material
so i guess you're not able to just make another profile on your switch and have a separate town on that one right?
this is what i will do to my hr person
i personally asked saturday off
i didn't know you could do that
yikes you live in new york hope you are staying safe
im a couple days behind people in animal crossing
gummy will time travel after all
well maybe...
also napoleon was in charge of elba before he left so this works sooo well
gummy you should make your character look like this:
i got the special animal crossing switch
gummy has just realized the joycons have batteries
you guys are saying these guys are hard to catch
i thought those were scratches
i don't remember ever seeing residue on mine
how am i going to survive until may 29
bravely default two
god i wish i could use a switch
yes there was an ordeal involving gamestop with xenoblade
i was fortunate enough to get a sealed copy on the wii for just $60 a couple years back
gummy internet will get better once he’s back to his territory
i can’t believe i complained to amazon last night when it turns out my switch ain’t damaged
apparently you are the only person that didn't know they need charged
so i assume the screen needed charging
ugh my sister’s tent is pissing me off
when she plays
and upgrade
curse you mall
and it's not stacy's mom, it's even worse than that
one moment
who the fuck is dan
oh thank god i can say no
though as much as i like this switch thing
xbox
wii u
oh demon lord
yeah lol
i like how that's the mai  factor in how you decide that was worthwhile
mai factor?
well
and he has said stupid things before
people keep electing stupid people
we have two to pick from
both are rapist
we shouldn't have to vote for a freaking party leader
and i believe biden also touch children?
he would make the same mistakes as trump and get impeached like trump
and the cycle will continue
if only you didn't have to be born in america to run for president
well classmates and teachers also make a major impact
bad and good sis because some classmates (mine) involved drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol
i remind her a month after
permission to punch her?
got 100% on my linear algebra midterm 2! yus
i felt so confident on that bitch
i remember first time going through the exam, before i went and rewent through all the problems to check my work
nightshade my #1 error with matrix algebra is missing a sign on accident
yeah that's usually where i mess up too
if it does i might have to wait to go in the mid summer
make benny and charlie decision makers
you want a fuckin roof? get building
a fish falling out a tree would be cool though
i need the integral of e^(-.5xx) since infections are an accumulated value
long story short, if every particle in the observable universe was a bit, you still wouldn't be able to contain it
> ou can also say that your number is more than 10^10^10 and less than 10^10^11.
my dad called
nah my dad says the un guy should have warn people sooner
granted i also think he should have, since i knew from watching the news in december this virus would spread fast
yes voting for biden is better than trump
but i still would feel uncomfortable voting for the other rapist
i said voting for biden is better than trump
violating the constitution
racist
biden will at least put the brakes on free-fall instead of firing the rocket thrusters at the sky
reps would have nothing on him the hunter biden thing happened when he wasn't president
the problem is, because biden’s accuser talked about what biden did to her
did bernie commit to the female vp?
instead he brought out all of the rednecks who would otherwise have just sat in their sheds with the ar-15s and complained that john kasich or whoever was just another one of the educated elite who didn't care about them
kasich :(
i thought ted cruz was tom cruise
if anything kasich was more tolerable now inb4 i watch a messed up clip of him and my opinion changes
sums up the 2016 gop race
he liked guns, didn't like abortion, probably wasn't a fan of gays, etc but he once had the balls to say things as radical as "i like having a middle class"
no wonder trump won this thing
yeah
that's the part she never seemed to explain
i always find it kind of fun to look at all the candidate logos for the ones who had no chance
yes he was a libertarian
oh sweet the window key on this keyboard is already broken
thanks gummy, im rich and cool
that carkey thing sounds like a good way to get me a bunch of free cars
i should probably think about games earlier in the day once in a while
~~nah sis is just avoiding you~~
but it's like 5 pm your time
same thing
so youre only good for 12 hours  a day, is what youre saying
thats the tricky thing about math
i may or may not have done that before
well the math nerds of ole agreed to that one for the sake of making probability a cleaner calculation or something
that was like 10 seconds
yeah it really was
yeah
and had a 10 year old voice
fucking world healths people are terrorist
now this fact seems dumb
idk how to even say that word
i ate a cookie and hated it
it felt like a punishment
why do you think i carry salt packs with me in my pockets all the time?
booooom
that's an awful card
well you have a point sis
yes sis
im blowing up her island first!
i bought a play dead emote for final fantasy to reflect my internal emotional state
ida do you need another hug
nobody observe them
not for the prize but more for the fun
they are being mean?
wow graphics are great
well sorta
its your job to save the world, some people just get hit in the process
ive only played like 3 final fantasies and they look nothing like ones they make now
and some of the non-heretics are also very sane
good point
the intro was the most exciting part
this is a good thing
im trying to convince my family im a vampire
what else am i supposed to do?
though my dad said i do act like a vampire because i never go out in sun
like fear of cameras sort of thing?
it's only the aunts + mom for some reason. literally nobody else gives me a hard time about it.
i hate selfies
god damn it now i want to play minecraft
i must not play any more video games until i get things done. i must not play any more video games until i get things done. i must not play any more video games until i get things done. i must not play any more v
im easily triggered by a slight thing
i am too tbh
honestly, i'm a pretty aggressive person myself. having a temper is a bitch.
basically i struggle to tell people apart
demonlord i'm allergic to cannabis, so that is out for me
like, hair is my best way of telling who's who
i can sort of read faces
i know i have a habit of saying "you look like the person i saw at the store today"
wait its possible to be allergic to weed?
i've heard it's good for relaxing nerves, but that's really all i know
in my experience, no drug has made me feel worse than weed
which is really saying something
yeah but that knowledge comes from experience
i didn't read it right
there we go, helping each other
now time to marry the ones that don't
why would i marry elliott or maru though
calm down sis
if you are here i would have told you the password so you can get on the wifi
has eyan streamed it recently?
his grandmother died this weekend
but the museum is amazing
yeah for sure, losing someone ain't easy at all
but i have an idea
but once again i don't have a team
but hell yeah
cool
alright here is how it will work
no overlay, no fancy shit
gummy i spelled rhyme right first try
is because it was my first walkthrough game before my supergummying days
gummy if you want i can make covers for ya
idc if you are low battery
blitzypoo
gummy everyone knows youre the best server owner
so credit goes to sis
yeaj
the only reason im a decent owner is because i have no life
look the bot gets lonely, _someone's_ got to play with him
feed rabbit gummies
oh god
where's the fun in doing things the easy way
what did you do
had to move revalatia sadly
think i put switch on the floor?
you're basically intercepting the signal from the console, making a copy of it using the capture card, and then routing it to both your computer and the tv
guys quick we need more innuendos
it's actually even easier from a gateway
people in the comments are saying he was fired for violating quarantine, but amazon suddenly caring aobut that feels a bit like the boy crying wolf
yeah who even wanted this honestly
happy mod day bringy
final fantasy issues with laptop
he needed more ram in order to play it
so i decided to redownload final fantasy on my laptop again, since i really wanted to play it with you again sis
website
in a serious way yes, in a funny way yes
then bought the full version on the website
i can give it to you if you need it
gums went to walmart
headphones since i don’t like earbuds
my good headphones are about $100
when did i become currency
what, a third pokepark game?
8.42 pounds
people
i wish i had it on recording
woahh

whats an idaho?
“usa is messed up, are you really surprised?”
im forever pissed at that
because the last one sucks
i moved around and realized it wasn’t like mario 3d land
god damn it, dad must have changed the network admin password
or played animal crossing new leaf
i do believe it released in 2007
sword and shield
if someone! mitch didn’t tell me to sell wii u

wii sports resort

cause i don’t wanna be online tomorrow
aggressive lad
but it’s aprils fool
aggressive lad is true
for your bday
wait flubs is it your birthday???
lifes a joke and im the star
the launch of bacon will be funny
i think you should have given up a long time ago
and i can't play my wii games with wii u cause i sold it
galaxy 2 summed up: mario spaceship
galaxy 3 is best
the only good galaxy game is no galaxy game at all
boing
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
at the end of the day it all comes down to personal preference, both games are objectively the same, which is to say amazing no matter which one
super gummy galaxy
flubs v superman
which first level
the pruning message really should go in a logging channel but every time it appears yall say something funny so i leave it in
i can't help it xd
it doesn't help that demon lord is canadian kek
kugal are you a canadian in disguise?
maybe it's not that i'm super nice
i need to be mean to balance things out
but i like my vans
are they white
where they touch the ground
nobody respects the double joke :(
and a year older
they were $98
yup that is charlie, on the couch ottoman haha
i remember what youtuber i watched called koopas or at least the bouncing green ones “humping turtles”
i'm signing off
thank aminal
oh right
flubs happy birthday
thank you both
ok cool all birthday attention has been received, it is now officially a normal day
happy bday
fuck its april's fool
but sis would kill me\
no one answer that
im prob the most aggressive one here
clearly you have trapped yourself
> aren't i nice?
no
oh nice
congrats, you're famous
thanks, i think ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
youcould make the prank being acting clever for a day
that's for halloween
sis i dislike you
and i am clever?
april
i'm just trying to stay optimistic here
im just meh and go along with it
while im sitting here watching, wow i did say i wanted the world fo burn once
i guess that works
so we went to her
and 3 of us were there dancing the manderville at her
it's always weird about things like this
and of course i can't see shit
so it's not me?
now my internet cut
yeah i don't hear game audio
me either
got nothing here
it's catchy
oh i can hear some volume
but it's so low
something
i like how elvis is scottish
its funny
white mage
no clue, ask sis, she prob knows
they were more like tutorials
i like this game
thought it was mordred
so if i get this game, will i be okay? or do i need to get the past games to understand story?
though its story might be written with the assumption that people will expect it to be like the other games
i love gambling
i never do anything about today
seems like a waste
though it's flubs bday
(she thought it was endlessly funny)
lets call it dan day then
i put switch under desk as well
not in my current condition
there made up my mind
damn it
i want to play black mage
im interested
okay then black wage, white mage, and i will think about two other classes
you must first
wreck the black mage
man this sounds better than fire emblem
it's agnes
the other two protagonists are a farm boy named tiz and a guy called ringabel cause he can't remember his name
as well as the new characters yew, from a noble family, and magnolia, from the moon
she looks like one of those maids in pokemon
because of course it is
not quite as interesting as the mysterious d's journal
he was still here a bit after posting that
but it was the last thing he said here
it's hard but try to um relax and stuff
they were the second cities in the game in bd / bs, i assume this one is the same
they finally found out
best wii sports resort game
the one with the uh
i forget what it's called
can be anyone, even a fictional character
but no im conducting this survey because im curious
im a little stumped by this one
theres no universes in computers
im sure id think of more if i gave it a sec
bennys a rad dude
john is just a very social dude but hes also a really good business man, my aunt marie is really fucking smart
gummy do you want a list of people from me also or is this one sufficient?
i love how mafia that sounds
i mean, how i get killed by real mafia people who think im in the mafia
can i steal obama
then there was this one english teacher i had in high school who was pretty cool (yes, english class, i know)
same
chuggaaconroy, for obvious reasons
inspirational fictional characters is interesting
did i do something wrong
i guess there's always paarthurnax
my list used to just be eyan but that changed
for fictional characters
sis you are dark
no i'm just a discworld fan
he likes cats
this is this the shot i tried
i deliberately left family members off the list because that feels like kind of the easy answer
at one point he tried to do the schrodinger's cat experiment but decided it was too cruel and took the cat from the box
was he in the wee free men? i remember seeing someone talking in small caps for some reason but i cant remember if he was in the wee free men
that's sneaky
willie was the loser
what happened this morning?
i think another person would be biff loman from the play "death of a salesman"
did i tell you i attempted to get bringy a laptop for her bday?
oh and i happen to tell her that today out of all days
serena's mom is cute too
she yelled at me
for trying to buy her expensive stuff
i saw this on facebook so imma do it
8/14
nice middle name
nooo drago
didnt they get rid of that a while ago?
i don't think so
drago stop violating the circlejerk, all new stuff is bad
but like kida
gums would never do that
i still want a brand new jacket
never
whyyy
i thought you love benny the most
gummy doesn't get basic slang
yeah but i love my money more than i love any human
stalker
i live in the armpit of america, that's kinda the easy one
come on be honest, it even looks like one
think if you line up some states it looks like a leg and foot i forget where though lol
florida looks like a knob
in a roundabout way she is somewhat right but it's still messed up to say
gummy did do everything to help her
and her mom also told me they would have done the same
my parents are also going crazy because there's more provisions for how businesses are supposed to handle this
be nice
kugal no stop being nice :(
that would be between two raised to the kugal and kugal raised to the kugal
ive got this one pain in my back i cant get rid of
so kugal sad
but also kugal glad that his loved ones are still safe
drago
it's fun
yes and i'm wearing it right now
am in the women's section?
kugal to be fair she does use a musharna in unova
oooh thanks for having my back drago ;p
me too
~~i don't need to wish~~
ida wanna trade hair
from my apartment
but i was in the store
but now recently they just said that employee may have virus
bit of a testament to how virulent this thing is that you need to be wary of places that you were a week ago :p
so im likely okay
tomorrow i need to head back to the city to retrieve my work papers
> ida wanna trade hair
dunno if you want to right now since i think there's a bit of vomit in it
sis is a bit sick
also gummy are you even likely to die from it?
asthma
but my dad says sanders is a godfather
schizophrenia
i'm worried about my grandma tbh
tense
im worried more about people’s um mental condition of this virus? maybe that’s the word
hopefully everyone will be okay
i ran out of materials though
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
depends on the stupid thing
no kugal not so fast, you need to pace yourself! you don't want to burn out on hugs too fast!
kugal i'm going to start a stopwatch and i need you to target one hug every thirty seconds
sounds good in the hood
what did you do
you made me like rare steaks, sis made me nicer, drago got me quit youtube
he refuses
some do, yes ye
....
haven't talked to that one
i was gonna play final fantasy today but well sis wasn’t online so i didn’t get on
instead i proceeded to punch my laptop a few times today
i was doing an essay due next week
it froze on me
and it didn’t auto save anything
also i realized im bubble gum here lol
i think one of you guys called me that back then so i changed it to bubble gum here
omg....
well since im stuck and bored besides essay
gummy wheres todays weird question
fuck
for me it was watching chugga and eyan on youtube that made me wanted to create a username and do youtube which eventually led to all of this
i use that if flubs is taken which it often is because its 5 letters
my irl friends and i don't have anything in common that much
though still think it's easier to talk online than irl
sorry?
we are going to la
i'd get him being 99 but i don't think he'd violate quarantine
dunno if there's many different types of malt
or tortillas
is that alcohol
i probably could have deduced that
like it depends what it is
my family loves both
but for like for milkshake flavours, i’ll try anything
i gotta prepare my taste buds though
so i gotta basically go back to eu mode and try everything or im stuck at mcdonald’s forever
i think that qualifies as "my own dang fault"
you can feel bones in me
you can feel my whole ribcage
i guess thats kinda good
what bone?
though you wouldnt be able to walk properly without your big toe
some of my college blurred together so maybe its true
though you're right drago, its a little disorienting if you stop and think about it
besides, after you start working places and there are everyone between about the ages 19 and 65 around you, it stops being important
i can't imagine drago o.o
mitch don't be mean, you'll put me out of work
i pay you a full wage
dang gummy, how
nightshade why on earth are you up at this hour
no flubs this started before the societal collapse
pretty explosions
kelly the annoying sister
pls tell me her username is cool
it's gummy
why are you using my middle name all of the sudden
i know kugals name is charlie
demon lord is dan
kugal's legal name is charlie the good boy
mitch's name is mitch
fuck i don't remember
i have him on facebook
"michael why did you add a bunch of random people from halfway across the globe?" "i dunno mom, some of the people in my high school decided to move really really far away"
and one is named gummy
five below what
not skittles though
now then
yeah but when he wakes up ill be asleep so its gonna throw an error
he wont wake up because he has standards above dumpster diving
its not that kind of coin
what kind of coin then?
that sounds like the opposite of having coins
i want in and out burger though
jello!
she sounds like she's being interrogated
remember when i told you my laptop crashed yesterday?
i just did
<:skarmthink:692790214531350608>
well...
facts of the day
which is one of the reasons i'm taking so long to get through botw
accurate but rude
first video game
corphish had like 1k subs
thats a long time
hgss is better than crystal but i prefer crystal
and its got like *twelve* colors
its a dog with a sword in its mouth. its on the boxart
ive got the bw and the hgss
im not sure you can hotswap ram
what gothic movie shall i watch tonight flubs?
you are fine
tsar putin tsar putin
i finally live in an age to maybe see a tsar again
my senile 95 year old chainsmoking grandmother looks younger than trump
sooo
err putin or trump?
trump probably has wet dreams of being like putin
trump is a wannabe emperor
if you fail putin he will have you killed but if u fail trump he fires you and rants about you on twitter
id say trump is better
but he pulls some strings
5:07
pick
kim jong un or trump
trump
the only thing trump doesn't do kim jong things is because it would be hard to get away with
i wanna see gummy roast the leader of the opposition in pmqs
that laura ingraham has to be paid to say what she says because i've never seen a female with that much conservative beliefs
so everyone can see it
im returning to youtube
with this video i will replicate
yeah but putin called him up so hes gotta
is mitch one?
if trump was so fed up in the 80s he should have just ran maybe he would have won lol
because he is an idiot which btw he was involved with a model named stormy daniels
i played a lot of survival minecraft in my days
i once made a dnd character who was a rogue called scarlet cross
putin
sorry, spent all the present money on ryan gosling
yeah the tools breaking are the stupidest
thing in new horizons so far
i will break zelda
well
<a:a_wind_faceofmercy:590514191736242186>
zelda sucks!
i stole peach from u in ac already. uve already ceased to be useful for me
...ah
it's not that horrifying
use a wii zapper
i am suddenly so glad theres big age difference between my siblings and i. my brother might have brawled with me for fun (which frankly is something he never grew up from) but he was never word murderous like that wtf
> eh my sister is a little messed up
"a little"
i think she is only like that with me
then maybe we have issue
what you guys think?
amazing gummy
i assume new york for you
fuckin yeah
this means i should probably look through my other old accounts that have shit passwords for any other cracks
do you want one sis?
and go on ubereats
sounds fun
im not good at trivia so i prob will never play
in fact very little is trivia
we only had that one night of hangouts awhile ago
now i see why usa is super screwed up
nope
do i have to teach you how to make friends again?
who needs friends
this guy gets it
download obs, click the stream button
more complex
is that possible?
flubs
“jackbox games probably. idk if i have anything else people would be interested in”
jackbox is on steam tho
apparently on ps4 as well
ps4 and xbone apparently have built-in video streaming capabilities
the sound the pull stars make
ehhh
yeah
you can smell him from afar
wtf is this
i dont know any of the words beyond that
this is what my little sister texted me yesterday
my friend that who i've told about you guys wants to know your opinion on cyberpower's computers cos he keeps reading mixed stuff, thanks pals
your irl sis scares the hecc outta me
i think so
personally tell him if he wants to get it, it's not a bad option, but make sure he compares prices of the parts to stuff on amazon just to see price differences
just remember, nothing is as overpriced as the computers dell advertises to businesspeople in my newspaper
more of an everyday pc or gaming?
nasa supercomputer of what era
<:skarmthink:692790214531350608>
pls do\
i would probably call the police on your sister
let me take a look
500 gb ssd is one windows 10 plus nine times fallout 4
alternatively just wait for newegg to have a sale on hard drives and then slap in a few
you know, i"ve never actually looked up the msrp of the individual components in my computer
true
i don't think
i think her friends do
but at the playground they somehow turned on me, prob what my sister said to those two, and i think my sister’s friend’s brother threaten me, then i believe he told or said something to my classmate that was also at the playground
tensions were high on the way home but i think at that point they all shut up because of what i did
a lot
before her friends meet me, she tells them all the nasty things about me which aren’t true
so when i meet them they want to fight me
i think this recently has stopped??
ever since we moved to city
fun fact that classmate i fought
now that is story time with gummy
im always bad with trips
as long as no one dies
hes either going to visit bringina or hes gonna surprise visit one of us on our doorstep
but sis would likely slam door on me, drago would say no one is home, and flubs would get benny to eat me
napoleon's mother was a hamster and his father smelled of elderberries
bringi is on island vacationyesterday at 4:34 pm
lack of attention, gummys ultimate enemy
shut up
no one knows about this
nooo
but with more flubs
2015
now i deny all allegations that it was me that destroy skype group
because they pretty much werent
then zeal discord
gummyland is stupid
as long as the one weirdo who was soliciting sex or whatever isn't still there it can't possibly be too bad
i don't do anything
different worlds i get it
doesnt mean i like any less (yall are my favorite), its just very different dynamics
could be worse
eh i mean i did introduce you guys to mitch
nahvec
i still get along with the old forum people and i apparently still get along with you lot, but we've already seen how that does not go badly when those two groups intersect
yeah that was my biggest mistake trying to put everyone together
nope don't remember
but flubs was an issue
i wasn't too too sure
she is good at pokemon
speaking of forum people
i kicked her butt with a shuckle
mega
zach likes me
but his fave pony is rarity
zach likes everyone
he doesnt count
is gums cute?
i'm gonna sleep
never met him
those being eyan, chuggaaconroy, and this guy called playingwithmahwii
chugga i assume would be the hardest?
ah the days before the minecraft let's players took over youtube
i have one to chip in
but i'm busy disagreeing with this physics lecture on the basis of angular physics sucking
that person
developed in 2959
also known as sneaky
corphish and i were rivals and people joke that we would never get popular
and then corphish gets 50k subs
did he actually?
gums got 106 followers on twitch
i think corphish criticized your vids once drago lol
this was before he was popular
i mean, they got it to the moon
pony vids work
foiled again
yes drago\
a five-second reaction video of anges shouting "unacceptable" has more traffic than _almost the entirety of my 130-video bravely default let's play_
bios
bios
bringy and me have platinum planned next
but stream is on haitus
cause im stuck at parents home
i would even put new horizons ahead for me
i could definitely see myself getting way into new horizons, but new leaf just didn't do it for me
we'll see if new horizons becomes my new favorite once i get around to picking it up
doesn't even have the game yet
it's not as bad as most places, but you can still save a bit more if you build your own
demonlord new horizons is awesome, i support getting into it 😄
canada sure is obsessed with wanting to have us states
what the actual hecc
oh right the conservative party lol
i can't imagine how bad economics wise it would be for every western province to leave the country wouldn't exist
there are 600 states
it's 50 lol
because they burned down the white house
he will crush them all
blue vs red
no, it the war of sixth coalition
can't believe the british choked in the american revolution
because france, spain, and netherlands helped
wonder how it would play out in alternate history if the colonists lost
right click on me and choose ride pillion
trump hates mitt romney though and he's republican
boris has a history of sexism
nvm got it
hes got a desk
anti lgbt
king harald v of norway
he would be democrat
we got bored
go get married, i dont give a shit who you are
who wants to join?
no your drivers license gets two points and then is killed
fucking liberals
granted that's mainly the governors and trump's fault for not doing a nationwide lockdown
i want somebody who can win the nominee and beat trump i think biden is that person as of right now
i don't because americans are dumbasses, but bernie's all but not an option now
i bet he would be better than biden and trump
"we've forgotten the crackers"
but i got a very strong "you are trying too hard to be funny, and it's not fooling us" feel from it
because one i hate horror
gummy how about i revoke your movie-watching license
and also the one where the knight saves the dragon from the evil princess
also hence why bicycle thieves and batman returns endings are my faves
indeed
then i usually forget what i was doing forever
i mean i can but i would have to stay mute
write your darn essay
future gummy will thank present gummy
gummy has homework during a pandemic what is this
so after a few weeks of not being able to figure out where it came from, i just threw a classic `if (you should not be able to talk to this) { dont() }` at the top of the code file and boom, problem solved
i mean if it works, and it cuts down the amount of time you have to spend working on it, then it's not dumb
efficient
good for their search engine optimization, probably
why did they opt for begin end instead of {}? that's like 6 more characters per block and makes chaining them look even worse
they didn't
i just did it that way because it looks stupid
this compiles equally well
tom scott you mad, mad lad
i'm generally at my laptop
with touch screen
okay
i swear if he dies it would suck
protect the monarchy
true but you gotta think boris is currently in office and i don't think a pm at least in the uk has died in office
it's honestly amazing trump doesn't have it
i guess that’s stupid
ok gummy;s sister, take notes from drago's sister, this is how you do it
hi dad
a parrot
you can't
no i meant is she the crazy aunt or something?
haven't heard that saying in a long time
m!tree
....am i that predictable?
maybe it violated the second law of thermodynamics and made ida smarter but gummy dumber
i dont feel like opening my main
well
rainbows
can i ditch the light saber thing
sure it has
oh wow he has a lot more sabers than grievious does
i mean it's already shown in gummyland that i avoid punishing regulars/mods and let them get away with some stuff because i don't wanna hurt the friendship
i wonder if the discord api can speifically ask stuff to skip the log
i dont think that appears on audit log
same
except you probably should use some discipline on the regulars and mods
get them into good habits
it's hard though because the last time i did that
hence why i am just like "pls don't do that again?
stuff like the zeal server woe message could be generic-ized
thats no good
is he actually being rate limited?
6 actions per second yes
i thought the main concern was the audit log being messed up
so the one on top is the one that affects color?
neither did i
probably
no idea
now this one is sooo me
i wonder if this still works
cryptography math is beautiful
darn
i've been manually making reimann sums when that function's been around this whole time
i don't think i've run into a functoin to do that
argo and i are locked in eternal combat for who can be the biggest loser
biggest loser
thank
because i am a goose
weird
that just looks inefficient though
classy
skarm role needs to be physically higher on the list than the mayhem roles
i thought it just needed the manage role permissions
did you add e !xkcd ####
stuff like summons and mayhem role is all hard-coded and you can't actually access it without being one of us
so is it time to work on e!summon add now?
for comparison
that doesn't include the additional margin of additional features we want to add
you were waiting to figure out encryption before doing that?
eyansays probably next time
holy shit you guys were still at it
do you actually want that back lmao
i could do it, it would take like two seconds
going outside ain't a good idea currently
i can still go out into the backyard lmao
e!gummy
what was e!gummy for
i have more important things to not remember
argo is twitch stuff going to come back or nah
i'll give it the "leave it out unless someone asks" status
it's basically a trello-esque bulletin board
people
although this.toilet=3 was a pretty funny line to have in every user object
```    /*
    most questions in the zelian dialect of english don't end in question marks
    if (!line.endswith("?")){
    }
    */``` lol
don't you have fingers
```function /*boolean*/ lineishmm(line){
    line=line.tolowercase();
    var hmm=/[h][m]+/g;
    var match=line.match(hmm);
    return match!=null&&line==match[0];
}``` lol *2
and yes that is regex
thats way more characters to afford a little clarity
`function utilitybotstats(e)` oh right this is another easy utility one
its easier to do  (97 /\*'a'\*/) at that point
wrath the leafeetoday at 9:53 pm
doing fine
just drawing a swastika
gonna be a fun night in gumland
have netflix?
any other pointless node vm stats that would be fun to include
what other things does process provide?
they are as bad as far right
i just saw a few tweets from these radical feminists
and that because they are a man they are awful when this person is gender fluid
i'm at least 35% convinced that a bulk of the radical feminists are just the alt-right trying to make the left look bad, because there's no way people can actually be that stupid and survive until adulthood
obviously faking being raped or abused is dumb because it taints crimes that could be legitimate
when it was she that beaten him
ok carry on i won't defend anything there
this impacts women who actually do get abused and raped because of the stigma and women are afraid to speak out
i mean when you're a gop member who believes the ancient babylonians are too far to the left, than yeah, pretty much everyone's a radical
faaaaaaaaaaaaar off in it
take any conservative female who has ever ran for office and switch them to the left you would get the same thing
for real though imagine anybody just sitting while watching cspan and saying dang that guy is adorable looking i want to *bleep*
meow meows!
im slandering mitch
yes i was asleep most of that time
damn man you got me
yeah
stay up for an hour or two and then go back to bed
i put food out im not an idiot
oh i prob wouldn't have done that
i get snarky when i feel this way
for the meth or for the breaking quarantine
yes gummy im aware of no meth thats why i feel like shit
by slap i mean slapping you with every dollar bill that equals the amount for the fine
you also get points on your license
tbh he kind of sounds like joe biden in terms of his voice
my governor
that's why they have the same sounding voice lol
i dont appreciate that
i cant be bothered to touch my mouse
you know the one
pretty much
stay up all night
holy shit
stay up
so, archers, lancers, and conjurers
for me it was in the desert and i think it was some old senile guy giving me the speech
who look very alike
maybe my brain made the one i got an old fart because it was funnier
super life pro tip: if you have a name that's related to bathroom humor, don't run for president
but we did have a second president johnson who _wasn't_ impeached, giving a 20% success rate on bathroom humor presidents
dang then we would have had a president dick except it would have been the first name lol
lbj was a potty mouth
that could apply to anything with a subscription
whos the closest online friend to you..
i was like errr mitch, star, sis, and bringina
though i said mitch was a guy
in fact what would be the issue with him just saying stormy was a girl
it's not like you say she's a girl and then he asks if they are trans right
point is i only briefly said who is who,
present company included
omfg
the fact you get my state confused makes no sense
theres only one real state
would not mind living in illinois since it's blue but whatevs
also he thought iceland was next to norway
geography
i rarely gets asked who my friends are lol
i mentioned my quebec friend
also i almost showed you guys what i got for bringy’s bday
so abort
that's a terrible idea
i’ll pm you why
i err mean
also i talked about tenda and drago to my dad
> illonous
that's the only way i know of that would give bernie even less of a chance than he already has
in fact we need more parties
that's why we need more political parties which we kind of do but aren't major parties and we need government revamped so we can replace the house and senate with parliament
which has yet to happen in the part of my life where i've been old enough to vote
they started to insult the other party and stuff
the major parties from what i've seen of third parties would be
excuse you, i'm a proud member of the idiot brain-dead liberal party (so says reddit)
democratic would fit mitch the most surprisingly
and green would surprisingly fit sis the most
idk they rpobably believe in having rules or somethign weird like that
doesn't help that in the republican primaries the winner of a particular state takes all the delegates from it
what a stupid party
birb party
i support the goddamn second amendment
obviously i support background checks and common sense gun laws
that's enough math for today
i hate this theme now
reason why is that anyone making speedruns in mario maker 2 uses that theme
article is spot on
little sister says she will touch me with gloves later on after handing money
okay since you know youtube better than me these days
what about this?
so i guess not all lets plays are dying
aside from the nuzlocke though i don't know how any of the others work
sup dad
wonder if subway knock off has same issue
i think i banned a bunch of funny ones as a joke
at one poitn i banned "toilet" for me because everyone got sick of me saying it
we gotta do that again for a day for the memories
it's like one of the cosmological constants
there it is
the dnc is prob thinking if some backup plan because biden isn't in good health
i haven't played mount and blade warband napoleonic wars
im a happy boi \o/ and i hope everyone else is too
this is the perfect time to be making your sleep schedule go off the deep end
my city population is like 300k so i dunno if thats too big or whatnot, it's a bit smaller of where my friends live
oh dang haha
im kind of thankful for my health right now too
oh damn
i dont go out on walks anymore
yes definitely, this is gonna take a long time to recover from
lmfao i love that
ah dang, do you like guns or are you of the same opinion
can i come?
im not pro gun or anti gun
which is why i normally dont talk about it, i fear being judged or rejected
but everyone here is very mature
and i'm grateful for that
when everyone agrees with everyone on everything, you get situations like this fun one that i had to deal with this morning
i know we're all mature for sure but i have seen some things that just make me scared
we really do live in a world where more and more people believe what they want to believe
and facts are thrown out the window
but it reminds me of the quote, "in an age of information, ignorance is a choice."
off topic but this linear algebra homework is fun because one word tht i didnt know existed but now im having to say more and more is "diagonalizable"
things seem better today though
also my return to youtube joke never happened....yet
there are 358 days until april first 2021
i hate kingdom hearts
i sadly can't stream or have any of my equipment to work on things outside streams
like my platinum overlay
one of them, probably
and then it got put off until 2019
and holy shit i do not know how he managed to do 3 walkthroughs at the same time
back then that trend wasn't a big thing
i watched sneaky play it yesterday
gummy you should watch my new wooloo appreciation let's play series
drago pin fewer folders jesus
im taking flubs to taco bell
im not even offended im just confused
and im mad
what even is a met
red sox it is
they were probably afraid of getting sued for trademark infringement by some sock company or something
or whoever invented socks
and underscores
i mean content id things
mitch who do you think will win the trophy
if you say c9
you won't get money
.....
inb4 gummy asks me to predict another esports match
speaking of which idk if bringy and me have even said a word to each other today
`> text`
and that will never changed for youtube if i do let's play
otherwise he wouldn't make thumbnails for me
that's right, $6 of my hard earned money went to that channel
hell yeah!
(though your stream donations prob go better than your yt donations)
i just have audio issues
weird
apparently the old hd60 hasn't come down in price any, even though it's a couple versions out of date now
not surprised
hey it's worked out for me so far
streaming was very interesting
i 100% copied eyan
that was like 2013-2015
that and i believe sneaky's stream influence me to always talk and shit
so instead of just grabbing random footage from the game or whatever, i went outside and just pointed a camera at my rabbit
my bunny has achieved internet fame
congrats
my animal crossing wild world walkthrough part 1
it was film with a camcorder and ds taped to the wall
we made a bet
and he told me he would get my 3d land part 1 to 1k and in return i have to stream zelda
you two had a weird growing-up
anthony was one of the biggest ones
they disappeared though
are you sure?
that's what i thought
oh maybe
unless they were the same person?
knifeperson resurfaced a couple years back but nothing since then
but fucking anthony i think ruin that
i remember zekrom
and thepikachuguy
when did yall show up
i was there for the first stream on xy launch but i don't really remember much until the next spring or so
i started watching stream right after the transition to king of zeal
well i got into league around jan 20 2015 and i'm pretty sure zeal was responsible for that so a few months before that with the oras streams is when i first showed up
weird i thought argo was around for longer than that
however i didn't make an account till the beginning of 2015
part of the band who sang stacy's mom
remember um
whats his name..
fred the whooper
diemetrycare
let me look through my chat whispers
which errr
skullkidfan was a highlight
now it might be evil of me, but i don't really give a shit what skullkid did because it didn't affect me
i mean the first thing she did was defend you while everyone was poking you, so obviously
i mean hello, gummy is the best
just like people who use rp commands and name themselves after video game characters
hey my name isn't name after a video game character!
gummy belle is creative
dad ostensibly being tiber septim
my first username was awesomesuperpokemon, then supergamespokemon, then superskillsful, then supergummying, then gummy
i see gummy all the time i'm in a store
hmmmmmmmmm
so it's like gummystreams, gummyac, gummy belle, gummyyyy
did you get encryption figured out?
the only places im named gummy is discord and youtube
and thats twitter buttttt
gummy air conditioning
[insert canada joke here]
maybe i could turn this name into chemical symbols and be titanium praseodymium
<:skarmthink:692790214531350608>
i mean uh
except for sites that don't let you pick your username but those don't count because they suck
those sites tend to give you either something auto-generated like "timmyfelldownthewell1568954" or just cut to the chase and give you a numerical id
meanwhile spotify doesn't let you make a username and just gives you one and says "fuck off and you can't change it"
i'm pretty sure it's a gui bug that the devs demanded extra to fix
apple doesn't make me happy but at least itunes is a good media player
that's pretty stupid overhead
finding out would depend on me finding the charger though, which i can'be bothered
i have a hard time waking up in the morning. playing the song of the nation that my dad hates most for the whole house to hear should get me out of bed.
good times
the far right vox party?
i was going to say "why is my other account typing"
no u didn't tell me
this is currently my most popular one
mitch explain
this was back in 2013
gummy admitting he is bisexual 2013 colorized
flubs marry me?
gummy the player
anything you do could work with it
how dare you gender assume piplup
blitz has been converted to piplup propaganda
i'm making the piplup political party
now we just need giant meteor 2020
if your sauce could even be referred to as gravy, you've done something terribly wrong
not trying to get sticky fingers by golly
hmm needs more ketchup
for y tho
this isn't about taste gummy
hi overused dad joke i'm animal underscore man underscore
he's all around us flubs
i think its fucking hailing
and effectively right, the darn things exist just to carry around
10/10 best owner ever
i've got 4 just to sort stuff easily
i deleted it in 2017?
imma send it death threats
damn
so i could access the create new channel
or is it .com??
since i told you guys several times
close
is this true sis?
i wanted to talk about the russian empire
and i cant fuckin get there because someone shut the planet down
tbh in flubs' case i can't do a lecture on this
fair enough
i will not hurt my dog
my little sister ironically just said, "i want someone to choke you to death"
of you getting choked yeah
flubs why do you feel this way? what happen?
subway came to your house?
am i sweet at least?
not particularly thanks
looks better with a clean face
and like chop a live squid and ate it
it was about an hour long
prob sis
so you banned two people
keeps spamming me in dms when they are back
in total i believe gummyland has 480 bans
i dunno why camelot never ban anthony at the start
oh that one
when was this
lead by pogi
but it should have been more dramatic if drago banned me
let the truth slowly dawn on you
you literally were there
you gotta say mean things
err fight it
lol it's so nerve wracking joining a new discord server where everyone welcomes you
he joined sneaky server
no lol
cloud9 server?
this is the thing after six fucking months of not drinking where i just ***really*** want a fucking drink every second of every day
so good i have no channel
thinnk this is one of the 3 vids you can hear me
i told flubs to make fun of you for that
i like making fun of people
2017 people made fun of me
i had extra stuff written down but the rest of it pissed me off so i deleted it
thats the whole thing
and then i move on to the other stuff
and i disappoint everyone in my life more than i did before i quit
but pls not on yt
take a guess people
so get good sleep y'all, it's good for you
oh that's the one game that shares a birthday with me or something
actually i lied
whats with discord trolls lately
“trypophobia is an aversion to the sight of irregular patterns or clusters of small holes or bumps.”
its called people are bored with an internet connection and no motive to read books
i rather stare at my screen and wait for a troll to join for another ban
mario bros 3 is not forgiving
gummy you should do smb1 with a death counter
do you want me to embarrass myself?
you do that already
gummy mario ragetage when
cat mario was the kaizo mario before kaizo mario except even worse
because why not
if they ever remake bugs life it would be nightmare fuel
<:dab_flutters:674908213342240768>
....
this time i died to big fishy
but gummy what have decided?
imma revive my chicken wings channel
i copied a lot of things that eyan did in terms of vids and username
no no no
i called myself king of slamming
nope
you're not wrong
lmao
though everyone told me it was better than supergummying
what?
~~wait we have rules~~
don't relapses
no raiding
i think
we are making rules
youre a game designer now?
in tech terms
wtf are you on about?
but sweetie bot and carl bot should protect us
no u
keep a list of the timestamps of the last four joins
if the elapsed time is less than 10 seconds, dole out bans
one drawback of being a brony server is that we are raided hard
wooo
and said n word
tbh i barely see nahvec around
then i gotta work on 4 year anniversary
i have the best idea for siblings day ever!!!!
and she won't know
i can use this idea for her bday
guys
cause i have a lot of anger issues
canadians cuss a fair bit, we're not that innocent lol
sis's mate word rub off to me so now i say that sometimes lol
i wonder if flubs is okay
then have a voiceless vc with me
it's not a germ though
he doesn't even know what an "infection" is lmao
walked in and wanted to rob us??
i know it was a few of you guys but exactly sure which ones
> eu, i think venice
everyone was like whatever
hey guys
this is neat
when im like in an area walking around i tend to hum the russian empire anthem, idk why but it helps
i'm everywhere
but not enough
what?\
this ain't much a community
im just here
also im not good at helping others
im dead
no kidding, me too
so guys
and he is excited that a sheep is his neighbour
sis is real server owner
i'd also be excited if a sheep was my neighbor, but not for that reason
um what did you do
kitty!
camo cat
honestly that would make mood badd
over the decades the house cat has evolved to perfectly blend in with its surroundings of blankets
the answer to that is yes
what constitues "too hot" in iceland
dunno, i've got a lower tolerance for high temperatures than most people
if you can afford to move to iceland just for that, you probably don't need any extra time off
yeah except for the part where they have snow on the ground until may
only complaints are lack of mcdonald’s
and food would probably be too different for me
the other day i heard another crack noise
but this time
wtf is this from 2016?
me wanting a date and rambling about it in skype, camelot, and prob zeal was pretty cringe as well
though finding a stable friend group back was hard
i had to find people who don't mind me being insane
lies and slander
also guys
bad news
im sorry but biden won't be much better
better than trump
biden would be... okay
im more worry that his scandals will be an issue during office for him
gummy i take it you're new to the republican party
i mean hillary would have been totally stonewalled by the republican congress until we managed to vote them out, but you could say that about pretty much every democratic president since the 90s
i'm confident enough that biden will allow his running mate to take over the ticket in 2024
but many bernie sanders supporters refuse to vote now
the stupidest ones were, "im a democrat but fuck biden, im going to vote trump"
the  worry about it after
biden has to win first and now i don't see that as a likely thing
now i see why most people don't care about politics or get invested in it
if you can only find one you'll have to share
joke's on you, it'll be in iceland
all the days end in r
it just shows what we have to go through in terms of voting
oh it must be fake because it isn't verified
and he made the confederate flag a pattern
so i'm not very big on putting that online
i had more faith in eyan playing tbh since i assume you don't like games like that
and i thought i was the strange brother
well im happy you tried it
granted i can argue bits about the confederates but i would never make a flag like that
that would have beennnn wayyy worse
i don't think  they're above that tbh
i believe it was new leaf
i won't be shocked if fox fires chris for this
"america is messed up"
democracy is hard, yall
if the party themselves actually did the voting behind the scenes they would most likely pick yang as the party leader
demon lord
oh no
go on
they now have 2 more siblings
well then
i'm more shocked max and ruby has a reddit
thats so me
wait they're redoing the teletubbies???
oh gummy i think that pokemon egg ash got in gen 8 ended up being a riolu and not a starter
i heard
im telling you demon lord
don't hold your breath
its ash
well alola didn't have an established pokémon league so we'll see how he does in galar
i also heard that if a deceased [male] family member has permission from the family, they can ||insert a rod into the anus of the deceased, shock the prostrate and have the deceased ejaculate for a sperm sample.||
my sister said the same thing
you at least express some emotions
we are stealing this emote
you don’t want to see that
what’s homestuck day?
never ever mentioned you use to root for a rival team in your favourite esports team discord server
that can apply to anything
you rang
anyways here you go
almost msgs sis when i meant to msg here
data structures, diff eq, circuit analysis, physics 2
good yes
much better
and have me troll them
just a typical day in trump world
that moment when i'm more in favor of states' rights than the republicans
canadians prob take joy in watch trump be dumb along with every nation that isn't the usa
fun fact: when angela met with trump he refused to shake her hand which made the situation awkward for everyone
western canada want a trump like leader
western canada threaten to leave canada for states several timesp
people were protesting when liberals won
conservatives no climate change
not sure where america has most oil pits
texas
i can imagine if trudeau loses he has to resign as party leader
if trudeau does what he did during the 2016 elections
well it's because trudeau only has a minority government now
anyways some literally packed up their shit
and walk through the border
this is different from normal immigrants btw
these people literally left the stuff they had
depends on the person some do have to leave everything
i go with the party i agree with the most
i agree with either ndp or green the most in canada
isn’t new jersey democrat??
mitch lives in the state with the two-letter postal code
nj, ny, ct, ma, ms, me, md, de, va, nc, sc, etc
indiana
no just for the rest of yors
bringina is already planning to take out my kneecaps
drago you said this about sis that one time and that never happened
you also said that about flubs
so what you're saying is, there's a 0.000000013157895% chance that it's gummy
is it pizza?
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooookay
"i live in fucking austria" is like the oldest joke in profane linguistics
whats worse is this moose apparently acts like a dumbass
there is a mineral called cummingtonite
omegalul
i was looking at twitter when all a sudden this was recommended for me to follow...what is this?
people reminiscing about the dumb stuff they did on the internet when they were 11
err guys
back in the day i drank a lot of coffee as you can remember, now i haven't touch a cup in months
lol i remember
now it's milkshakes
no one can stop me
but somehow youtube allows it
i always thought she was more of a sociopath
look at this
i should rename this place to 4chan 2.0
demonlord i agree
i'd try to calculate the samllest by doing 10! and removing the numbers that are factors of other numbers, like 2 and 3
and gum
> i'd try to calculate the samllest by doing 10! and removing the numbers that are factors of other numbers, like 2 and 3
okay that's not quite it, you'd need to remove _all_ instances of common factors
yes i agree drago
what have i done?...
inhale a pea drago!
didn't kirby inhale a pea in the anime
that's so crazy that i stopped reading halfway through. let me try again
just import google api to do it
but i figure it wasn't worth it if i play on 1080p
what were you getting before
clearly they're not using python's technique for strings where you can do "1"+"0"*10000
what on earth are you doing if you can't get 1080p on a 2070
windows calculator cares (probably)
2070 is better for 1440p
the performance of computing equipment is kinda logarithmically related to the price
e!google how much is an r7 nowadays
then you all made fun of my "super case"
i meant ryzen 7 but yeah that's a good example
lol yes
again
13 (6 included) internal 3.5" drive bays
and he casually threw one away
i think i still have my old gpu with me
the one i fried
a 10 core, 20 thread 9900x would be... interesting
not super ideal but i'm good at using it so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
also i'm currently struggling to figure out how to make gravity work because i haven't had to deal with it in about 3-4 years
i need an english person
vortex is alive!!
anyways for skullkid context, i was looking at that twitter i found this morning and i remember scatman vid because they mention it
it's on tip of my tongue
i have no fucking clue who inferior  is
lmfao you got it
don't think he remembers me tbh
get used to it1
why are you up
good ol days
will has fallen into the person 5 royal hole, and we may never hear from her again as a result
that’s horrible
league is better
also speaking of old days and stuff since animal man is here
good
alright i have a serious question
guys in my artificial intelligence class i finally get to play with data and i'm so happy
that makes sense
coding it didn't take me until midnight, it took me less than an hour
you guys are no fun
throwing colossal amounts of data at is is fun because there might end up being patterns in that data that we didn't even notice
it also means people need to come up with new jokes about ai that aren'r "if if if if if if if if if if if if if if"
lol who am i kidding, why let a little linear regression get in the way of an outdated joke
though granted this time around
this virus has affected everyone in some way, i wouldn't worry too much about it
and i hurt my hand
and it's been confirmed by him on stream that did happen
god, why must you do this with such regularity
alright people
you all ruined my fun this morning with your terrible voting about if i should get a gummy shirt or jacket
i'd get fucking decked
no he's a coward
don't call charlie a coward
the wind scares him
but that's okay
probably
guys
boi wöt
it has stupid restrictions
yeah i'm just wondering cause i plan on getting terraria and eyan said he would gift me but i guess he won't be able to
you cannot
they changed it in 2017
i can also relate
then i die again for a week
and my dad bought a air pistol
unless i let trolls in
then again only 3 trolls have joined here
guys
today i will teach you all something important
don't worry i know how to chew my food
no veggies on it
the purple lunatic girl
theres a lot, well i have two daysish to play a bit, guess i have to restart but i'll get through fine
ah, sir piercings
like legit scares me
he does that a lot
big part is the introductions of all the characters
oof i also wanna play final fantasy as well
that's a stupid deal
because she constantly stalks my twitter for info
why are u just now knowing who dr phil is
just watch it
he seems like a bad one
never seen him day something stupid before but wow that is very stupid
woah i just watched a dr phil clip of a mom abusing her kid for lying by putting hot sauce in his mouth and giving him a cold shower
i think antonio brown would be better on live tv than him
im still stunned you have literally never heard of dr phil lol
she used to be hair stylist and always cut hair for her family and for my little side and dad but i always refused
but now i cannot get my hair cut
anyone want to guess what this is for
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
cos t
i'd offer to try to webex support into it, but i'm not sure if i can do that into non-university computers with the license we have on that
he says on installing chrome
is he seeing just the command prompt or is the windows hellscape all there?
he says when he opens chrome this pops up
“chrome will launch as soon as the installation finishes” but never does upon installation and still wont launch, he even tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it and doesn't work
1909 is the most recent major update for windows 10
> it's really hard to make windows not update
speak for yourself
okay the only not-stupid answer i can find on google is try running the system file checker tool (`sfc /scannow`) and see if it finds the installation to be broken or something
yeah ok it seems like any support sessions created with webex will be logged to ensure company use. there goes that idea
run is  for when you want your batch scripts to return something useful
well thats bollocks
youd think they might as well, since windows 10 home isn't what they make their money on anyway
any luck with firefox?
also tell him to show file extensions, hidden files, empty drives, merge conflicts, and maybe turn off autoplay
but yeah you're right it should fall into the actually useful category that is a package manager
update the man fixed it
the problem was ||he didnt update his friggin computer when he thought he did|| but before clicking the spoiler take one final guess as to what it could possibly be and see if you were right
i failed the whole try to sleep thing
i know him
mb on wording
anything change in final fantasy that i should know?
there's normal, which, for dungeons, means it's just a dungeon, with trials means ezpz, and with raids means kinda rough but pretty normal (except with the coils which are definitely not normal level difficulty)
and then there's ultimate.....
and it's a different duty
you get what you sign up for in terms of duties
are you enjoying it?
i have discovered something amazing
i mean i knew i'd like them but they always intimidated me
blitz
well last week on easter we ordered pizza and i gave the pizza guy a good tip cos he delivered our pizza and was cool about it despite the whole covid-19 stuff and the fact it was easter
i had pizza tonight as well
but it was from the store, i heated it up
weird name but yeah
im offended as a canadian now
and that correction on the pizza box isnt fake at all
guess what charlie is doing
howling
im surprise he doesn't get tired from howling
imma watch this beautiful piece of work
hopefully i don't bore you to death
they will still vote him
it prob won't happen but i would like it if joe biden picks michelle obama as vp
biden might pick a latino due to the latin vote
i deleted it lol
but it was funny reaction
you could never
you should watch my vids drago
blitz never watches my vids
too much root beer again
but the power of editing
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
i was talking about earbuds with people in a server
and i remember once, my little sister tried to playfully strangle me with the cable of a broken earbud once
though all were a joke according to her
the most interesting one was her chainsawing a mcdonalds logo and it hitting me and slicing my head off
ur mum is a weapon to surpass metal gear
wtf a shooting in nova scotia
they are more on the uncommon
exactly
i've seen shootings in canada before but it's at a pace where if one happens you go omg but if one happens in the usa you essentially say here we go again while going omg
we don't even get shootings
i think we might have like
can i move there?
i feel offended
okay that guy copypasted the same reply to like a dozen people
guys i hurt myself again
it's always the milkshake
im limping
my little sister just robbed me
that's just what happens during the apocalypse gummy
nah she was just upset she couldn’t get money from canada
i hate discrete math
one of my neighbors was a math major back in ancient history and apparently she had to once do a proof for "proving that real numbers exist"
i tried looking up some basic lighting algorithms not too long ago and i found some pdfs that said "to implement a lighting algorithm, you first need to define the parameters with which the rules for creating the universe will be based upon"
and to that the only reasonable response is to put them against the wall right next to the environmentalists who protested disaster area
oh my knee
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
i'm hyped
kugal pet doggo
no you don't
when was the last time you uploaded
last time i uploaded was today
drago, there this streamer that was insulting her viewers
for not subbing to her
i should work on my next yt video, but mitch
hey i got views doing it somehow lol
never heard of it
my only hater was called "superskarmories"
it wasn't some what's up kiddies nonsense
wait gummy had an intro?
bringina sighs\
here you go, this will improve your vids
and try not to feed
huge problem if i play adc, cause gummy in lane is really bad right now
even though he frown on me over youtube
unless you were to have joined zeal server
maybe i wouldn't be so clingy like i am
well you made mine better ❤️
so most interesting thing i heard ever
my mom once again said if obama or clinton was president and corona happened, it would have killed everyone in usa and that the usa should be thankful for trump
never blames himself he does what we tell our children not to do and points the finger at others
help
my mom said she would have voted for michelle had she chose to run
like pennsylvania, there's no reason why everyone in the state is required to wear a mask
that's not much of a defense
you fail to understand how far our standards have fallen
"imma slice you into pieces, and feed your limbs to cannibals and the dog pound" - little sister
ayyyy
i feel like shit today
gummy will you buy me a 3900x
but that would defeat the point of you giving me free stuff
no better time to start than the present, then
loopy said that original 3ds capture boards will be back soon, however he won't sell any preinstall ones
you would have to send it in
at that point i might as well just emulate it but i like having a physical thingy
they say not to wish death on anyone but i think lots of north korea wants him to pass away
north korea loves him
everyone must vote
that’s actually what it really says
funny how south korea is one of the most technologically advanced countries and north korea is stuck in the middle ages
the two could not be more different
did i hear middle ages?
south korea though i hear is actually fun to visit
also mitch
he believes kim jong un should run canada
he and a few co workers
they also agree all people from prisons need to die
schools are brainwashing people into liberals
tbh the prison thing here is prob true
trump would be the one to say that lol
oh no corona is in nova scotia
the shooting
there was another shooting???
good lord
woah cool
for the animal crossing people of course
what's the news
yeah
what do i do
yes pretty much
and msg me
now this wasn’t the scary part
normally it’s whatever
i lost gummy belle
or the wrong world
show me a screenshot of your character select screen
also gummy belle shouldn't be gone unless she got deleted or if you logged into the wrong account somehow
and checking my friends list she definitely doesn't look deleted
i think ida just roasted both of us at the same time
best of luck
oh god, these fps
welcome to my world
high five
remember your carbuncle friend
how long have you been standing there?
(i was there when i took the fps screenshot)
ah yes
i exploded
as in
woah
tmw north korea will get a female leader before america
you should also have waypoints on your map for where those quests take you
i need a shovel
there should be an icon in your quest log that you can click
i can't show it cause the quest i have now doesn't have that kind of item
you can also just interact with the location
and it'll bring up your key items
nvm, it worked
the quest log should be able to tell you
it's got a picture of a blue rodent
you have summoned statistics
oh yes, i did that once
im best mage
level 8
what level is drago on?
okay im getting to 10 tomorrow
you'll have the rest of the class hunting you down with pitchforks and torches if there's a curve you threw off for them
nice
next semester im hoping i can do diff eq but i may not becuase im for some reason not eligible to enroll in any classes despite registeration period being open
why not?
no i've made like 10 of these videos cos my friends told me to set up funny mic
and damn it sis, you weren't supposed to look in this channel where im being roasted hard
what am i looking at
me winning in subs in 2014
ah drago was my ultimate rival then
guys
<:ppinkiejoy:399725095964246019>
fun fact
gummy after the whole walkthrough thing failed first time
you ruined a hot dog
then i realized i was camera shy
however you haven't tried top 10 videos
that failed
i'm considering it lol
....what is this?!
then i shall defeat you
why do i feel like demon lord would defeat me?
no nsfw
professor acidentally gave me 100/10 in the grade book so my grade is 156.28% right now
supporting biden would just be an acceptance of the status quo politicians he's been raging against for over a year
why would i destroy my channel?
flubs get ready to copyright that shit when im done
it is from that era, yes
the golden era of jrpgs
but yeah the gba version came out like 3 years after the ds so not many people even knew it was thing
hmmm
how am i supposed to play gummy belle in that game?
too hard
how many notes will you make demon lord?
of course now you've made me aware of that so that will help me out as well xd
what
whats the channel gonna be called?
haven't figured that out yet
for the first in my life
sooo
how am i supposed to even get this game?
it's on steam
i think i agree with his opinion
the thing is even if trump had a good opinion you can't take it seriously because he is never straightforward
he legally cannot stop the governors though
the governor of georgia has gotta be one of the stupidest men alive if trump disagrees with him
this i gotta see
what about the person who described themself
nooooo
sis will agree hes the better youtuber, but she would say im the more errrr less annoying one
and he always talks about me briefly when i show up
but doesn't care
and back then he wanted to one day get eyan average viewer
it was during a terraria stream i think
alright no more trigger mitch!!
i would like corphish to beat sneaky's average one day though
ignorant
is stream style is different than mine
we chose to give it a light prod with our toes and then fling it at a trampoline
at least you guys actually have a plan in order
meanwhile our plan is like reopen blahblahblah
not on the farm btw, but i like the music out on the field when i was dissolving rocks
after what i saw on twitter
the place where i live
i hear null island is pretty nice this time of year
germany isn't crazy in fact i it's very lgbt friendly
they still have a nazi party like thing there
germany and me wouldn’t get along well
i prefer living in monarchy like country
nope
not anymore
i'm glad i don't have a copy of your bucket list
it’s called a joke mitch!!!
many people close to stormy said august 1st will be hard
gonna be honest that is kinda scary
oh boy
anyways
"junko more like junk, oohhhh!"
since steam doesn't wanna work with this thing now
retail will slowly open on may 19th which means im back to work sometime that week
> on your laptop?
yup
how doesn't it work?
no this is steam
say it out loud
hmm, i don't even know if i have the energy to roulette
who?
him sis
dad: [describes a thing from history]
brother: where did you learn that? do you have sources?
help
people
there we go
we live in an era where people have the guts to protest
so much
“pro tip #1
try rogue energy yourself”
“that's exactly what terrible members of our sponsorship program try to do.  they create an account, don't try the drinks themselves, then proceed to post "go score some rogue energy and save 10% with code xyz!" all over their twitter. “
well fuck....
i said a waffle tasted like beef
but it does taste like beef
plus exp share in x and y shares it to everyone
that explains why he gets donations every minute
alright
or how come there's both crystal and hgss?
they just left out bw for no good reason
while there's tons of remakes in there
i kinda like black and white more
s&m are obsolete, b2w2 were actual sequels
it wasn't a seperate story, it was an upgraded story
only black and white were unique
xy ain't bad
sorry gummy
though b2w2 is a very close second
alright get out of this server
im reporting your youtube channel
i thought you would be using this
god no
since you don't really use hd anyways
the quality on gamecube is only so high anyway
idk that might be a thing
yeah i'm considering that
i may even do a smaller game without commentary at first just to get a feel for things
there's no way i'm investing in 3ds capture software
pretty hard to come by at this point anyway
i'll sell it for you for 2k
and that was mostly a joke
i would say
idk what a small game is
no wait i lied
also that woman that abused her cats on twitch stream apparently had a nip slip and still not banned
okay so i might be shit at youtube
but im good at giving advice about it
alright, why were there failed attempts on pokemon platinum?
well just like what demon lord said, how final fantasy 6 is gonna be the best project
earthbound?
and another on another youtube
without all the notes
but i failed that as well
i mean for a mario game yeah lol
think everyone already knew that
though like mitch said
it’s kinda cool you know someone who became popular
it’s not like all a sudden you talk to like chugga where you are nervous and everything
it’s easier for me with talking to corphish cause i knew him for a long time when he was like a nobody
that's good
im kinda drunk after waffles
what could go wrong there
it's not much but i always wanted something like this to see what it's like
that is not relaxing
i suppose
i forgot speedrunning was a thing
wait
goes on twice a year
oh..
i'm playing tower defense, again
yeah but that's completely legit from what i understand
games done quick is way more corporate so that's what makes me suspicious
hello drago
nah i really don't
so hide the ugly stuff in 360p gotcha
i guess the other thing is, if you want to put text on the screen and stuff it'll look like a video with 480p text on it if you don't make the video frame size big
like i said
she is close to him
she looks like lawful evil versus chaotic evil
what am i?
chaotically chaotic
what about yourself?
well you are...i have no idea
well there's two axis on this
and i can't quite place you on good
lmao
i don't think im evil or good
then again i didn't know it was christian
and where does playing league of legends all day fall on the alignment chart?
final fantasy on chaotic neutral
that would explain why i can't fully be good
i err mean
the good news is
i mean the good thing is it’s helping children
that would be the ideal circumstance. as long as the vatican doesn't take a 20% cut of your donation before it gets to the kids anyway
from what i read
im watching someone bite someone on stream
wooo forest rain is live
what?
i witness someone who donated $500 to corphish earlier and now i just witnessed someone else do another $500...
he must have really passionate fans if they're willing to donate that much to him
either that or they're just very rich lol
he still gets comments like that when he does stream
well a number of them are out there still
a good number of them are still around but view modern eyan with a degree of ire
and i hate leeching off of people
i like earning shit
can't be making mistakes during covid season
go practice on gummy instead
oh come on that was a clean kill
drago don't answer that
tbh im considering streaming csgo...
i think ponyfest closing ceremonies are coming up soon
ping me
when it happens
you would have to compete with babscon
only $50 per ticket
he's a dj that's currently playing
ah yes
and everyone can enjoy both
mitch you seem excited for this
in that exact order
why didn't you share?
you know i love 10/10 customer server, salt, ew to the rest of what you ate though
figured
im 53 kg
im 65 kg
that was when i was 16
you realize she has the same name on discord and is on this server right,
i see it now
there we go
kugal every time you shorten "because" to "cos" my brain automatically assumes you're talking about the function that offsets sine by a quarter rotation
bad!
mitch i like to see you do better
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
<:sads2:625971430097420288>
i have common sense too!
i swear most random people join or who know me ask me this stuff
should i tell them my secret is to do nothing and let mods do all the work?
basic high school coding
it'll be interesting to see how galaxy plays without motion controls
but rumours only
they could do what they did with the world ends with you where they have motion controls for the docked mode and touch screen for bottom
so i challenge demon lord to mario galaxy wlakthrough
and i will beat him
if i don't get bored after intro
mainly because of how minimal they are
most don't seem to need motion controls
is that the shortcut that makes the desktop rotate or something
oh on discord
wait who is rudy
and every tweet is about him lol
youre probably thinking of bloomberg
people
i'm not sure if i like the sound of that
well
i mean i was using a mouse before but that one sucked a lot
that would be awesome!
and yeah you would know the series
you guys remember bingo for the gba?
took my cash and credit cards and tried to destroy my mouse as a joke
is it pokemon demon lord?
so it would be a lot easier to organize than final fantasy
never played golden sun but i've heard a fair bit about it over the years
the problem with bravely isn't that the bosses are long, the problem is that you need to do ng+ four times
2 seems to have an interesting issue though
it's still turn based
youd think i'd remember the combat system in bd2 considering that i played the demo but somehow i remember nothing
i was seriously bad at the first two first though, that doesnt count
or is it just me feeling it?
i'm confuzled
alternatively, i beat gummy by not quitting on episode 15
if a series doesnt hit triple digits does it even count
since you have to beat four swords and that requires multiple systems and copies of the game
in reality it seems every government was slow to react for whatever reason
mitch
who’s side are you on?
i'm low key fukt up rn
because splitting up community and stuff
i do basically whatever the fuck i want
besides no nsfw
well...
my little sister for yours
well it finally got mentioned in a vid but they mention my name of course instead of my mom...prob because of the paypal
but yay im mentioned??
me too
i have the same shock as trump saying something dumb
or else i will buy you a league account!
laptop with shit internet to watch spider man
quarantine is over
im good at the game
gummy belle gummy belle
this is gummy drugs btw
i was right
mitchhh
imma do double stupid
you would get nothing
bragging rights sound nice
oh come on sis
and that i errr
i buy a lot of toys remember
subs are something i actually wouldn't want if i go forward with this let's play
fame is lame
7 transformers
wow that sentence was good
damn ir
also im stuck still at a part in that game
fuck that shit
oh damn it
i knew this would happen
when did this turn into anime
i hate anime
i mean i could make this cartoon
mostly everyone*
fine i’ll make it cartoon
episode one, taking back the server!
so i wont
lets watch that first
this cartoon didn’t treat kids like kids, they understood kids knew what murder was like
what should i watch sis?
wait this isnt applied math club
do you ever just
```c
int r(){
  return r;
}
```
demon lord biggg news
i would watch mha with gummy
to celebrate
i shall binge watch all 7 seasons of max and ruby
we had to put some gross pasty stuff on one of ours once so they stopped pecking her
if an ill-fated comment was made by a time traveler, did it age poorly or did it traverse poorly?
whaaat
you would think people would be using them when a shooting happens
just people aren't as insane
they are better automatically due to less shootings in canada
comparing it to the usa is valid
that's a good thing
this ban will not stay
next election
ontario seems to always vote liberal
ontario voted conservative
and ndp
i'm looking at the map
yeah they did win the popular vote
in regina
2016?
it's the 2016 electoral map
covered in blood
write down an esports player name
nisqy or something
if by vote you mean prob having to mail in my vote which will most likely be a crap shoot in how fair it is
but i don't think the most written in nominee has been on an esports team, though they do have a twitch stream
yeah biden doesn't seem to have the energy to take on trump i feel
it's hard to care when the voting system is rigged
my point is that they don't care enough about removing trump
i don't pay attention to the neighbor's gas valves when my house is on fire
bkuz its a gud game
only intro is good
i only made it past intro
are you still disappointed im me?
today has been a mix of awesome and irritating already lmao
yeah i understand
wasnt he one of the "lolz im so random" gang?
yea i think so
he then started to act like meish?
wait
i actually learnt to read
now i can legally graduate
cause if we go with sis time then about....6 pm for me
then i go insane
thats my weakness, sooo drago, you better not pull that on me one day
have you had rice porridge?
blitz get out\
do you want me to suffer?
night
i didn’t think you would actually be mad at me...
<a:ponksad:525086852638572555>
seeing how much you can get out of f2p without spending money is a fun metagame
oh sis....turns out i know someone who's worse at reading then me even though they are better at english then me
apparently if he had read how to discord screenshare, we would have sound for a long while now
i could use some assistance
happy birthday!
happy birthday guy who kugal finds sexy
i have bad news
silly gum
people will take what they can get in quarantine
fuckin keyboard
it goes to the vveb guide or something
since your hotbar's unlocked you can just drag it off the hotbars
i just right clicked and removed
my nickname applies a bit to me now huh
one stressed me out and recently i think thats why it really affected my mental health throughout my teenage years
outside of the tank classes, the mele classes are
alright
i think i want tank
since it's best to understand how dungeons work before going tank
yeah, i will stick to magic sis
and wait till i got the hang of it first
also my new theme
neat
will do
i was about to ask what you were talking about demon lord
yeah told you i forget fast
2andahalfstooges
i typed that in
and i found this
twitter
and i found that
yeah but why
i found one thing
whos brian?
probably something boring
how much?
all together on youtube
while for streaming
prob close to $100
all of it came from demon lord
same thing
he was like the candyman of my channel
as for twitch, it's random and well prob demon lord gave me the most even though i tell him not to
i prob did both
demon lord
because i couldn’t monetize it for a month
your first mistake was attempting to monetize your vids
as much as i like sun and moon
so i had to learn about the game fast and well
boom
dang
you were there
wow im washed up
you know
drago i think i had 14 and photoshop 15, but then i upgraded to 2017?
for that matter
then again
basically for my mario walkthroughs
1. walk up to it
2. let it murder you in the face
koopas
well i think covering a link to the past will be quite fun
i've only beaten the game once thus far
demon lord it's a _final fantasy_
link to the past is a game i could learn a lot faster than an rpg
i'm the zelda nerd here after all lol
probably
oh yeah
or flubs
i gotta make sure my switch capture card works
didnt you already
nope
do i
my internet at apartment works fine with 720p
but sometimes we do get frame drop
but nothing bad
but i wasn't sure what to pick
yeah wouldn't make much of a difference
i also saw this one
why did i let him get away with it?
candyman, inferno was also in chat
or something like that
i vaguely remember that name
drago how about you lp all the final fantasy games
but it keeps getting pushed back because there are so many other things i want to play
later
why are you tormenting me?
becasue it's funny
ebf5, bravely default ii, sword kinda, elder scrolls 6 if that ever comes out before i die
there's usually very little cut out so even a moderately long vm takes a looooooong time to do a lets play of
visual novels
tbh doing visual novels kinda pushes the boundary of "are lets plays copyright infringement" closer to "yes" because there's less interaction with them
but also, they're fun
this has been the longest time since i started to buy pokemon
where i haven't gotten the newest game
im very excited to do plat and oras though
mitch
thank god
right?
that being said
galaxy brain
there you are
someone in nova scotia
is screaming over gun ban
i could easily figure that out lol
i mean i have seen liberals who are pro gun
but says all guns but hunting guns
should be illegal
pffft
no joke
is canada so jealous of america's being the laughing stock of planet earth that theyre starting to feel competitive or something
just give western canada oil and more jobs or something then they will be fine
giving oil
would make the point of climate change obsolete
even though we complain harper was too liberal
kinda makes me wish some states would wish to become canadian
we had people run like that before
and praise
doug ford being an example
hes like mini trump
i can just picture trump destroying canada if he ruled
i can see trump destroying a lot of places
including many that he did rule
gummy guess what trump wishes he was
dictator
i wish this person ran canada
you can be conservative and not be a jackass it's just trump has made it seem that way
quick mitch, what colour shall the party be
wait drago
wasn’t there an eyan 2020 campaign?
wait that’s a bad idea
i'm not running
gummy is stalking me
help
call it inspection
island inspection what is this lol
cause you never finish or play a game well
why is youtube telling me drago uploaded something?
i think
i have
he wants me to be like that one guy he knows that makes games
because that guy earns 5k a month
wanna be youtube rivals again?
time to relax and watch my fave streamer
people
the real question is why are you up
mostly b though
~~play final fantasy 15~~
cloudace
#9615
not youtube
now if i can ever find another
i swear about 100 times irl a day
what are the odds?
i feel good now
11-15 year old me had that energy and drive to become the best, but horrible english, editing, filming, and schedule issues led to shit vids
cause uploading is easy for me
it was google+
they banned my google+ not youtube
my youtube was force connected to it
but so far nothing on me
so im sticking to twitch
twitch as of late obviously doesn't have a great track record for bans
plus stormy and i built this together
stormy hated my cids
why didn't you just upload clips from your twitch streams to a youtube channel
fuck that
it’s not family friendly
i like streaming
and i can actually finish games this time around
but i cannot commentate on game well
idk as a streamer i always worried i am boring
he's a pretty good dude
verlisify is pretty much a d bag in general
he also constantly clickbaits
nor basically any community besides maybe mlp and league
always picking a fight
no he's not
joe merrick
guys
"capable of killing humans, their venom and stinger"
oh boy
i have that weird urge
they're starting to ease restrictions now
i see
i mean i am but im not as well
i got to see a spreadsheet eyan was working on last night
whatever comes into mind, i do
i should exercise as well
then again i react to things differentyl
same with youtube, i had many plans written out and they never work
yeah i don't know how i would even begin to go about that
these days i follow what i think of first
i keep saying x and y after plat
then boom oras comes to play
it's not for me
my bad luck streak is still going
i am gonna show you something
about the info in mario
i quickly typed that out btw
there was more?
then yes...there would be more
i would even be more boring then an eyan league stream
you know something
can’t do that in city with lots of people
centrist
i always was lol
yeah
i would just emulate
he’s been selling them for a long time
only emerald and firered
i might see if i can pick up a used 3ds and see if i can get a capture card installed on it
unless he does 2ds xl ones
i can throw that around without worrying
how would you like it if your capture card threw _you_ around! i bet you wouldn't like that, would you!
my sister once threw my 3ds capture card
one of the few times i was really angry at her
is the premier the mayor or something
mini trump guy
yeah my bad lol
"yes i smoke crack cocaine"
of course the nra would say that
.....
congress has to approve both of those or something. it's not going to be used so it doesn't really matter
hes back....
mitch that is not a relevant question on this server
does anyone even remember this youtuber
eyan somehow comes back 2 weeks later
old school poketuber mitch
i see
hmmm
how long will i last?
the truth hurts
nice
im so happy lueroi is back tbh
hey im the god damn weezing here
oh my god my name looks wrong for that
"i'm a tweet lil' bird in a gilded cage, tweety's my name but i don't know my age, i don't have to worry and that is that, i'm safe in here from that old puddy-tat"
shittt
also sis
15 questions is not enough to accurately measure someone's understanding of english
well...
close enough
thats ok colleges don't grasp that concept either and hence the sat exists
sis remind me to tell you about that weird dream i been having like next week
same 👍
tbh i was opposed to the idea of a politics channel here because i don't believe politics should have a place in this server
yay anarchy
politics has made me want to leave this server about 10 times
we are gonna try the channel and see if we can reduce it in this channel
if we can then maybe you guys will enjoy server more
though i will say ever since flubs kinda disappeared we been more about politics because usually it would always be me and flubs talking about something funny
just going through stuff
he”ll be back when he’s feeling 100%
i am?
inb4 meme vector fields
what woes thee?
this is a very realistic dream though
is it a nightmare...no
i could tell blitzypoo last night
one of them being my boyfriend so he was the one i was worried about
reason why i wanted to accommodate for you is because i had a feeling others felt the same way
can you even comprehend how quickly we'd be rate limited
that's still too much though
i moved it down
i was joking
there can be no fairly moderated discussion in a channel of that nature
do you want me shot?
cause i will pull a logan paul in north korea
you have a point
blitz i need a new intro
are you sure calling some kiddies in 2020 is a good thing?
> what objects do you see looking k̂, those who have made it this far?
how tragic
if you fail that one, then maybe emphasis on the cry in crystal
i'm only counting streams, not videos
so the only thing i failed was platinum but that was me uploading it to twitch
i still wouldn't mind seeing you play ct, it's fun
plus i remember you saying it reminded you a bit of pokémon
i don't remember that at all
idk, it doesn't interest me enough to stream it on twitch
i finally saw the guy who my dad says makes games
she looks like taller drago
but yes this guy apparently makes games
i found his twitter
someone explain this to me like im a 5 year old
it's a game with buttons and things of the likes of which
blitz shall i play this game?\
idk blitzypoo...doesn't seem like my style
i didn't think anyone in the pokémon community was even all that familiar with chrono trigger
what is a chrono trigger/
makes sense
what type of fan am i drago?
i made her an editor of channel
is this a dependency or a habit
think i will succeed?
to possibly fail
noooooo
i keep losing and not having fun anymore
probably should stream ffxiv then
but sis did tell everyone streams the end stuff which i don’t get, im watching a stream currently and confused
i really like ffxiv though because i can be relax when i play it
and i always wanted to bond more with sis
i say just reasses your happiness with the choice you made, if you're happy that's all the matters gumbotron
heck yeah im happy
and negative stuff come from it
like im like deci
eh i’ll start playing more ffxiv, hopefully catch up to sis’s level and fight a dragon
people
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
it's intel from 2017 what did you expect
for the stat line to be a bit better than my fx 4350
though i'd guess the 7700 has hyperthreading and 4350 doesnt
i7s have two virtual cores, yeah
time to go to
the second walmart
i saw something amazing
we were assigned to make a ted talk in english
darn
i have no idea what to do with mine
that requires effort
which pi model do you have nightshade
uhhhhhhh
come to think of it i have a lot of computers that need purpose applied to them this summer
i wonder if i can just take a bunch of scrubbed hard drives from work
at one point i had seven hard drives in varying forms floating around my room
i know one of them's died and i'm not sure the whereabouts of at least two of them though
gummy being here isn't an complaint btw, i told drago that like 7 times
i can feel your disappointment radiating through the screen
> 4 windows
x: y: and z: are actually just subst drives that redirect to various locations on c:
but that still leaves six though
the drop seems to have killed it
working with video means space vanishes fast
it was a pentium wasnt it
same
i should probably bring my pc in to work every three months to give it a nice dust removal with the actual quality air compressor there
you said you hated amd about 18 seconds ago
i do drago
but if i commit like i did
i need the extra money for toys
the sockets are different so you're not really deeply invested for an upgrade
not sure if ill keep it that way. though itbhas served me well
im a toy collector
i already sold both amd and intc so i dont really care what you goofs buy now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
xenoblade chronicles
how about we all play ffxiv/
it is 1:40am
noooooo
nah, i just didnt like the game
i mean errrr
lmao gummy
only children play minecraft!
gummy i'm literally a twentysomething year old living in my mom's dungeon
good job you built a dungeon
people look at my funny
idk why
they're just macro definitions ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
that violent!
a programmer has a problem, and they decide to solve it using threads. two problems have now they.
reee
if /r/programmerhumor can get away with it so can i
there
what i don't go on reddit ar all
double nope
wait i don't think i can banned her
there's a scene from yes man where javascript roasts everyone
but i never claimed to be
so that the program works as intended?
math likes to call this an absolute win
and then on the complete opposite end of your program you pick up the reference by sheer coincidence
michael
it’s almost 12
aaaaaand just like that my computer loses internet
i consider inviting her here but prob not best idea
i don't even bite that hard
not literally dead
well i bump into cloudace the other day
is "telehone pole" a  valid personality trait
what else?
but nightshade is tougher
there’s no..clear design for this
i already kinda understand you from watching speech patterns and stuff
though im on my own this time
sooo yay
okay my internet's back and i got to finish watching the javascript roasting video
not an "error" since i did it on purpose but usually when stuff starts to look like that it means there's an off-by-one in my vertex data which is always a good debugging time
hey! sis likes my nonsense half the time!
i want in on this
hell yeah
let’s hope you don’t take a month to unlock isabelle unlike a certain someone
wouldn't this be a test pattern and not speech
i would kill to play xy right now
ahhhhhh
until she is alive again
ur mum's planning crazy shit
yeah lol
omg mitch
just a tad
i think i know how to design nightshade's oc now...
i see
sorry man i dont have any disposable monies
but but toy
oh crap
mitch move your arms! kick with your legs!
oh god oh crap
watch good stuff
"put spongebob in your hands"
scott the woz is almost at a million subs i believe
currently at 963k
very nice
watch this
for the first time in my life
drago nooooo don't aboose your mons
is it already
also i noticed something recently
and always hyper
and they both live in atlanta
stop for a sec
i swear to god...
he already did though demon lord
so i feel like he will get revenge
i can't imagine the writers giving ash a legendary though
ash commanded 3 legendaries in an x and y movie
i guess
you could be right
there is a reason why i put faith in ash even though he loses
plus he helped a lot of pokemon, for example, he took in paul's chimchar who was abused because paul wanted chimchar to master blaze but did it in an abuse way that hurt chimchar
yet ash somehow managed to get trust in chimchar and eventually mastered blaze when chimchar fully evolved
he also understood froakie
ash is a caring trainer who puts pokemon first
i thought u never watched hoenn gummy
same with battle froniter
as for black and white
that was a shit show
and it became less stubborn
as for sword and shield
gengar was abandon by it's trainer
but ash later got gengar's trust and gengar wanted to travel with him
as for black and white
he doesn't deserve shit!
and he was late to sign up
ash had to beg nurse joy to sign the guy in the league
imagine begging nurse joy to get somebody to sign up to a league only to lose to the same person
who doesn't even have the maximum amount of pokemon needed because he didn't realize you needed 6
how about you don't watch black and white at all
cause i can do what i want!!!
i don't remember my 2014 password
let's see copy of mario galaxy and the sequel for good measure
a piplup plush which would cause pain and also scare him to death
let me ask my boyfriend
my boyfriend has just informed me that he was fucking with me
no no no
i've been told i sound a lot like bill wurtz
honestly kinda want to get to silver and quit for good
the day gummy stops playing league is the day pigs fly
youve been saying you were going to stop for about three years now
thought you would be interested
since i believe i recall you like pirates of the caribbean
i heard 2 was decent
i seen 1 btw
anyone know why i like those movies?
is it the navy?
oh wait did i start this
fuck
i suppose guns and ships are acceptable though
holy shit...
and i was basically like nope not firing
i managed to fire like 5
oh my this is nothing like a musket
magic is a reference to final fantasy character btw
oh well time to play final fantasy
i was supposed to recover tools from pirates
yes i can return to the thingy thingy
but i rather wait
and a
"i can't leave you alone for like 3 minutes and this is what happens?!"
omg that was amazing
oh...
there is some toxicity in this game but not the same type as in league
guess i gotta make it more toxic
i do suck at it
what ida is trying to say is that she's better at sucking than you
that sounded a lot better inside my head
:thonk :
better
question
well
technology developed a bit different there
there is a car
okay thanks, well shit...
no fair
yeah that's the maximum allowed level
not the required one
don't stand in the cho'gath q
wouldn't bother with more than 3 personally
okay thanks
lmao
but now sis
i understand my two poisons
and i believe i know when to cast it again
since i saw how it can tick down
casting the spell again while it's still active resets the timer
doesn't work for things like stuns but it works for poisons
sort of?
the game explains it later
yeah a lot of the info early in the game is something the player isn't very equipped to understand
so far i had two flashbacks
nah i am good for now
if it wasn't the actual moon
but i understood what she was looking at
dalamud crashed down into the planes of carteneau 5 years before the game
can i get a lift back to farms?
this is so fun
how i get off?
thanks for the ride sis!
in rooms are now available
nice
also
guildlevels are available
errr that link australian person
maybe
but what i don't like is, that the second you say something that might sound wrong
they jump on you fast
all i'm good at in it is waiting and seeing
yet somehow people consider me a good player
in your guild
thanks
why?
whats that
applying the appearance of other equipment onto your equipment
that's without glamour
do you have a favourite?
the trick i used to have the same outfit with and without is a bit complicated tho
the current one is the glamour
you mean this one?
well i do like it a lot, especially since it cost me 2 million gil to make
for me i really like your pirate one
in your character window
deselect this to hide your hat
ohhh
or only me?
i look weird
but man you got all the good clothes, i can't wait to actually get cool ones
and how do you arms fold?
lets see if i can find it
i did?
okay so pose in emotes
which means i can now also poke sis
night sis! *hugs*
g'night
this is the greatest troll video ever made
i'm prob going to just keep my flag the default one lol
i don't have time to use an app
they're nuns how lewd could they possibly be
misty is upset over the gun ban
hmmm
it’s very rare to see someone who is lgbt friendly that is conservative
i shall pick up a 2ds xl capture card
have you ever asked her why she identifies as conservative
pepto
it's exactly how it sounds
pepo!
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
gee can't wait
drago
you all can't even pretend to compete with the programmer shirts, just saying
i actually knew about that pikachu no drama shirt while watching a pokemon center vlog
well not really but still
meetch
my little sister wants to use bb gun to kill me
you are like turning into viking sis when she is sarcastic
my dad bought it
it’s his bb gun
i'm sharing the greatness
so carry on
with your host, animal man
they are very important
i mean
quack
oh wtf
try again with this
i think that was ida
maybe this belongs in <#643272338279890954>
more gummy quotes
here's me making time work again
getting wacked with a spoon
also like 30% of my phone's entire camera roll is stupid moments from chat
what cpu did you get?
especially the “disappointment in you” emote
floor there isn't very charming
i mean i've had splattered shit fly into my mouth so it's just like
farm is hard work, i play hay day, it's a mobile farm game
that doesn't count
i wonder if it's possible
but make it actually fun
as in
it barely functions
speaking of sheeps though
yeah i might try smiling at the sheep this year
depends on whether i mean to smile or intimidate
the difference is the intent behind them
then it's the normal one, not the shark one
but thats very rare
the end of an era
some must end faste rthan others
or somewhere in between
sounds like you need a break
try playing guitars isntead
fun fact since we are talking about music
was it good?
i think everytime someone talks about my username
the song is psoted
i need a new username...
what about the fanmade sinnoh pokérap
never mention unova here
are forbidden to be mention here
okat
well im already getting mad at this show
cat pic
what is that pose
/huh
that's what it looks like if you apply the ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ animation rig to a skinned mesh
well i mean ehhh though it's still scary
so none of them care about your safety
yikes
say it's not a joke
what gummy has is mental problems, his sister is something else entirely
i also have mental issues, i don't like my little sister
or shoot her as a joke
im honestly not even kidding, youd probably be justified in making a complaint at the police or a social worker or something at this point
(admittedly that might be illegal but)
wouldn't make a difference
like they don't think im lying
i can't, she's my little sister, i still care even when i don't like her
im not messing up her life
it's not hard to go from "hey i'm not punching you that hard" to "it's not like i have a gun to your head" to "look it's not even a real gun" to "why are you complaining, the real gun isn't even pointed at you" to "bang"
hmm well college was part it
living by yourself looking after your little sister made me a bit more responsible
and i respect sis more then parents because she doesn't constantly pressure me with stuff
i must be dreaming some good news
sounds familiar
i did like 20 practice problems today and they took me an unreasonable length of time and were very often answered wrong
my advice is take breaks as to  not pound your skull into a wall cos this shit is so goddamn easy to fuck up
you are stress
kugal can you teach me how to dot product
oh man i had to do several proofs with dot products
i’ll be online in final fantasy soon
neat
so much for that
did he die
sorry was eating dinner
drago log in
alright currently logging in
grats
we never found the body
it's a level 60 raid
oh sis
so purple/blue quest are important right?
i got two of them
gummy belle in the cut scenes
k'lyhia
bad news sis
but i can't do my quest
cause fate
nvm i ran
im in a weird town now
should i teleport back?
okay
i should register for all of them then..
this thing is fun
who is saying this stuff to me!!
like it's killing my ears
i teleported in and you were standing there
the level 10 quest? i don't remember where that is, maybe in lower la noscea
i can teleport but i don't wanna waste my money
you can use the city aethernet to teleport to places inside and just outside the city
oh yeah
does that cost anything?
welp
attune to all the crystals on the map you get to there
you going to come as well?
and then i have trouble avoiding bomb blast
it means you can unlock new classes now
but level 5?
not this one
where's your main story quest? >.>
well if you remember where it is
would probably have been better to accept the quest tbh
all the npcs are in all of them
holy shit
this place
it's in a place called shirogane
my pose is that
no clue
i wanna see your house!
yippie
actually i like this song
also yes dragonsong is one of my favorite songs
though the song before
soo...i technically did managed to arrive at your house so where do i camp out?
next up: insatiable
it's still answers
also im totally the taller one in the game
wait i do have dragonsong i just didn't put it in
insatiable
nope
i got into the habit of doing that
also i managed to screenshot the sequel before you left
two siblings waiting for drago to come in so we can beat him up
woooo
named good for what ales you
requirement for that quest seems to be
also level 14
sounds good
well out of everything i head
help i was asleep for two hours
clearlly, the question to
i slept 14 hours today
you're going to have to start regulating your use of the number 14 otherwise there might not be any left for tomorrow
i'll start regulating it on may 14th
i guess i will set up a tent somewhere outside to camp out
i feel like i'm goign to have to call someone on the phone and start asking why my cpu appears to be on its way back to california
if you want to get back to your questing you'll have to teleport back
i wanna explore the exterior of your house first
gather two million gil first, reach level 50 and get the rank second lieutenant
then the nightmare begins
so you didn't give up?
sunk cost fallacy is "i've already put so much effort into killing twelve youtube channels but i feel like i'm really close to succeeding"
<:skarmthink:692790214531350608>
thats me with animal crossing
"i've spent 4 days trying to make this code work, and i don't even need the feature that badly but i just wanna show it who's boss"
how do i return?
it's the button next to teleport
im gonna log off
np i had fun
though i still have trouble fighting
you rang
mitch you are my new youtube manager
we are returning!
i need to warn susan
noooo sis whyyyy
may as well get to it now
many questioins
sad day blitzypoo
also my skin is astrotrain
sad but happy
for real tho
but i got roasted hard
or they watch other people make mistakes
as far as i'm aware, there are no bugs, therefore, there are no bugs
couldn't they have screwed up the $6 thermal paste that i could have gotten from literally anywhere
>  smart people don't make mistakes because they're smart
smart people don't make the same mistake twice
they make it four or five times so they can really get the hang of what not to do
and then they do a/b testing with similar mistakes so they can try to predict the behavior that will not be a mistake
which means science hates the double pendulum
except for the chaos theorists but we mostly keep them confined to the one office down the hall that nobody goes in ever
we let the chaos theorists hang out with the other entropy fans
ah cool
i have two extra rooms now
today i finished setting up the 3 houses
you can move them later btw
but will cost money
villagers can go wherever, not really concerned about them
because i been with parents for over a month
i just made my fifth ff14 character
guys today i learned i don't know excel nearly as well as i thought i did
close enough
converting previously functional programming code to object-oriented code is fun
also drago
what is this?
you have a new icon?
gummy i already otld you about that
who gave you rabaon's deathcap?
i'm not the one who put the hat on wizardragon
then again i keep telling everyone im a decent adc
yes nightshade eat
also guys
my god gummy why
fred is great btw
im more familiar with fred the dane, but
also copyright is not the right word
git branched?
i mean...i didn’t say that
<:pinkie_awkward_smile:636655055134785558>
before ida?
yeah
yeah for example there was drat— [dragonite has been removed from this plane of existence]
i think at one point there was
i think there was 4
cause both 2 and 3 was taken
oh yeah that was around the same time that dragonite had his previous name
so when the switches happened i thought it was just one person evolving but noooooo
i deleted the dimenticare account because apparently someone broke into it and i didn't feel like changing the password
no you haven’t
memory leaks, man
i have an identity crisis, am i gummy or supergummying?
that's not quite an identity crisis
i can remember ida, kay, dratiniiii, blade lord nay
oh how could i forget, i’m counting viking sis and sis as two as well
lmao
mordred
i must have missed that one
also i think it's time for me to sleep now
hey drago
are we talking streaming or what
otherwise it would be 4
super mario 3d land, crystal, and platinum
is this a good idea doing 3 things at same time?
granted mario 3d land is not a complex game by any means, it's just a suggestion
and pokemon when she is
ah yeah true
but crystal is one of her fave games
gummy why do you insist on making things awkward
he might just end up using dovahzul translations of each user's name
i'm kinda-sorta forced to use a normal font because one of the first people to pledge had an accented letter in their name and most of my joke fonts don't have accented letters
i get more tired then i was last year
not for me
also blitz
i can't get through the episode
mitch you do that
imma add a cutie mark to it
but seriously
anything can be a valid cutie mark
give me moeny
they got a kid to bully franklin
now this is getting interesting
fucking bullying franklin's friends
franklin sure
i found this at random just now
as far as i know, me, bringy, rainy, bunni, nightshade and maybe mitch have more of it than you, drago, master, flubs, etc.
ohhh
i see
sis started vlogging and showed me and i realized she was even better than me at it
mixed everything up and you have sis figuring out youtube better than you
so i was like “eh, next”
nvm switch battery dead
im stuck at the now loading screen
thats bad right?
i'm in a dungeon
wow you were right
it was fast quest
sounds like a good exp grinding area
press initiate
city state levels have been unlocked sis
idk what that is
but it's your first group content basically
guildhest are now available
i also now have better pants
level 12
okay thanks
i learnt resurrection
nice
okay franklin is being a dick again....and no i did not afk to just watch franklin
slugs attacked me....but then the fucking jackal came over
then i kill that jackal
for revenge
i was about to say who wouldn't help poor cute gummy belle
i'm still amazed you haven't been hit on yet lol
it would be funny
though i would need some dress
probably
i can play  more since i will finally have 60 fps
i told you i can get addicted to another game
league in 2020 is a dumpster fire
2018
omg new soup
before it became a cash cow lol
i should be playing phantom hourglass on it
that’s basically copying me
i'm gonna go with roy
4th?
thank god
lemmy
my little sister and i got two scratch tickets each
now none of us won anything big
soooo luck?
luck it is
no duh it's a fake lol
how am i supposed to know
because why would scott join a pony server
shut up
new design!!
has anyone looked at r/worldpolitics in the past week?
sheep are just big bunnies
sheep!!
people
now time to troll drago
honestly i am tempted to do this
franklin is making me mad again
oh yeah
my aunt didn’t like her son (my cousin) and his gf giving her flowers
sounds hospitable
better tell your cousin that his time and flower money is probably best devoted to other things
he’s like drago but less nerdy and more social
like old classic
you can get a 7 day free trial
so that means i can play anytime i want right?
as long as you have internet
you buy them and they are yours for good
i can see why he has that name lol
where is the cat
i only see a teeth monster
i get that the networking card in the switch might be sucky because they had to make it so small, but you'd have hoped the online service would have at least stayed the same
playstation and xbox live charged money for online from day 1, and it's not because they hate their customers the problem isn't that you ahve to pay, the problem is that nintendo's isn't super good
didnt they?
i want to carry switch around and play super mario bros 3 or world
but if i need internet
yeah thats pretty dumb
who doesn't compared to the switch
i shall be on pc permanently
ik it sucks
and apparently they figure out on their own really fast
strange, i recall it being no more than 2 consecutive terms
i think it's alette maybe
cute
and somehow assume you got me into the game
i mean league name
yeah
it just shows you what emerald and topaz carbuncles can do
free teleport?
athernet
limsa is the only one of those you've been to
did you find me?
oh i just saw you
i need to talk to talk to someone in limsa
lmao
she's the armorer guildmaster
i have a far quest now
also i should be accepting the new armour right? not the bronze piece?
afking for lunch
i was just afk there
basically, the drydocks has the final section of that story arc.
ohhh
since well me straight up leaving would be kinda mean
eh, just let me know if you do
the calamity did a lot of things
and after
the 7th umbral calamity
so they tried to drop it onto eorzea
very fantasy like...i like it
basically, the flow of magic in the land was disrupted by bahamut, and has yet to recover, if it's ever going to
also im level 13
let me check the map
in coerthas?
i thought that was ice
charlie go zzz zzz zzz nom
so im doing sidequest
but yay im getting better
i think i'm like 11 or something
i been addicted lately
plus while my oc is model after me, there are slight and many differences. gummy belle is literally me
drago, those defence games are like league, how about you play a better game
yall want to hear something dumb though
i don't have a problem you have a problem
which makes it even weirder that the switch doesn't
as long as you are sub then you can play them
it's more the "subscription = games" part that bothers me than the "you don't get to keep them" part
well i already have online since the games i play require online
im editting a research video for english but im adding memes and im having way too much fun
you need to share the memes with us first
but my guest wasn’t bringina
apparently it was eyan...
aren’t the servers shut down as well?
probably
also sis i have a stupid question for you but don’t know how to word it
huh?
the only other thing would be visiting you for like a few days but idk if you can put up with my insanity nor would i be able to add that on my trip next year
also great news guys
which means my pokemon 3ds collection is complete
$532 however a good deal
is like $600
gums would do the same to me
work is done
sd card for switch
don’t like zelda but mario one is too expensive and i don’t need that much storage
it was like the best of deals
the character on the box has nothing to do with the card gums lol
it's pretty much decoration
demon lord
you proved me wrong
inb4 gummy plays pokemon drunk
i heard
he committed the biggest crime possible: he tried to get people to pay attention and vote
hence why i use open back headphones so i can hear my surroundings
earbuds suck
drago
i haven’t even touched it since i last used it
theres a bunch in the archived channels also
today is over
not for me
but minecraft is betyer
as well as massive variety with weapons
okay back
oh yeah journey's end update drops this weekend
i'm planning on playing that with eyan's group
but it should be fun
terraria seems to have more weapos than minecraft
that being said both can be stressful at times
or hunting for rare fish
i guess hunting for bugs and fish would be the most stressful part of it
also golden tools break btw
my fucking golden ore
plus you can carry around a workshop thing
then you don’t need to even go to the store
yeah i didn't expect that
granted i think he said the only reason was because everything was all ready
inb4 he does
though i am curious
like old days
i think most people would be just fine with that
true lol
those games are way more fun
i had a lot of fun with ultra sun though
and i would do it again
the problem was the events during ultra sun that happeend
yeah
unless bringina feels sick
i wouldn't want that
whos dumb idea was it to buy this?
i mean this is your first time capturing something that's not ds
and i have a hard time figuring it out because im lazy
but the second it works
so many things will happen
oh right
