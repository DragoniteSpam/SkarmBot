welp she left
i dont think she knows what a drago is though she just calls me bad boy and shakes her finger at me
what does that mean skarm?
welcome back
we've already had 2 since you left lol
the sun never sets on it
i wish i wasn't working all the time so i could hang out with you guys more often
lets get it
sounds like a real hoot
no quotes in that file!
ashbot is proto-skarm
he invokes his right to remain silent
since ash belongs to camelot
did i forget to save the autoreconnect thing
im pretty sure i only saved general anyway
im pretty sure i have logs somewhere though
some of your people are not cut from the finest wood
im not giving you money
this is my hiding place
will do
but they were in the original camelot
communism hmmm
fuck everythiing
it's drago's ghost
no dinner for you ash
how many roles can you attach to a user before discord starts to complain
i dont feel like making any more
okay master strangely msg me calling me a communist
nice
i replied with this
what's up ^w^
unless youre in grad school
are you in grad school
you rang
master told me he ban him
what about them
right i forgot to check that box
gummy, you and demonlord's opinion on the history behind wwii really helped
not really lol
so that might be good
oh yeah
welcome
now that is an issue
now germany in 30s was interesting
i ran around my living room with war music and this gun
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
im viking/irish
if rc were to be here, how much of a chance would he make you his rival?
all the random roles lol
okay that leaves rainy
have you ever seen deci in a place where he couldnt just swing the banhammer? he hates it
you have mods quitting on a daily basis
by definition the people who do the most talking are the majority
i thought he might be mature
helps me improve the server
okay hmm
she would say the same thing
im asking her
hey not everyone there sucks
i see people talk about this artiks person a lot but i have no idea who that is
i looked at chat and saw yanis and meant to say exilon
and a troll but a good person
sounds like a plan dragon man
make way for my sis!
gummy you have too many sisters
maybe every time someone says an arbitrary word like "epidermis" we could pretend to get all offended
and regal and ida
you know sometimes i think about where it all went wrong gummy
camelot had chuck buuilt
i sent him my video now that i finally posted it and he didnt say a word about the fails
get him to star in it
ash meet flubs and regal
i create nothing
this is a true friends server
im gonna be honest i dont like league lol
who else?
yeah that sucks, hope you can recover them
interesting
well you're not missing much
he's one of gummy's old friends
not like i care
do you want me to do it? lol
thanks
hows that?
ok, what role do you want
guys what should i draw? any suggestions? lol
thanks
p!join
*cant* 😦
p!play bokura
p!play wake up, get up, get out there
of all the states why ohio
p!play live and learn
i bought sis a plane ticket to switzerland
come on man show some respect
if he doesn’t and talks agaib
im giving him a chance
i think ida said he's chilled out a bit since two years ago
see you should have changed it to something more descriptive like "i have no friends so i try to attract attention by being inappropriate for no reason"
and drago let my staff handle him
also
open it up
the one below the graphics card
what?
if the other metal thing doesnt fit i guess
1*low profile pcie bracket (for smaller pcs)
i will sis
yeah
wait no its that dude
indeed theyre quite pretty
some zeal guy finally after like two years
that sounds dreadful in every sense of thw word
sis would be jan 5th 2017
demon lord yours is harder to pin point
keb-edge
all i remember was he told me not to date
now jello
i'm telling aqua you said xenoblade is confusing
oh...yeah that could do as well
i might actually fail
i old new york is coming back
also i mean no matter what i say, at the end of the day theyll accept the fact that my granddad said they shouldnt makes it final
i only take 0.5x fire though
wow..
walmartica
spiffing(?)
how the fuck do i load this thing?
you forgot the part where you put your boxers on your head and sing the alphabet song
alright new plan
this needs to be played in the background
and tell him that he's not going to get the help he needs by waltzing in and introducing himself by saying "i'm lonely"
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
someone posted a pic of a nude women with a horse dick in every channel
fuckin drago
wait we already have a troll here
theres like some weird love thing happening and its horrifying
my server will allow non bronies but if you post a meme shooting people
im being like harassed in university
the service there is crap
just not sure if i should still allow invites for everyone or not
"bite the powder, ram minie ball in, put on cap"
oh tb?
no got a babysitter for him
i think he would be too scared
oh my
nah i can train him to be tough
wouldn't he bark then?
lmao
i saw it but it was weird
eoghan says he wasnt drunk but i'm pretty sure he was
probably
now open the product?
i think that was the only zeal raid to ever happened
hes the nicest person in my family
most normal armies are armed with, you know, actual arms
"you think my handwriting is bad? well tell that to my raptor's face."
yes youd know it was him because that sentence confused me a lot
i had sidebox/sidebars
flubs is weird
fun fact the girl i asked out in high school is in that one for like 1/800,000th of a blurry frame
you better not!
i'd probalby root for her
yeah im the best at dancin
he looks like you
"so do you have any special skills?"
that's enough of that i think
sis im dying
my spare keyboard lights up
xenoblade is weird
i only see the gold one in the members list
i may be a bit tsundere
okay sis
it was seasoned with red seasoning salt
i'll make sure it finds a worthy home
is this the one that you paid like seventy dollars for
now stare at this
is she a cute single yellow dragon?
tell her to see a doctor
ahhh
would it surprise you guys if i told you i had a waifu?
unless you have a dirty mind and want it to mean something
gummy i'm revoking your permission to fantasize now
these days we rarely fight
wtf did this man do to get suspended...
my guts hate my guts
how should i know
because youtube ban has already been done by me, twitter by rc, so facebook is next
but eh
i like the trolls that are really witty about it or the ones that are beyond lazy as shit. the ones in the middle are the shitty ones
i should get my actual sister to join this server
well grandpa died which i dont really care about but made the rest of the family all pissy
tell me all about it
well since hes dead uncle george is now the oldest male in the family so he makes all the decisions and hes a dick
they actually didnt even ask
thats mike 1/5
uncle mike, whos only like 10 months younger
okay i think for once an emulator is a good idea for this
in anything really xd
but would be fun to play
oblivion
make each episode 10 mins long
the dating guy went crazy, did i tell you that?
or jello
no master did
good idea flubs
but anything can trigger him back
i mean i kinda help him get a girl only for the girl to go out with him for pity
vaguely
for dixie land!!!
what did you _think_ was going to happen gummy
im driving this guy to kill himself
master can i link your google doc homework thing or should i find something else
oh wait
lets make the world like equestria!!!
those sexy ass dolphins are going to destroy us all
and 32 hour work week
and takes all the power
guess whos a doctor now, bitches
imma go cut open someones brain and see what comes out
flubs i'm appointing you as sir ultra major badass marshall admiral viceroy grand duke chancellor king princess pope president prime minister c.e.o. buddha god governer shogun tzar cesar c.m.o führer, ph. d.
update: there was more brain inside
it hasnt for a while
show me
....okay
i'm 80% sure i was trying to delete something else and accidentally checked off some things i didn't intend because i looked up one day and half the series was gone and decided welp there's no point in keeping the rest of it around i guess
the supergummying era timeline is weird 2013-2016?? but the official official would be 2013-2019
then he deleted most of them
oh my
and im like shit
damn
thank god you are here
not that i'm complaining, mind you
is that good or bad
animal crossing might be my fav game
gummy you should go post spam in my comments it'd boost my seo probably
same
just low internet speed problems
it doesnt exist
but my internet speed's staying where it is
right skarm
must be stuck in the spam folder
yeah
you upload more than eyan these days
omg flubs
it was better editing than me
why do you of all people haev to be a dragon
that explains why you and i get along well
it looks the same
i added snow
twenty dollars an hour
but since we're friends i'll only charge you $19.50
oh so he worked correctly before but silently did nothing that time
oh you know im dead right?
but always remember the pat pat method
man somedays i need a break from the server
go ahead
you did great though
if you dont youll get burnt out and start to resent it
thats what makes them special
it'll be an assfire for everyone else
what video
i mean errr
no some offer it for free for one time use
no one heard me
gummy stop hitting on strangers
man some uni students are so cute
wanna check that gum?
so is the 2ds just like the newest version of the ds? because it looks like a normal ds
you can
flubs wanna replace bella/someone who is no longer present?
canada talk, university. i am attracted to a woman
iceland school work work school iceland. sheep something i think. gummy is a mess and i must fix him
well making any progress is an accomplishment
isnt that a kind of pig
hmm it's two in the morning i should think about sleep
guys shouldn't be allowed to play
non that's mostly kugal
also apparently the piano is a woman's instrument
how was math?
so you can meet the most famous youtuber and do a collab with him
wait till they find out im dating a trans woman
wtf?
i dont think those would
in general though total war beats animal crossing by a tiny bit
and your fave game is skyrim
nah my favorite game overall is dishonored
close but actually it would be mario galaxy
my favorite game uh
close enough
you should have
okay i would play that tbh
she knows my bday
fairly sure flubs actually got it right
what's the age limit on dream daddy
i'm not interested in the details thanks
welp
this is my hero
yea you're right
well if it's a day late then it won't miss it
his name is anthony?
there are a lot of people named anthony
something about her heading on the route to eterna forest where the screen turned black while she can hear audio only and then it went black and had weird text then took her to the ds screen
read the tex
so apparently there's a couple of new switch models in the works
see what young drago has to say
it was mostly in the chatbox
ida is always angry at me
remember the patreon thing
(kendall is my new new sister)
3 non blood
like weed cake?
be nice to toad dude
i would love to read what they said
i don't have early interactions with drago either
i still have skype logs on the old granny laptop but i dont feel like turning it on and searching for them
therefore you do something
no u
hey i sold those sharks for a total; of 45,000 bells
how rude!
only if you do my homework for me
wanna go drinking with me when i turn 19?
maybe i don't actually
make way for vortex!
epic
woah that was forever ago holy shit

i think i'm the 2nd oldest here
oh ash bot is kinda here vortex
again
lets invite someone even older
noooo
yes!!
was that ida
thats a sis thing

no thank you
wooooooooo
might as well drop this here while i'm here
and by a lot i mean 2 uploads lmao
also i just prefer twitch in general
if only i can stream better
stupid internet
drago your house is on fire
good because i'm cutting your salary mister
theres almost twelve thousand of them, have ufn wiwth that
flubs tell him he did!
now it qualifies as a work of art
toasty
with a friend 🤔
but he was young
i've heard fire emblem awakening is good, that's the only game i'd like to get at this point
i enjoyed that quite a bit
hmmm surprised you didn't say smash
might find that in stores
global warming yes
do any of the 2dses use the clamshell design
(╯°д°）╯︵ /(.□ .\\)
cute
sis gets my pc
the fireball fizzles out in your fingers, but the dragon's face is suddenly covered in dish-shaped scars
sure
2334 caster's spellbook giggles in the presence of other books
cast a spell on you to make you do my assignment for me
and make my twitter look good
why do you even want a banner when youre trying to get banned
no thanks
he died
didn't get pinged but saw this anyways
i mean he always seemed like a decent guy in chat
flubs
heres both
to teleport? sure
thanks
what did she end up picking?
okay he found out a few hours ago thank goodness
blade lord nayru
good job
superspamming
thats redundant kugal
there we go
as you can see
no? too bad here's the joke: my life
all pranks are good as long as they arent just "haha i lied to you"
the best gift you can give is your presence
aprons are for nerds, cool kids dont care if they get burning hot food on them
think of something
i only know all the lore and have watched and read the whole thing multiple times
gummy did
i'm sure our number of customers today was in the quadruple digits
thats oxymoronic
lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
im hiding in her closet
this was what i used before i got ban
i know i didn't make it
ohh kingcorphish made it
i personally didn't know the dude, but the main person that exposed him is a girl i been following for many years
now evidence has been put out and corphish has been hurt i know that for sure
that is floaty lady
<:pikasanta:516171795196542986>
he knew about one of the pedo
i haven't really watched his stuff but i know he gets along well with other let's players
you really aren't part of the pokemon community
hit him!
otherwise you would be talking to corphish
well back in the old days it was unintentional
how was that?
yes!
also tell them that people who are different than them are still people
do you know anyone from the south i want to try that it sounds exciting
bunni
gummy tell bunni that a pirate ship was born on jesus and tell me what she says
that gets truer by the day sadly
what you upgrade to?
i might make quiz later
tbh i know nothing about mlp
i just picked random ones so
wait you actually have a gun?
it was an accident
and how did you get mlp and equestria girls wrong?
like the supermarket runs out of juice or something
the night is young
kill me
i see
wait let me check
fried or roast?
samsung galaxy
yeet
they weren't in the original camelot though
yeah
errr
xeon
except for jeff
me because my tolerance for others is far lower than yours
that drama scarred everyone
no they don't have permission
so far patching things up has been going super well
twice
time to make lillie bot work
so flubs
god damn it
gummy stop hitting on fictional characters
you ever seen dora's tits my dude
come out with your hands in the air
fbi we have you completely surrounded
but pls pls tell me you know my favourite movie
e!kenobi
i think you meant to delete it or something
fucking hell
which i didnt include
i would not have guessed that
remember?
for me it isnt april yet so i cant make a joke
fucking micheal bay
what has zeal done?
camelot i decided to go easy
dammit got 4
i see
home at a totally normal hour
my waifu with...aj!!!
did i do your quiz yet?
put the bullet in the open end, press the button, it goes out the other end
thats fair
when you find out someone isn't someone you thought they were
also there are no rules here
honestly we are all mature enough to talk about politics and not post nsfw
actually i know she prob would be more shy irl
thats fair sis
what's forums
the guy with the birds
this one is blessed
yeah sis
iceland has the best equal rights
death penalty i have different opinions on
no drago
but my mom and i talk about it every day
gummy keep your pants on
the idea of splitting people into left and right sucks
don't know how i've kept my sanity
but the studios that made shriek
gummy i'll vote for you purely on the grounds of putting "and stuff" in your campaign slogan
she really fuck a bee
no no keep them off
she does not fuck the bee no thats just my head canon
flubs
thats true, but usa does have better stuff
alright
most of the time
alright sis is twilight, no argument about it, loves reading, strong leadership, prob could fly, and knows magic
flubs you are...hmmm
witness shoplifting while you are there
see how stupid i was
flubs i apologized for wanting you to burn
cause i remember bella being on both at the same time
i tried to self promote
see when people see dragon runes on my back they just assume there's already something wrong with me
why does she have like 7 axes in here
to paris!
but errr
flubs hates france
who was that person?
i decided to get a logo for my gummy jacket
alright
flubs you missed a raid
im the server troll here
he does sometimes get a little accidentally rude when talking with one of his buds thats a furry but thats because hes stupid
you know climate change
this is good
nevada
okay that ain't far
he likes pizza
sounds good
i use class for reddit
less cars and you aren't as pressure
our highways barely had anyone
btw go ahead and make anything you want on this server
left is this way < right?
flubs
the sun never sets in gummyland
im always tired
are you still going to be a history teacher?
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
yeah you got that big ol fish recently right
lets watch drago's videos
im rioting
i love the cold but its still not canada
well "work"
i have to find the electrical power needs of chicago
so yesterday i discovered the names of the player characters in pokémon sun and moon
i had thought they were just called sun and moon lol
what is it?
the black hole is very cool
yes!!
it's cute i guess
i mean its a hole. its black. what did people expect
are you calling my mom skinny
[4:27 pm] dragonite: it's fun when science people try to make numbers understandable to noobs```
wow thats like 8 zeroes
it's a sextillion meters which is hilarious in modern english
the spear wielder rarity is dressed like
how did it taste
just because im on social media and pretend to listen doesn’t mean i can’t get the job done
drago
i know she would win
so apparently there's gonna be another trg colosseum soon
aw shit
you taught him that trick
does that one even know what sex is? because its real hard  to do it through discord
i mean if you think about it life is an std, you put the thing in the thing and then the lady has a foreign body sucking the nutrients out of her blood for 9 months
i guess?
god i hate him even more
he finds out in the middle of the episode he isn't moving but doesn't tell his friends until the end
he takes the pokemon and was like "oh yeah guys im not moving" and giggles
sure why not
but that only ended up confusing eyan lol
people have a hard time understanding big numbers, they should just take the base-ten log of the vote total to make things easy for the noobs
cause if every vote is placed in the hat 3rd parties would have a greater chance with the hat than the current election system
or ancient city
define those
the fat kid
he makes funny joke right?
you remind me of the scot trainer
if that's the case then you're both edgy
hi edgy
actually maybe
we already memed the shit out of how they can repair the timeline
only angrier
also witcher is like 40 gigabytes so good luck me
actually don't answer that
never met a maltan.... maltese..... person from malta
i mean what
huh?
adopt me ida
why is it that my favourite sibling is also the only sibling besides my real sister that is embarrassed at most of my stupid activities?
thats what i meant
holy shit
hey im almost legal to drink
drinking ain’t always bad if you do it casually though unlike drugs
true
still not good for your liver and shit though. but yeah a glass of wine with dinner is much better than a gram of coke with dinner
helppp
sooo she is officially officially sibling material as well
wait what
any day
kids
it sucks and i hate it
gummy im getting bored of editing xenoblade, should i take a break and edit the thing im lets playing after that instead?>
wtf is this
still don't care for twitch tbh
but still, link should always remain a silent protagonist
idk man im bad with money
i don’t wanna get fired though
and more candy
i worked at a grocery store who lffered competitive wages and flexible hours and it was like "yeah, competitive and flexible for them"
i already staked a claim to his pizza
don't waste food
2 more months
had a foodgasm
micky d's doesnt take as long either but it's also not freshly made like a&w
never heard of them
dq, imo, is again, pretty ok
i wanna try it
how bad is it?
they put 150% more tomato sauce than what is recommended
this is where gummy looks up my school on google maps
i havent had them since like second grade
prob best drink for you anyways
i happen to live in the only state where gambling is legal
high heels are sports shoes you ever wear those shits?
besides i spend more money in walmart on transformers toys then casinos
random tunes ftw lol
probably less than 8 tb
but how else will you keep your butt smooth
or else no mor free pizza
in and out is trash
putting food in the microwave at 12:26 am wont wake everybody up, right
you did it first
blame my sis for not sharing with you
we wouldn't have technology if it weren't for them
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaa
this looks cool
that sounds like work
three is easy, it's just floor(tau*0.5)
you should mention how awesome your dog is
what in the name of flubs is shazam
i rounded up
i do on most weekdays
you knew her for years
because tomorrow most places are close
how i know this...well i did read the bible twice
what food?
its fucking bonkers
drum covers
my apartment to acquire food units
i thought agaravin was a guy....
lets quiz you
also the i was reading messages in your server from earlier and the way tenda just shut that person down is goddamn hilarious
wtf is this?
oh i know gareth is a girl
i only picked those 4 because wiki says they were related to mordred
also fate/ gareth was a girl
pepperoni
fairly sure agravain's a half brother on mother's side
i have a strong dislike for fire emblem these days
okay i'll eat it
imma viking now
....so that's what the app is called?
wooo got a reply!!!
it's one of those icelandic people things i guess
i find the fact that ida keeps getting asked about it funnier than the fact that the app actually exists
i also constantly get people replying with "cool" when i tell them i'm icelandic
it's on fire remember
rapidash would burn you
i havent played pokémon since i kick gummy's exfriend's butt with a shuckle last summer
ida did you even see the shuckle battle, my strategy was to just sit there and do nothing until she got mad and did something dumb
i havent done cocaine i think
you are legal
fuck
yeah but half the fun of drinking is im not supposed to. now that i can i just feel like my mom or something
yeah
not even heroin?
why did you check?
i guess we have a more colourful personality?
well it's fairly predictable tho
i thought for sure flubs was trying to beat my record back in zeal
i wouldnt be surprised
if you right click on a server
more than gummyland or less?
flubs is going upstate to yell at his relatives because apparently im not done with this shit yet
holy fuck why is the house so far north
wait who is taking you?
but if you show up now
so that's something lol
"fine, whatever, just go away"
you can't fuck it up
i dont remember ever watching a singe episode of that show
id rather not exercise the privilege for a while but what can you do
help
blitz is a fat boy
nice lol
i swear to god if i have another diarrhea attack
kinda sucks
what kind?
could be something else?
ask wolfram whats the answer to int (arctan )/x dx
8 or 9 year old me loved the shit out of transformer action figures
im starting a collection
im returning my toy today
returning a toy
i haven’t started finals yet. they’re week after next. my teachers just decided to give us a bunch of final projects
papers actually wanna make me stop existing
gross
oh drago
thats also taking time away from me since im researching
i got him down to $50
oh yeah gotta get the stream to work
nice
and a gummy hand
better gummy hands
fair enough
their slogan makes it seem like they arent
unless mcdonalds gets to them first
and my favourite walmart but also the furthest one
old people
that's where i do 90% of my grocery shopping
but not all the time
ok but why
because i like hugging you
then talk to my other sister kendall
i knew it
but maybe magfest 2021
witnesses?
am i good or what
im kinda scared but me too
that's exactly what i would expect
but first thing i wanna do in new york...
they replaced target with lowe's where i live
we had a target in town but now we dont
dirt bike racing
bucky got the short end of the stick though
why?
oh i was wrong, endgame isnt the end of phase 3. the next spiderman is now a part of phase 3. so black widow is probably the first of act 4
im anticipating getting fucked hard for it
we didnt eat a bite
says here pork should not be eaten pink
eh if i do then whatever
i swear im not racist
that always fixes something
do you like white chocolate then?
hmmmm
kappa
ok im done being a pain in the ass
maybe you can do it again for extra credit
i will ban him
i “hired” for free a person to make a website for my server wooo
that being said
two years ago
i actually wanted to rework that
yeah i knew that
i would but my mom dragged me to walmart
and asked for sex there
dont get me wrong, the server is still fuckin *weird* but not because of that
oh god someone get kugal the anatomically correct doll
my sister is in this server
tb's ex who i hate has offered to make me a website
what you mean to tell me is this lad got one girl, and then got a second
well kendall likes you, and she also wants to talk to ida but at the same time jokingly jealous of her
i have trouble remembering which brony is which
also a transgender
i just feel guilty for banning a depressed person
agreed
exactly
what kind of play would you have said yes to?
harmful to himself
and read young drago tweets
take the one past the shelf date
can we go to italy?
nooo
if you don’t die
things sure have changed
lol\
i thought go big or go home
sounds wholesome
don't mock me, mister
also yum. food
flubs you gotta watch sonic trailer
yes sis4
gotta be hip with the kids still amirite *dab*
i gotta go get a filling tomorrow
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
kugal that's like saying "my legs hurt, let's do an iron man"
they havent made me sick yet
give me some
why are you excited about seeing kugal in pain
oh and fries too
so i accidentally did this again
yea thats mean 😦
www.gummy.com

gummy out here spitting straight fucking fire lmao

i need to sleep off this burn
thanks
i can't believe my sis got addicted to this stuff
i was up all night dry heaving, gpt 2 hours of sleep, worst pain ever
$100 for chocolate?! is this switzerland?

canada is basically a state
you’re a state
not a lot of hard candy is good
for what?
i say tutor
i meant tutoree...?
if i cloned myself
hmm getting a job at ebgames....
maybe
im thinking about trying to apply
now im only making these things off games i have done before
gummy we are no longer friends
yes he is
i still have my yahoo email, its kinda crap but it was my first email and i still have important accounts built using it as an email
look it's not like i told him to do it
ready for this?
change your name
vivaldiblitz
kugals last name is nerd
drago you suck
maybe he meant phat
shut up
blitz is fat
y'know what?
yeah i went there
because thats how much i like having you around
it all goes to direct relief
thats for my collection!
that better?
only i'm allowed to kill my sister
i feel uncomfortable when you are bein so nice
i wouldn't even try smoking tho
wait why do when i search "mordred" in gifs there are a lot of animations of her without many clothes
even though yanis has the sexiest accent
now that is a nice pick
eh, not really
venice is garbage right
alright then
you should already be bowing yes
he likes pokemon drago
yes, my commandment is that all subjects shall be made to read danganronpa
he probably washed his face
i give my dog less than a fist sized bit of food every day and he finishes it like 1/2 the time
no she was already a weirdo
then broke one kinda
gummy i got 100 on todays history test are you proud of me
i second that
alright i think thats all im gonna say on that to not stir shit
classes get really passionate and those only have like 40 - 80 people as it is
we got to go home from school after just an hour
and it ended off with obama's presidency
we were not there for a terribly long time

i guess most of them were like drago you are a banana or whatever
so like
or is he the one that founded the usa
why not put it in a kids show?
😮 cupcakes!!!
i love gossiping
ohhh mb
i think kids tend to know about sexuality/feelings a lot earlier than people seem to realized
hes the worstest
looks good actually
bad pic but you get the point
i made a pony
then made it in human form
it would also be funny to have ida there babysitting us but that might be logistically more of a challenge
i only share cupckaes with cool people
same
jared did a bad
she was his ex wide
it ain't worth it
made a <#578002937544966145> channel
i dunno if he'd like traveling
going to have to remember that exists
i may dwell on here.
thats absurdly funny gummy
should i troll them?
he yells a lot
imagine being that full of confidence
hey im better
here
she died
anything i can help with?
it's been a rough few years for me
people currently active in zeal send their regards
pizza
there's only one.
i recommend shitting
it's my favorite from all 2d scroller ones.
it does in a way.
because it's very old and was used for several thousands of hours
nice.
i see.
only we two.
why aren’t you in gummyland today?
no about graduating
she refuses to watch with me
i tried
never
they post clop. it's disgusting.
nah sounds entertaining
guys
mjhvbjjkh
at driver
i feel so lied to
it cost me $120 just to take the exam
such bullshit
sis*
on duty
for some reason the idea of gummy being a shepherd is way funnier than the idea of ida being a shepherd
whichever
you wouldn't be entirely wrong gummy
one would say enough to drive you insane
plus i am clumsy and will end up hurting myself in a way
and also they were probably used to humans because they were owned by an old guy who was like "two euros and you can give them food and pet them for as long as you like"
hey maybe you can herd her bunny instead
i would do it
if you can come up with a more creative name
i didn't know
flubs name is steven
sis's name is charlotte
and also i sort of imagine he spent a lot of time smoking weed
nope the opposite actually
im trying to download this platinum emulator
brb shower probably
1.37 miles
ha no one calls me by real name
i dont think its going to be march, it's cold in march
running with a backpack on is very taxing
why are you bothering with whatever month is coming up
gummy is merciful.
gummy
120 fucking dollars
i dislike math personally.
dude good luck
hell yea
im trying to sleep
i want chipotle right now
even though never seen one
wish me luck
neither did i.
i want arbys
it looks like a butt
you need to try harder
flubs tonight
league of legends
shots fired
i think for everyones sake i need to not do that
too small
eat it
i gotta think of good math emotes then
star
no even a single star emote.
crispy chicken burger
and thats why minecraft is the best game ever created
i hate that show
ooo gummyland raid
can't remember her actually banning anyone, but ok.
i wish i'd remembered that trick during the recording but oh well
anyone from a raid.
flubs stop hitting on uni students
and thats made of atoms and shit
of course they are
i hate game of thrones
sooo when will walking dead end?
we're both made of atoms so sure
wow a lot will end in 2019
and what have you seen so far?
reason why is because he wants to stop cyberbullying....
i think i remember a disproportionate number of people being classic internet condescending pricks to him over something undoubtedly small
boom roasted!
gummy beat him to it so gummy gets the point
after you get this job done i can beat you up?
i suppose you could return an array or an object containing multiple values if you want
good!
have some more
you post a pizza picture then
gotta spice things up
noooo
how big?
"$1,000 pizza sold at nino’s restaurant in nyc features caviar, lobster"
sup my dude
god if my metabolism ever slowed down id be such a fatass
great
lol why is that even a roll
o k fine
now thats something i would do
darn
and it did nothing
sleep is proving to be more difficult
happened when i was in elementary school too
tbh i should sleep as well soon
ah, pavlovan conditioning
thats all i know
drago go sleep
fine lets explore the city instead
sup peeps
what do yall think of this picture of me
dark?
aww thans
yes that is my leg but thats irrelevent
watch it flubs
ayy 100 on my part 2 final for english
im talking a 45 second, big long yell. i cant even whisper that long
im bored flubs
only slightly less photon-black-hole-ish
flubs created the world
people are so dumb these days
i'm sure my mom must think that about me too
so my mom has had plenty of time to get used to it
when i wear shorts
6 more followers and if i can maintain 3 average views
because i asked my viewers my starter pokemon
her fiancee is michael from mandjtv
he apparently said to someone during a stream they should die a horrible death
she has work all week and weekend
i could be, for example, a gummy
lmfao
drago you are a gummy worm
the cane is only to be used for the betterment of society
but what do you expect from a guy that likes muskets?
and i dont know why i installed it in the first place
hmm i need to be in class in like ten minutes
you are wearing shorts*
origin is a bad launcher
i got 96 on the physics final woo
seems like my server now has a similar issue with that but instead of an account called the greatest, we have an account called “flippy”
makes flubs a milkshake
good after being sick
that might have been it
that's nice of you.
yea.
thats cute
drago
youtube crackin down on the channels that center around drama prolly lmao
i hate to say this because it's a very interesting system but i feel like socialblade isn't going to last regardless of what youtube does
i thought the same thing, gum.
hes not that crazy
so that's convenient
well i won't be leaving the resort, that's for sure
which is why i'm never buying bits or subscribing to anyone
and the culture on the site is so toxic and bleeds into so many other things
hey drag join freedom yet?
is to directly donate???
bits and subs
lets build a city for good purposes
but man these movies are so predictable
but amazon is cool
grossest thing in the internet is dragonite
maybe you dont
and they died because the new person died?
also demon lord
no this place isn't composed 30% of people who need to go out and see some sunshine
you could always have put it in the trash can
and then she left
yanis has conflict with you two sometimes
hes my everything etc etc
you never met yanis before drago
yeah thats floral to you
that's terrifying
babies
it gives me a headache
pay me
wait you're giving me an artist?
have fun with that
top kek.
kiddies
was the most i had
tonight i will stream for 10 secs at midnight
you gotta be careful of friction gummy
no yo udont
keep up with your strength
i see...
yay!
looooolll
but also good job
availability of stormy
but you should get a schedule. and a job. and friends. and other stuff
yes it does
it sucks and i hate it?
i’ll take that as an eh!
they're free in the us?
gummy banner is done
for watching ads
wanna help
those get around it. so you do still have to watch them
flubs can pick
all right..
flubs this is the worse time to sub to me
he cut school the day of the big math test
oh yeah hes a liar and a cheat
oh i made fake accounts on my forums
when ida and i had second accounts for the rp thread we'd go into the chatbox and yell at ourselves sometimes
unfortunately the logs from the chatbox dont exist anymore, there were some gems in there
you're terrible at everything?
right ida?
also guys i have to admit something...
fun fact sis not stormy is the person who can calm me down the fastest
becasue it'd ignite instantly
my banner has a reference to everything
better than your banner drago!
s is blue based on rarity's dress colour
no tiberia was me
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115>
isn't that worst?
yay!
kek.
which i need to make ding dongs joke
it's me, a boy
to the server of fun people
ooh canada boys
in _may_
and i only learned about it today
you spelled it right lol
my sleep schedule is jacked too
or however you spell that, i don't keep track of pokémon much these days xd
doing well besides feeling like i should be productive right now
convenience rocks
yeah i've never been on a trip like that before so it should be fun
last last summer i was *supposed* to travel, by car, to wisconsin but plans got cancelled and im still a travel virgin
im immortal
welp
flubs is a jock
anyone who dies is dumb
and flubs
or turpentine
fabulous
my sis protects gummy
i have no work!
i dont know code but sure
i tried
well we drove all the way to arkansas so i guess that kinda counts as going to a few states lol
im gonna attempts to stay up all night
i chased after a girl who was mean to me
how did you even find that
charlie knows how to make life hell for me
except he isnt really gentle, if he steps on your foot it fucking hurts
sure
drago
alright sounds cool
gummy i have my own anti-charlie bible
bye charlie!
how much are they actually
its cheaper to buy a pro controller then 2 joycons
$376 cad
it's a dinosaur
unless the graphics card is way underpowered and the botw people just did some insane black magic to make the game work. they probably did.
he nearly murdered my balls when he threw me a pack of mambas
of course that server becomes pretty active when i'm asleep.
yes.
he's gentle 95% of the time
im worried about this now
shit
mhmm
it's simpler
yes.
i like both but the second one pleases my brain more
remember the old days of camelot
i was?
it was you, master, and i
lets try to make this the golden age again
dont try to recreate what has passed
<:dan:579731005317971969>
theres people
i think drago and i need to roast each other more
thats attitude
well there we go
the rules are there are no rules
2 be nice
ugh i got a busy day tomorrow
i like how we're two days away from june and idaland still has snow
i don’t fully remember
i have a cool mnemonic to remember this kind of thing
if it is your mental state you are responsible for it. if it isn't you aren't
all the mods who well didn’t work or gone
youre not his mom
team up against him
i demand to be invited!
the shapes are bigger and closer
a what now?
will!
i like cookies and milk
the morning hours are an amazing time of introspective awakening
what's that
also this bus smells like piss
yummy
with the native americans
i forget why i got a 3ds xl instead of a 2ds xl
probably
he already hinted something if you are around his twitter, plus i can tell by the way he acts, he's borderline depressed
yeah i dug around his twitter
rainy and eyan have the most sixth-grader relationship ive ever seen and i love it
a lot
rawr
the one where i got accepted into rpm network when i was a senior in high school and then like a month later youtube was like hey, you dont need an mcn to be partnered anymore
sort of in the same way that having all of your legs amputated sounds fun
rainy and eyan seem to last
you shed a little bit of weight but on the other hand holy crap you dont have any more legs
someone told me to
because your skill is susceptible to breakage under immense force
i'm not dead :o lol
haven't streamed for a week rip lol
when's my birthday gummy? lol
ive had so many cats
*has no life* lol xd
me neither lol
yay!
yeah i think it took almost a week for my first emote but 2 or 3 days for my second one
i'mma be leaving the vc too.
i have 2 currently
ooh lol
heard worse lol
send link please? lol
they're totally not screenshots and stuff <:bsdderp:584676007664156675>
quote of the day in another server. you'll know when you see it lol
oooo
much better than chrome.
flubs you missed a big vc here yesterday
the one night i go to bed before midnight lol
welp reddit just died for me
i was probably asleep then lol
i love how rarely anyone promotes their stuff in this server
she has the personality to keep my stream alive
when this server is made for self promo
here is an example
a danganronpa character
everyone is gay
hey gummy wanna go out on friday?
it’s a good meme
even if you get one for free
wii had even more great games.
oh it also had mario mak - oh wait
which nobody played
because ive been too busy using my wii u as capture scaffolding for wii games
sounds like war music
so drago
there
i typed dragonitespam banner
gummy stop reading my notes
and my sis is on this server
i realized everyone that works for me is an asshole, an idiot, or a bootlicker
without question
because im amazing
milk expiring is like the death of a loved one you monster
or you put it on craigslist and ship them a brick with an image of your junk taped on it
well i want gummy relatives
sis nooo!
wanna actually be related to me sis? ~~i can hook you up with one of my french cousins~~
sooo the guy who looks like drago who is depressed showed me his prom pics
you know the one in zeal
i mean i did reach out to him back when he was really depressed back in zeal
sure i can wait
i dont want to deal with myself
yeah but he had memes in the way r/frenworld has memes
and like 1/3 of the population speaks english but the other 2/3 yell
no flubs that what gummy and i so
invite the uncle
go to sleep gummy. listen to ida.
well now someone has to use kissing booth then all channels will be used
superyummying.
very minimal amount of fat too
yea i don't either, i like a little because when you cook it it renders down and makes even juicier
what subjects?
all people are garbage
here i am still not even close lmao
welp need to get on pc first
and i didn't want her to see me angry like this
and if you sold mario 3d world with it you could probably get a fair bit
does this server need boosting?
only a few times
but i managed to take 100% of it
no drago
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115>
thought you own one
no my cpu isn’t twice
oh you know what maybe you can do this
well this server doesn’t have nitro people besides me and sis
kugal i will pay for your haircut if you do that
good job
im reading 50 shades of drago
either that or 49 pages of me crying and one of me masturbating *while* crying
drago
flubs i thought you never cry
oooh, ad astra looks sick af
send it here
i don’t want a new one since i will upgrade a lot next year
so that's the part of your brain that got retrofitted as a space to store extra calculus
oh you know what else i do?
i picture a piano to remember the difference between left and right
one time my mom accidentally put chocolate milk syrup on my waffles when she was on autopilot
let's go with acid
stress, some other issues, and i was soaking wet leaving my university today because it rained hard
like did you tell em your dog ate your hw
flubs what?
pc3-12800 ddr3 1600
drago is about to part with some first edition ddr100 ram and he doesnt even know it
no i mean no he cant have it
a very weird part of me wants to cut mine short
speaking of money i just paid a $360 fee to my college for calc 3
oh right
gummy why do you have a petri dish in a pizza box
i should do some research
but it’s giving me a stomachache
so did zeal server get boosted?
anyone wanna share these cookies and milk with me
did you finally buy one of those sheep from ida or something?
you don't need to, you already have a cool accent
they're yummy
it may work or it may fry my pc
nice!
the lady
probably more like 25, since it's not shiny and new, as if that matters for ram
also i feel like i didnt hear _anybody_ speculating about emile playing chrono trigger until like, three days ago
and beat drago in yt once again
like, the entirety of it
is that your sister?
some moron destroyed my gummyland poll
and they didnt invite me?
on twitter they were
i had it set to check ip
some of those bosses can be rough
and the year skyrim came out
well tell him to do them fast because im busy tonight
i'll bundle it with the ram
sis is watching this in the background knowing i lost too many brain cells
i like the top one too
kiddies
i thought that was just an urban legend
well shoot
though then drago took over
i havent done that since december
alright so this server is basically what i intended gummyland to be back then
that being said, feel free to invite who you want here, rules are strict but no nsfw pics and stuff, you can kinda talk about nsfw stuff depending on what it is but no pics
also no bullying people or swimming
if server changes name
i have to change everything
i just ignore them 9 times out of 10 so i miss most streams
listen flubs
guys
kugal let'
have you even _seen_ my posture
gummy youre hereby banned from your own land
can i have money
so heteromantic would be accurate
```[11:48 am] dragonite - guru of life: i had a dream that i was having a philosophical conversation with a girl i used to like and now i cant remember what the conversation was about```
or however you spell
talk to you weirdos later
interesting statistic: one in twelve people are born without a soul
ask my sis out
and congrats
someone get him hes getting away
i realize i'm probably just making this even worse for myself
youve streamed league?
gummy seems like he would be about 40% better to be around if you were completely fucking wasted
(っ◕‿◕)っ?
weirdly close to installing ffxiv
then it'll be 80
i should probably also re-install eso now that i have the hard drive space for it
my email is not in the system
nvm i forgot that one guy
the system requirements page says 40 gb though
i see
weird game
oh for god's sake
im making this gta 5
what nonsense is this
okay hold mouse to strafe, i can live with that
no drago
the seventh day starts on sunday and ends on saturday
alright
me too
but i have borderline ocd
looks like me playing dishonored 2 on minimum settings lmao
drago those are flubs’s panrs
god damn it sis
you humiliate yourself, i just laugh at the results
do you want my pc fried drago?
also the message didnt mention you by name did it
mission complete now to get food because im always hungry
nice.
how you know?
because that's what you always go for.
i love french fries.
i hate everything
i still cant get the image of superman's decked out rgb pc  out of my head whneever oyu mention it
its like something one of my dumbass cousins would buy lol
that is enough pc upgrades for this year hopefully
well a potato can generate electricity under certain circumstances
we're havin steak and roasted potatoes tonight hell yea
unless provoked
$224 for me
and i prefer the more general term "vegetable" thank you
flubs he's saying you dont get enough exercise
mmmmhmmmm
do any of you people know what im talking about in gummyland?
kendall and i aren't even watching the chat
it's whatever
i did not expect that answer
everything is whatever \:d
we should vc again soon
gummy get out of bed and go for a walk
fine i’ll do the get out of bed part
it's good for you
thats too much
so we don’t have a mailbox
well..
is that code
i rather mod flubs than him there
well the user account was from another country but still
is there a reason a disproportionate amount of bronies are batshit crazy?
i know a bunch who are normal
yeah thats probably a big part of it. also the internet makes people weirder so thats probably a factor
so i'm not exactly the perfect candidate
like _actually_ mad
he doesnt count he argued with _everyone_
long gone
gummy that was like two years ago you should probably let it go at some point
why not? its like zeal but without any of the annoying people like gummy drago and master
not all, but a bunch more than youd expect
~~ida you didn’t even wanna join in the first place~~
except rainy
he threaten me to many times
eh, i'm good
necro?
just you know more errr
explosive?
and probably sexist
won’t be a long stream but yeah
i just checked
my cou try sucks
but let's not get political
yeeeeeah
they can
there would just be consequences
plus jack dorsey apparently is mutual followers with a bunch of white supremecists so it's not like he wants to anyway
also fuck the romans
i feel like that would spark the renaissance faster though
as crazy as that is but yeah
gummy get out of bed and go play outside
and im really not, i just like streaming with my ex a lot
gummy how many youtube channels have you made now?
i have about 5 more
we don't need to, i got it handle
gummy the baboon must be studied
does yt not realize how long animation takes?
hmm bring sis in to chew him out then ban?
i doubt mods mind someone like that being banned
no not that
another one in my server got banned in manechat <:facehoof:241025290875174912>
```[2:48 pm] dragonite: free speech doesnt mean everybody else doesn't have the right to tell you to shut your pie hole```
i forgot
like time out chair or bad boy corner
lol drago
what opponents?
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
but what got him banned was
and what even is the whole unmotivated thing as abstruse locution what/
ahahaha
or why it's called taking a dump while you're leaving it behind
deeo
no one is seeing this
you think that's a lot?
yanis is great, but hes 15 so expect arrogance from him
>keeping you here a bit more because you're calling me "baby"
and the people doing mass shootings dont seem like the tolerant type who want a bunch of no good [insert minority] filling up their heaven
holy shit this server has never been this active since last year
and frencg
ask him if it was a straight pride rally, a milo rally or a kkk rally
this video is wonderful
like theres a 100% chance thats all he has to do today
i wanna know what a degenerate rally looks like in person but the more bodies show up the better it looks for _them,_ plus i wouldnt be caught dead at a kkk rally
i hate saying it
i mean ive had it but like its not like i do it every day xd
wait no thats fowl language
i don't like spices, i'm white
good one
its still not that bad
perhaps you are approaching this from the wrong angle
aren’t you that guy
so i did it
growing numb to pain is the shit my dude
🏓 🎾 🏓
oh the i and a are in the opposite order
the next session is scheduled for 4:30 so youd better hurry up
you missed some great quotes
bringina: "local dictator takes a part time job at cafe, villages hope they dont get poisoned"
whats the context even
im not an expert but i understand it. you cook it a bit then munch on it then digest it
but i dont know what the third one is
kugal don't be ridiculous
thats me when i lose my temper
but i usually flip something
guys
also the guy who threatened to kill mlp villains is banned for 3 months on manechat flubs
well it is very salty
since you say anything that doesn't seem right and get jumped on
a friend of my mom said i look friendly
i fuckin love just dance
leaving zeal
i was only in it for the convienence of not changing my muscle memory but i found a way around it without the random pings
thats probably what caused the stomach pains
demon lord, how big is the sun and moon, not ultra sun and moon aftergame?
alright i’ll see what i can prepare
i mean im the one who went through with it so yeah
quick and painful
gyro is my favorite character in all of manga to this day
worst is clearly slow and painful. its not fun
they fuckin dead
lots of guys like that are not nice
highly doubt it
this all started with vox and steven crowder
they _can_
and hateful stuff
though tbh...something about the old camelot days made it seem to be toxic
let's gang up on drago
i do gang up on myself
all in favour of getting rid of some channels/combining them?
i feel like self promotion and media should be combined
i guess media works for him
clear stuff up with stormy and hopefully be able to watch direct with her
time to **pun**ish him
kugal go to bed
blitz stop why beat me up? i was told you were nice over on this server
you should be
well i did take hm out on several pizza dates so
wow, amazing you'd go out of your way to compliment strangers, props for spreading positivity
that is not cute sorry dragon i gay so nude pics of men not my thing
hell yea
oh boy

because you want my money or you want me to talk

how so gummy?
i'm a bit surprised they're delaying it
i knew it will be a big game
new evolution not great but i obsessed with the new legendaries they my kin lol

then big movie
my pc doesnt need specs

stormy likes it and having stormy around is very nice plus i never played those games

i think that stupid crush on bella was what screwed me over
who took control over it?
i wonder if you even know him personally.
i dont think i've ever formally met him but good for him
it'd be different if you badgered him to do it
to be fair, to my knowledge, nearly 100% of people in here are your friend lol
that place is haunted for sure
theres fewer people and they are on average better
no jk
i just made my profile picture this in honor of pride month
plus i like the colors lol
also, all i did was ask why theres a d in fridge
"the other guy took more"
but mostly ace
but nope.
yay!
i had no wifi for like 5 minutes
what i miss?
i wouldn't really want to have sex with a man.
yeah it was no fun
are we human?
(depends)
oh finally
someone took control over it
stormy's outro today was funny
im just tighter with everyone here
you and stormy were bickering over what to stream
well yeah
talk to drago, he is there...i think
blitz do you blow?
its ok we've been on several pizza dates
going for walks is too tiring pretty much
i dont know if we're ready for that amount of beauty yet
plot twist flubs is a girl all along
he’s cool these days
new pic of him pls
i had this hung up my wall for a long time
(rest of the server besides flubs and blitz peeks in and says "yup, gummy lost his marbles")
it's basically cream soda with yellow food color
ida wanna play ffxiv yet
tbh it sounds like a scam
been busy
later on you start going to a lot of funerals
im cry at my chicken'a funeral
sad sure but not like crying sad
we have 14 chickens
dont tell my dad though
she just got so sick one weekend and it was time
u watch stephenplays? i knew i liked you
regal isn’t trust me
same
minecraft
prob asleep
mine is horrid
so ida lives in iceland and operates on new york time, and drago lives in new york time and operates on california time
guys guys
oh shit i just got it
i didnt know those wrist bands that absorb sweat are supposed to be used so you have em on your wrist so you can wipe your forehead until some tweet pointed it out
your face is a drago opinion on twitter
your pokemon thing
nani
new favorite flavor
i should be studying but im playing pokemon
was wondering if you were up for league?
good
ah lol
one of the best animated tv shows i've seen.
t!top
od horribly
which are made of math
lol yeah i remember first playing that game with my cousins
that was a good one
yanis is a good mod. he silences people and thats funny
drago is very consistent. very consistently weird.
ah, will added it. forgot she liked it.
fuck, ive been found out
are the stories referring to the same event?
hi star
even though it’s not against the rules
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115> <:revolver:582671595235966976>
nah most gens you can find plenty of pokemon or trade
black and white instead of trying to do that soft reboot should have picked only a hand full of popular pokemon from past gens
like pikachu
no fucking way in hell they should have tried that
"in the newest zelda game, link will be paid dlc released 6 months after launch"
honestly there are worse fates
i got things to do today
im still streaming
nice
lol flubs btw there was a crazy hippie at the beach the other day
i wanna be his friend
btw idk about you
he also had a crazy husky dog which was super aggressive and it was p-u-s-s-y
it was also named dracula or something close to that
nah man im asleep
sounds fun
i just broke my chair
well shit
gummy
😏 sexy
nothing you could ever eat tastes as good as being healthy feels, but eating tastes good now and health feels good in 6 months - 10 years
im playing zoe
gumym
accurate though, demon
me too, if i eat fast food i have bad poopoos
its the worst
its too much of a coincidence between all of the cultures that they all predict an afterlife for there not to be something
so everyone goes to hell since most religions need you to be of their religion to get into their heaven
what if all the afterlives are mixed together into one big one, but you need to meet all the criteria to get it?
if the two gods are equal gummy, that means i have all the power of humanity - one weird crippled guy
am not religious but take me to church is one of me favorite songs
dont need to be religious to be unhappy tho 😎
even 20 years ago it would've been social suicide to say something like that
im intrigued
im not fully sold but ill try it
hell, all of us could be wrong, it could be something none of us can fathom
why die tho
ok done with my duolingo
i would vouch for it
you were pretty deep in the closet, you said to me that same thing one time, that being gay is bad
go ahead
i dont think you should sterotype voices lol
im gonna head to bed fellas, have a good night
if you can das fine lol
welcome to my world
i'm 100% slavic.
flubs i will sue you
i mean i used to play csgo but i had to stop cuz everytime i got headshot and heard that noise i would begin to shake and shitit
i do that in bed silly
i bad at movies i try to finish it tonight maybe
ida i meant regal
can i be your third sister?
maybe
what was the other core subject
if i could find a mate who was also a math boi i would die
will do drago
good!
i too anti social for the pride parades lol
he's upping the pressure on me to get a girlfriend
tell him that you agree and think you should be enrolled in more math classes
i like it
(ida you didn’t have to point put the obvious)
no it isn't
there's a whole day to go
im pretty sure when that happens the game poofs out of existence
interesting
great well least it was free
at least i'll be making moola
shhh
iron_female
it’s actually a real thing
so what if others can see my nipples?
that's like asking a rock to be a rock
you look stoned
whoops
if kugal taped puppet eyes to his face would he be a googaley koogally?
lol xd
he's as tall as a skyscraper if not taller lol xd
even though it is one in the morning and bunny is probably sleep
that was my dad lmao
shouting is fine to an extent
oh yeah
made a new server and did it again
you are ambassador to gummyland here
lol it is
*thank* you
floral who knows tb is crazy
benny can be the cute little mop of anger
but she broke up with him since he said no to sex
thonk
it just broke
ive installed this app that my sister told me about that connects you to lgbt people and ive already got this 15 year old guy asking if we can be bfs lmao
get a room
it wasnt a dream, that how i spent my morning
sure
i mean if a nuclear war was gonna start its probably pakistan and india but besides that and the class imbalance its great
president flubs
go ahead
damn
pupper 💖
people are so interesting in their ways
went to specialist to learn i just need more fiber
oh no
that shit is disgusting
haaapppyyy birthhdaaay toooo youuuuuuu
then again, smile more, it looks good on you 😉
thanks for the idea kugal
okay gummy fine you can have a happy birthday. but not too happy.
thanks sis and drago
you are 22 and im 19

gummy

apple juice pls
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
hes like a young ida
right now drago
hes gone
im sorry for roasting you ida
youre a bad judge of character
like if i tell you that your servers economic policy is backwards and rooted in your personal bias, thats good advice. if i tell you to be taller because you look like a troll at your current height, thats bad advice
im so happy im on a new phone on a new plan
damn thats a good pup
im offering free hugs to all
nothing
i did it
but when i stream animal crossing, all a sudden new viewers join and talk
and beat them with nets
wait coke as in coca cola? or err.... cocaine?
only to be replaced by yanis
haters gon' hate hate hate hate hate
anyone who joins now will automatically get a role where they cannot embed links nor post pictures
hey you should all visit (remove the spaces)
discord me is open
plus link is in the description of eyan’s videos
you gotta fight benny for it
we should meditate on butts
that was bootiful
i expect it to be delivered before yesterday at noon
it's not tasty for me.
also the withdrawls can kill you
and a geek
im bored
i thought you did drago
it's raining
and all you have to do to move around in 3d space is multiply your current matrix with your updated transformation matrix!
drink with me drago
how fun
nocturnal emissions are fun
i talked on the phone for an hr and 13 minutes
then their products sucked
wiat
because its fabulous
it only has like 510 cameras
but yeah that'll be a bit later, gotta do a few things right now lol
gummy why i thought getting trolled was fun
here is the thing
it should.
wait, no, they already made dumb n dumber
mine!
drago, what do you have against ham?
oh yeah the bot does that
ham is good
i've been eaten.
shhh
who needs alcohol...when you got this
it's his favorite reason.
drago...no giving her ideas
gummy you missed the coin
then kill it
thonk
gummy keeps dying like a silly pants
when i did that stuff i was 16/17
i give dragos 1.1
i had the best league game ever
code blue
you know
the reason why i like you more is...you didn’t give me a death card for my bday
gummy wanna do my homework for me
you already have no pride.
eew get it off my screen
i meant dragonair
drago doesn’t get one
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
which server are you on? if you're logged in you should see it above the minimap.
feeling a tickle on your face and then wiping that spot with your hand to see it was an ant
no, it's subscription based
becuase that sounds fun
khajiit has wares, if you has the coin
sorry sis..
gummy how dare you not play video games
i just haven't gotten the time or commitment
flubs are you wet?
is that going to get me killed
lemme see if i can figure out how to put it on
like i can still walk around and stuff
i also happen to be following you around
btw kugal have you heard rainy's voice on stream yet?
well if he by some miracle starts making youtube videos again maybe i’ll watch
kugal is being generous with his pizza
i still like the streams though
just got done stuffing my face
my mom got me these chocolates where its these dark chocolates filled with caramel and its so yummy
nash
but you can even feel like shit when you stream!
for stream i can
we get along really well
got my new external harddrive set up
well pokefusion is trending on twitter and it’s terrifying
problem is..i don’t remember
drago sleep
im not even trying to now
i believe my mom was still a teenager when we landed on the moon
it's actually not, space is far too empty for there to be any reasonable chance of a direct hit from anything
see? qed, fools!
thats not a pokemon
point is something something honour something
don’t encourage this...
i gave you the purple i guess role
gummy can't kill you if you kill him first
helllp flubs
bye gummy, nice knowing you
well if your parents are bipedal and have arms, that probably means they're of the homo genus
both you are sis
no you smart
hey that was me last night
lucky you
i'll wake up at 6 pm
i feel bad for going to bed cause my hound won’t share but i have headache
i know right
well i going to try to go to bed now hopefully dogs are good
if i strangle you but only partially you might pass out
the ratio of the average cross-sectional distance and the perimeter of your arms is pi
but he likes being howled at!
i wish
mathematical hugs are just as great
and then i had work
or the delivery guy doesn’t steal my medical stuff or whatever happened to my last order
and a certain person should know what im doing
no stay dead
well at least it's probable that people will land on mars in our lifetimes
did you remove the punctuation?
flubs i know what you did
(sarcasm) lets get sis porn for her bday, she certainly won’t disown me and kill me
i want both.
well animal man showed up today
he has with me anyway
so it would be basically too tempting to use on gummy.
too much purple
at least according to my friends list
nothing screams fancy like deep fried potato
i feel a light buzz
it means your blood alcohol content is too low
nice
wow you revel
now time to hide my celebration drinking activities from sis
borrow drago’s microwave
and i’ll buy it off you
screw you
thank god i don
and no drago
that is?
but consider me
but yeah...walmart probably need to apply online
and far places that i can’t get to easily
you mean you'll get addicted?
streaming
asking for some....reasons
big balls for someone who pissed on the couch earlier today
i would hold a calculus text book like youre holdin a skyrim book
sure drago
but im gonna do...
bios?
we just finished
stormy will just tell me what to say
she sort of likes me the most
that's good to hear.
but if you want it that way then keep it becuase that's just my dumb opinion lmao
woah
i dont know if it actually saved me any time but it was fun to make right?
only if its scalding
because it sounds funny
who runs this server btw?
and i guess skarm
yeah star
floral's ex
but floral broke up with tb and went with his ex
i paid $200 for that
we need someone to stir up trouble
i think if he does do youtube it shouldnt be anything too ambitious or he might fall into that hole again of coming back at full power and then have no energy after a week
i should do a let's learn
it's a dnd joke but i think you might like it for the angry bun
your health is important
i meant in gummyland
idk what to think about it...
neat
videos will remain the same
might just re-record everything tbh
i went through another youtube crisis
a soft restart
so i get double the deaths!
oh i thought you did
ive had 2 wrong numbers call/text me today
(yes really)
lmao
trying to get my caregiver to text me wats in the food she left me cause it looks like beef and i don’t eat beef
yeah thats gangstery lol
for rarity it should be "darling i know u love me"
apparently not
i was thinking methanol but sure
yeah it’s a pain but there worth it ofc i have the new 2ds xl so i dunno about regular
now those strangers will know im smarter than them
“do you do outdoor activities”
you can though
ah rip lol
in fact ts real easy
not final fantasy
he wants porn
oh cool it's updating that's fun
which i hear is terrible to work at
ida am i allowed to play as a dragon in this game
drago it’s also almost 3 years of knowing each other
~~twitch streaming with gummy can be a job~~
i know
17-20
no one told me the 2ds xl needed that
er, exactly how does this "cast interrupted" thing work
or a silence even
im pretty proud of myself
hey some advice from adults needed
yay.
also don't let them make you feel guilty either
that happened with my first 3ds
or a lion man
don't die
i happen to know a thing or two about that from my own father
i'm good at taking care of my stuff i swear
drago stop breaking things
can i have it>
oh okay
i got $65 gamestop credit
flubs can i have it
fucking on thing i hate about 2ds xl and where you insert your game
well we already knew i was weird but now we know gummys 3ds peripherals are weird too
oh so you smack it on there and it charges it without annoying wires in the way?
bad food doesnt taste good
maybe 20
be weary
oh no then i can't have him, mom wants clean carpets
oh boy
im very excited
like sonic
cause i don’t use mods so i dunno what the problem is
alright
and now i having another issue let’s see if reinstalling works
you trickster
weary is probably the worst named emote of them all
my dad is disappointed in me becuase me and one of my female friends havent indulged in anything nsfw together
but you don't want to sword fight your non-romantic lady friends becasue thatd be too dangerous
duolingo has mommy issues
theyre making a fourth season this fall
did i say that
the gay reddit subs have such original names
i've heard some interesting stories about grindr on r/gaybros
i fell asleep
no not in the good way
lpt: lots of people in the exact same situation at christian events
i wanna play with you
any peeps alive
ida do i want to know
and someone had left a light pole in the middle of the walkway
well i couldnt watch it the minute it came out!
yup lmao
i not i just really confused
well
yes star
doesnt seem fair but sure
he wont have the courage to fight back
and he looks tough
but he acts tough
it got real quiet real fast
gummy you're already gold in my eyes
yeah
kinda
it’s a gay thing probably
she took the midnight train goin anywhere
im constantly in a weird mood

flubs that made me laugh way too hard
but that's what his dad spent all month doing

drago you never beat me up in the past
how can you throw a car, if you're so small a mini car is taller than you.
i know
oh thank god
drago hitting us with the absolute hot takes
drago you won’t like beans and shrimp
without watching eyan
sis’s name is mordred
i apparently have the number of maria now

it’s just spelt differently
there was an incident on ss forums where someone accidentally guessed my last name by shipping me with another user named "lord penguin"
i guess sis’s name

the bot says otherwise.
i don't want it

i vaguely remember the matrix math i did on my own accord a year ago
let me know if he’s like a good neighbor
lmaooo
ida why you do this to me

yeah totally didn’t mean to hit on you kugal
kugal in a blitz
ida your special gift will be delayed...
regal kugal and i just spent all of last night in the kissing booth i think youre going to have to try a little harder if you want to achieve tmi
regal was decidedly not in the kissing booth with us
kugal do you know any cute single dragon girls?
i must have been mad at him that day lol
there was one time when my dad got upset with me over not wanting to get the lion king on snes
i  back with fresh underwear
i know that feeling all too well having been raised by a single mother
getting out of bed is hard
i tried promoting my deviantart no biters
great one of the only surveys i qualify for money on breaks goodie
how do you search up users lol
im back again
lets see dis bootiful art of yours
lmao
you throwing me money drago?
lmao
oh nice
thats a cool ass name ngl
even sis is better at making fun of me
lion king
he must really hates it
me want to pet
i want it
nice
sorry regal :(
ew boobs
maybe you could try the crime of sharing cute puppy pictures everywhere without permission
king nappy fell
keep it classy, pokétubers
ask him if he prefers carbon, potassium or uranium
not 30
37.1
that's too rational of a number
you forgot we are missing someone
i miss him
i'm too busy being sad all the time to be mad
after windows update
gummy that sounds like a real good way to get her mad at you
drago you need an update as well
guess my parents we're just allergic?
cute.
let's go with 10 for now
sweet
regel guess how many gay youtubers im subbed to
tyler oakley
wouldnt the dude get lonely
youre only subbed to 30 people?
but anyway even if you dont get the original joke, the second joke is that i'm apparently using a girl's name on a business account
there now we have the three stooges role
so gummy should pipe down
in wonder how many words i've said in my life, and what percentile that puts me in for all of humanity
one girl two cups anyone
that's a star in some constellation somewhere that's probably going to explode when it dies
hmmm
haha yeah i dont want to slee
am i the only one who doesnt really care about the fireworks
sleep
west coast gang
yo debería
she's even more cultured than i am
aaaa
kk, nighty night
oh no
take it easy then
sorry sis that your other gift never happened
today kugal didnt have time to do gay stuff
hah nerd
some 60s thing
we know it's you.
kugal youre not allowed to not play video games
so the switch lite is coming out in september apparently
flubs will help me
free slurpee
tell us
can i have some?
why do you even want the meds though
and it's in a nice case
who wants to keep this place active?
i am sorta
flubs i just check my server
vaping is gross
do they still all hate each other?
it's a danganronpa reference
it's open, boiled, and in your hair
im here friendos
i can put it in the gutter in _half_ that time
is seeing how fast you can hurl a ten-pound mass
thats how i won against like 4 other people one time lmao
either that or i thought you would hate my guts
which is 14.3 mph
just in time for 2 years of knowing each other
it doesn’t matter guys
like the part where they're basically massive bugs?
shrimp!
we're just trained to be disgusted by bugs
but cattle isn't sustainable for the rest of the world to all eat at our rate
bison
dy/dx (e^x) ?
if it was a hot tub you could say it was a boiling pot of water with other people and people would start asking interesting questions
e^x * dx/dy
she is probably the best person to cut my hair
yea!
it opened yay lol ^w^
fluba
demon lord
i hear hes cool
so glad to have her back
kugal, i'll hang with you
flubs
nothing wrong with some cannibalism to start your day
you guys make my heart melt
happy 2 years of knowing each other
i can't
say what?>
gummy that's your morning routine
i got a haircut
it's fibus
that's one dang expensive box
i had pizza
ask drago
my brother likes pineapple actually
part of me is arguing with myself
skarm same
but i realized i'm not gonna feel better if i don't reach out
no thanks
and the offer on the hug still stands
the feel loving one, for example
i didnt have like a 4 hour dinner lmao
ya boy got a switch
oh jeez your anti-leaching off of her
gummy there was a scene in stranger things when lucas was like "max and i already broke up five times" and i thought of you immediately
he hates me
oh gummy i know the strat there
oh shush its her fault
which one is sarah?
flubs, buddy, you have _really_ bad luck when it comes to girlfriends
sure why not its a funny story
oh hai flubs
i guess everyone has their demons
no i did not kill her, this is not true this is bullshit. i did ***not***
i also didnt poison her
he likes shirts
i need to get in contact with your aunt immediately
needs more plaid
thats literally my entire outlook on life thanks for distilling my being into a single sentence. not gonna haunt me at night. nope
true
i don't think i'm qualified
the fuck
so how are you sis
maybe sis should train my staff...
you're not alone
tbh i think we'd all be a bit happier if it weren't for social media
thats good sis
"i halp"
gummy
but i thought you liked my math stuff?
this is certainly an eye opening experience
so i asked her whats wrong and she said her other ex bf threw a tantrum because she wanted to live stream with me over watching stuff with him
why is everyone on the internet a goddamn child
ok but if they arent dating why does he care what she does and why does she care what he thinks
idk but he only attacks when she and me are streaming
gummy how can you be so consistently smart and dumb like this at the same time
then we arent friends any more >:(
hey no nuking servers is my thing
gummy if you actually suspect there's going to be a physical confrontation contact the security desk and tell them
i can’t wait to meet drago at magfest
yeah, just not always great for _gummy_
i should show up to magfest but not say so, and then nobody would figure it out
top ten best pranks
it's for benny
drago. he does it
yeah but since hes finished a series
yeah but still. it seems like all the gears in this broken watch and stopped
i'm trying to find groups of computer people physically located \*somewhere in new jersey\* who i could go meet as part of the "making friends" part of finding a job
stop being old
ah yeah
flubs are you 7?
im 7 too
i'm a newborn plus or minus 23.8
drago looks like discount drago
who me?
last one was black & white 2
no one is at this age
me marrying ida sounds like a good way for me to get murdered by ida
same with flubs
im quite timid irl
flubs i wanna meet you as well
my dog is not the alcoholic in our relationship
looking at dc from an airplane, 15 minutes away from congress and the whitehouse are neglected neighborhoods that nobody wants to invest money into fixing. really says a lot about congress' activities
both go east to west and theyre exactly the same
google maps doesnt even give the parkway its numerical designation lmao
dont know
trains do not work
there's a relatively small county road which relatively minor construction began in 2015, was supposed to take a few months and finally finished in late 2017
no thats just a good idea
im not sure we're both about to find out
excuse you i _like_ doing 60 in the 65 zone
drivers here are slightly less horribl
im glad i was looking down at my phone or i prolly would've shat my pants
last week this semi truck came like 2 inches away from smushing my dad and i on the freeway
that seems like a weird case where you would use `me and my dad`
the rule is "if you would say `me` without `other person` it's `[other person] and me`, otherwise it's `i`
are basically the same
sorry for getting political there but yeah
we should abolish language
people tell me rust is fun to work with, and lately ive been talking to a guy who lives and breathes in haxe
since i have no idea what we're talking about, w
i mean i've got both those endings in nier automata, t was funnier though
really?
flubs you were weird before this
just hide it behind the big rock, nobody'll see it there probably
no we all know it's his rarity body pillow xd
or only with me because of money
maybe you need an older sis
i only have one sister and she's absolutely horrible.
flubs why is all my compliments offensive and my insults are non offensive?
drago why is it everytime you buy something, and then they announce better stuff?
good
brot
i'm died
skinny jeans are fabulous
this is like 4 keyboards in total in less than one year
yea i would say that's accurate
so kiddies
swimming in money sure is fun though
all i want right now is stormy
no flubs
like my viking sis
“gummy do you think about anything other than food?”
i don't know if i've ever been to baltimore
yay gummys a bully
this place is bully
how do you bully
flubs bully animal man
two girls one dude
damn camelot is making us all not violent
nobody is gonna fight back against the dude in a wheelchair, so i dont bully
you stayed the same
sis was violent
be specific
go boil your head
you can do it demon lord, demons are pretty violent.
actually i'm asexual so it doesn't really matter to me
that’s benny’s wrist
medicine can expire?
most of the time it won't do what it's intended to do, and depending on the compound it could introduce new unfortunate things
which was dumb in its own right
thanks drago
have fun with that i guess
no grenades or rocket launchers? amateurs
thanks kugal
you know what
this is me<:charlie:579566514248744963>
lmao
either way she did say one thing
exactly. its stable but extremely fucking chaotic
is that gummy's?
well reviews are mixed so i was just wondering
all in favour of inviting squid and rc?
skarm shut up
and drago don’t you put me down?
sigh
my name is supergummying
thats my name shut up
you calling drugs, meds makes sense
mason dope
also wait are the roots 0 -3 and -4? im very rusty with this stuff
i could probably find out what it is but she clearly doesn't want it out there so i won't try :p
didnt gummy also guess my name? i forget
i know right
but i cannot say it or i get beat up
paul
there was only like one class in high school i was in where there was another dan
it was a food class
gummy probably remembers who i'm referring to lol
yes i know
i know there was at least one tim hortons in rochester but i didn't have a car then and i wasn't about to get on my bike to go to fast food
although i suppose
i'm almost positive there's one in new jersey _somewhere_ but it sure isn't near me
flubs give me your waller
mine has the imperial legion symbol thingie on it, you can';t have it
mines just a brown leather thing from the 30s or something
oh you know what
anyone wanna join?
flubs i nominate you to be the next man on the moon
well i meant dan lol
hi sisters
my ffxiv character posing like a fate/stay night character
i deactivated my twitter a few days ago
mom: you brought them over because you wanted to wash them but didnt have a full load of laundry
me too
drago you can't date your siblings
mom: grandma, these are your pants that you left here
hey gummy i hear youre in the market for another sibling
the third party is you
according to both us and canadian law
time to retrieve it tomorrow
steak
oooh
i've got a question
eh i hit enter too early
pizza with a topping of steak. the fun part comes in that bits of steak are dropped onto the pizza as its being cooked so you never know if the next hit if meat will be brown, blue, pink, or almond
i'll share with drago since he's my date
flubs, buck you. i don't want to sleep, i want to stay awake.
flubs fuck you
im not dating gummy im dating kugal
you know it
im back with my steak
parents came remember
look it's not my fault you never learned the days of the week
<#542153256898658319>
how do you know if a bar is gay or not? did you see it making out with another bar?
hehe
mondays don't exist
i don't know why you're going but i've been through similar experiences since i was a kid
<:wat:579563576914870333>
i dont know if that would actually make you feel better or not
and this is where bad luck starts
which is also missing the shift key
my keyboard is so cheap but i love it
depends on whether you plug it into the port next to the heat sink or not
>there's already that thing added?
no problemo friendo
that or we just made the volcanoes angry
volcanoes are human enthusiasts confirmed
how do you know master?
shit
after gummy dies, i take dips on his pc!
sis gets that as well
thanks.
i will try out that windirstat program.
that thing
any glasses you wear are your cute glasses kugals
thanks flubs
no risk, no obligation, no red tape, no down payment
i got my debit card today pog
should also probably get a stock market account set up and invest once the next correction hits
even though she let us go early
y'all are lit
i've only got an interest checking and a money market account
get drago to put it out
why the ***fuck*** am i green
you better not
right now i am working on bringing the server to a staple 200
sounds lit
i mean, i might leave the computer, but discord will still be on
animal\_man\_
sis you need a new laptop
i prefer dixie land though
and that is lincoln's fave song
you're lit, gummy!
damn it
and cooking mama
interesting
omg that looks exactly like my cat
try that
even on windows
nothing crazy there, everything in the order of operations makes sense
f30252
good
no, it was a schutzstaffel office.
but yeah he was very lively
― isaac asimov
so hi bitches
now ive heard of george carlin
but i wont
thats starlight
really
best description of punic wars ever
i did update
fen can be a brosister
gummy, you know what you gotta do.
but we're all very homo
it was random really lol
you same age as me cool
tmnt?
you know i realize it's probably on github
to be fair i wouldn’t mind some hand holding action
i'm like 95% sure the mets are going to lose
he’s won’t eat him
i mean i get the part where a solid half of all games are derivatives of ping pong
how awful
oh hell yeah
im only in gamemaker and letsplay and a couple others that only get like one post a day like pokemonrmxp and stuff
okay fine i'll make them take a bath
im like a very pale white on a good day
shes plotting to take over gummyland once and for all
oh jeez sorry about the spoilers then
it’s that time of the week again where i question how well i am as a server owner
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115>
i just worked opening to closing
how many hours is that? :|
master i finished up the kepler thingy no one took up the offer before i finished the lesson feelsbadman lol
the bad news: mom's phone decided to bug out so they can't scan our tickets to let us in
the good news: today is mr met on the moon day at citi field and they still have some left when we arrived
welcome to the future
i figured out how to make my ffxiv character read
/r/brandnewsentence
it's the max level
but now it has confirm to also be ending
go skydiving, try some meth, see a play
awesome
we got pizza yus
yesssss
it's 2019 after all
everything drago does is fun and good (:
be both
switch forever?
because eyan thought it was confusing
drago went to an alternate universe
the green or yelow?
there is now rgb
hmmm
thonk
cause you are constantly tired so i gotta keep you away
apparently i'd manage to get int
get better flubs
is that an `and` or `or`
gummy i had an opportunity to give you a war cry
no i meant thanks
and then she killed me again
not even the || redacted ||
since i don't do the whole betray people very well
since they do it too much
what me?
speaking of which i havent played that in a while
wait no
fine i will download it now
oh my god yes
the third joke is that i'm too uncreative to come up with more than one fictional name in my life
thanks sis
which still lets you try all of the classes
commentary
iirc i have fire, ice and one that i don't really know what is for
gummy you sure you dont want to commentate? i wanna hear _your_ voice
<a:a_wild_gremlin:590514192507994132>
it's `ex`, from _that_ stage
basically my ex told me not to be stupid in front of her sister which is like ida and me, they aren't actually blood related
im gonna call it that from now on cos i like that name a lot more
hacker yes
gotcha
gummy forcing me to be social
<:ponkohyouknow:525081375888506883>
<:pinkie_awkward_smile:636655055134785558>
i deny all allegations of attempting to give bringina chocolate with hot sauce and hot mustard
i'm just showing
chicken? extra no.
also some vandalized the first nations university
oh you don’t like chicken
wow im dumb
but point is to not act stupid
well mitch we should see if we can drag tenda in
e!bot
like gums when he was young
“young people in vietnam continue to be taught at home and at school that same-sex attraction is a “disease” and a “mental illness” that can be cured and treated, despite legislation designed to support and protect lgbtq+ rights.”
lets switch for a day then flubs
he is expected to make it through to summer
but vietnam
yeah
what
3. don't invade russia at all unless you can conquer siberia before october starts
kugal you should probably play the kingdom rush games too
ask sis
forgot to do that lately
but 90% of them are great updates
okay
he only has like 45k subs
what the hell is a binomial?
if your pokémon series is binomial or higher i'm not interested
gums with bringy and with tenda lurking around
thanks flubs
who?
216 questions lets go
then i learned where poland was and thought "oh that explains why it gets invaded by russia so often"
jeans look nice though
and i didn't realize there was a middle ground
the two will connect together after destroying poland
that's like saying sparta survived till today, implying they were still a self sufficient city state
in some cases the epic covers are just completely unmodified
most of my history comes from the bean people over at extra credits
so how were athenians on equality?
that'd make tug-o-war more interesting
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
then fucked thwm right back when they were weak
ouch
$47 in total for gas
so probably
i always get a new followers
i take it someone didnt make it through
i bet they were called the dark ages because it was before they'd invented the light bulb
gummy told me u hate anime
nor have i had a mood swing
yeah ive watched heroaca. fell off with the latest season bc it didnt interest me but enjoyed it up to that
its pretty light on the moaning which is nice
i've made some mha oc concepts
real name: something japanese 
not like roman slaves or something like that
status: deceased
age: 41
and that had button issues
you rang
name a more iconic duo
e!crash -f
alright
i just rolled two critical fails in a row in dnd
e!bot
so me
i like how im maybe and drago is just a flat no
no he is nice
so here is my latest commissionb
oh drago
is this true?
diego might
i have finalized the most important development in the history of let's plays
is diego even still in here?
cant you filter by event like "join / leave," "nick change," etc though?
joins and leaves don't appear
welp
it circulated a while ago
and they are not allowed to join voice call
it doesn’t
my log bot records all joins and leave
we do
but this would be the first time he's uploaded since discord became a thing
ah yeah
and the last thing i want is sis being pissed off
you are either on her soft side or not
us being a pony server targets a lot of raiders
oh two more as well
that messed them up
drago very simple, edgy 16 year old
banned 3 already
i also dont think we have chick fil a
what did you think though?
be super super nice to regulars or new nice people
anyone living in wyoming
that is wondeful
make trudeau buy the entire usa
make a joke
with*
make a joke!
mitch im disgusted
20% was not filler in johto
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
guys
male feminists are basically people that support women or something
that series has been running for 25 weeks and youre just now realizing that?
we dont have food
im in the library
guys
im going to play so much of that gme
7 years ago
why do you have lewd art of your oc
hopefully it captures the charm of the originals well
i assume you let it off in the woods on friday, let it bounce around randomly for two days and pick it up again on sunday
you just rapidly oscillate the muscles that contract and expand a limb. i can do that for short periods of time with my left arm before it starts hurting.
too bad see ya in heaven, loser
is it incest though?
see? new,
do not answer that
you seem to mellow down
cause flubs not gonna lie
that doesn't mean i'm omniscient
these days it’s “thats gummy to you”
but i was joking, no one can know everything
i have no clue what that word means sis
but only for knowledge
i dont know that
why do you want us to be mad at you
i wish he'd go away, yeah
trump is a literal stool sample
so i'm not 100% sure if there were any winners in that debate
sis sleep
gummy thanks for dropping the animal crossing direct, i'm super excited for the game 😄
damn it sis
they don't represent the diversity of the country at all
bringina, if you love your island, don't do it
best friends is a stupid concept
mine abandoned me really dramatically, does that count?
no clue
what the heck i never knew he was a pervert
idk that seems pretty dramatic
best friends exist?
well i can name a place or two thatd be better than others
flubs you break something
flubs
how sweet
<:ponkglock:644266129925341197>
i got you a new pet
i had no time this morning to make breakfast
i know he would xd
galarian transgender pokemon yessss
lol as long as it works that's all that matters to me
rip my social life when animal crossing comes out that is if i can get it day 1
my favorite part of the night was making gummy suffer with pokemon black and white
wrong channel, whoops
make a youtube series about it
and yea pretty much, and i dont wanna have that shit spread lmao cos it just exposes how fucked my family situation is lol
how old are you sis?
so more like not very surprising but also im a bystander watching all this drama go down and i can't help but find it the least bit amusing
well
headset advice
guys
it's easy
<:mordredthink:561981371279605771>
what
i'm already yellow
thats the one
remember when i said a broken clock is right twice a day? that applies to uberfacts as well
what you mean?
i think it looks interesting
which are real words
and how dare my influence isn’t working?
ah my food expert here
basically in simple terms: peanut butter, banana, and bacon milkshake
no demon lord
gummy where on earth did you even find that
magic drago
so you have chosen.... death.
"always manage your textures properly. you don't want to end up like that guy, do you?"
i just played games when my parents let me
hasn't been a good week for cats it seems
really confused about why the a button is only working in specific places though
guys
sounds similar to me when i was 10ish
through naruto?
then i started to make accounts when i was 11ish
yes, through naruto fanfiction. "huh, naruto x sasuke... oh two guys can be together? thats new, okay"
that's a skill you should probably put on your resume or something
because sis, why be ashamed of it? yeah it was stupid but if you think negative about it, it’s not gonna make you happy
think im going through a mini midlife crisis
that makes no sense
though some animal crossing and pokemon are making my life less boring
you rang
and gummy, im sure you'll figure it out soon
and this might be ego ish
tbh i hate studying
out of how many he finished?
you would be correct on that 😂
it isn’t
i already doubt my ability to sleep
some crafting maybe
it sounds confusing
i'm fairly cheap too
the crystal tower series is at level 50, unlocked after the credits roll
psyduck is like pls help
yes sis
though i did promise nightshade an oc
i should actually get to work on that
get amd
fairly sure the 3600 actually draws less power than my current cpu too
a plushie of the pony oc made for me
i been studying some of them sis
or a sympathy discount
i was told to add a crown
and it does imo
butter oil
butter is better imo
thats kinda just an issue. if you dont care about presentation or one half being too cold, you could always chop it at the divide and cook the bad end some more
fun thought experiment though
a broken clock usually just refers to one where the batteries died
did you get banned again?
you mean dangaropa?
sure why not
1080p and hd?
i remember that
so then was the way of teaching the kids just the parents undermining what the other one says?
he tells me
because he said if they were, then why can't we see them
hey my dad told me to do that
and climate change cant be real bc the earth isnt real
but says trump will crush them
> and dinosaurs are made up
me too
there have been people who made up dinos to become famous but those generally get uncovered as frauds and they're also violating dig site rules
to be fair even the short ones
i just read his status thing
i don't think i would be against msnbc sacking him
ohh my stomach
healthy
there are several possible responses i can think of this this conversation and they're all awful
im not sick to where i cannot work
besides new horizons, what should i get, i can only choose one. new super mario bros u deluxe, super mario maker 2, pokemon sword/shield, mario kart 8, pokemon mystery dungeon dx
i don’t sadly
yeah mario maker is a much better value for money than new super mario bros. u
and there's an unlimited amount of it in mario maker
drago is main protagonist
i was the protagonist who stayed whole to nap
they still can't even pass the green new deal in congress let alone something like that
god why do we suck
bread and circus
no i think my dad is still enjoying it
huh guess it's the alternative spelling so it was spelled right
gummy calm down at least you don't have an orange man who gropes woman as president
if russia ended i'd be pretty happy
by ending
japan culture is better than america
just look at japan after world war ii and japan today
i do believe shinzo abe is liberal
i say dx or sword and shield
i dare donald trump to do that
i would do that
references: am chinese
schutzstaffel office
imagine trump dressing up as mario lol
since canada police arrested many today
of course if he does win we'd continue to tradition of collecting one of every kind of president
some right is needed
i don't really see any point to the right
what are u gonna do cavity search everyone that comes in
i have a feeling obama would have done that if you asked him nicely
borders would have done nothing to help
no the last major terrorist attack was by a white guy with an ar-15
so turn the darn thing around halfway through
i remember in 2016 when he dressed up as mario during the summer olympics closing cermony lol
what are those reasons?
pick a mass shooting, any mass shooting :(
crazy part is people would prob accept an american monarchy
jeff van drew: lemme switch parties because it would get me elected
just live in the pokemon center only problem is that's considered illegal
just left zeal
i was pissed but not at anyone
people in zeal gettin gyou down?
the one thing he hasn't tried to actively dismantle
and those tax cuts trump passed have not in any way helped the middle class like he claims
no gummy but there is massive game stores
god damn it now someone's going to have to destroy that also
because "don't be annoying" isn't a rule on the books, as you might have noticed
also drago
drago i will destroy your channel!
i went to catholic elementary and middle school, we had religion class
alternately: sufficient, enough
it was a public school with no religion
so im used to their names from the cartoons
i don't think i would recommend doing it right now
do this to charlie
oh my god
i think i have a picture of charlie out and about in the snow just getting covered up
watch this one
the internet was a mistake
ngl sometimes i do wish pokémon was still a small ("small") game made by a team of 30 people
ok so you're echoing me basically
it's a benedict cumberbatch photoshopped image i think
humans generally lay on their backs to make it more like a shit chair if anything
shush mitch
he fuckin flipped it on me
that's not an option, it has to be one or the other
...out the butt?
no, who is gummyv
ok fine
get mitch to
so i know how to use it for 3d graphics and i know (kind of) how to do it, but i don't exactly see the actual connection between matrix math and 3d graphics
gummy i want that thing to burn, and when it's done burning i want the ashes to burn
gummy it's you versus literally the entire rest of the planet
there you are
only thing i'm prob gonna hate about sinnoh remakes is i'm gonna have to constantly look at what pokemon to catch to use as a hm slave lol
that is my plan to pick piplup as my starter and gummy is prob gonna mop the floor with me cause he felt like flexing that he's beaten the game 10 times lol
no both
i feel like the surf replacement in swsh should have killed the user instantly
hey man i expected if people wanted to be horny theyd play zelda but a friend showed me some disturbing stuff recently that proved me wrong. they still play pokemon.
on vhs
itd be so easy to remember
i always have to have one open whenever i do raids
someone prob has the brain of a math god while also knowing all the pokemon type advantages and disadvantages while also knowing how to speak a million languages
i mean i know all of th epoké.mon matchups, i just dont do the other things
bringina you have my full support on this mission
isnt rotom like every type or something
if it's not gonna be sanders the next best choice would have to be biden
biden has to win south carolina if he's gonna get that far though, not to mention super tuesday
is he the one where theres the audio file of him asking for pants with more dick room
mostly just boring stuff
give that audio a listen. really intriguing
kugal wanna talk about matrix multiplication?
i love birbs
piplup is a bigger bitch though
can i buy drugs from you?
actually i take back my statement on not viewing any of the conventions in 2016 cause i remember trump's current lawyer was pretty much hyping up the crowd
a gummy and bringina destroying a country movie
um aggressiveness...
lets all move to errr
gummy let's meet up and eat some hot wings
tom nook for president
and then i said "ah yes, because c stands for 'can't create cool complicated conversations (with other students but sorry i couldn't come up with more words that start with c)'"
the teacher told us to choose from the answer choices a or b
how dare you!
once it gets to 100k infected we can officially use this plagues inc style map
im in position
this virus reminds me of the black death
we only learned recently that rat fleas were the reason, didn't we?
they believe it started in china where rats would then infect traders who would trade with europeans
fuck
hello my fellow gamer
see what happens
idk who that is
our usa president everyone
is getting people to buy his bullshit
sis you are a noob
bring back the monarchy!
japan elections go by so quick your like nani
its all about theater here
although the usa doesn't really have an official one
last time people were lining up and walking to canada
i say let them all freeze
can i trade myself in?
also my headset arrived today
but i like sword
i meant june 2019
and mitch
i don’t want the switch
i’ll take flubs with me
no one knows what that means...?
i meant friday
yeah gummy cant stop time
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
oh she is cute
damn it, she says don’t come to russia, but i always wanted to see the russian empire
flubs no
yea agreed. however his justification for doing it that way was that he teaches like 6 courses a semester, and his hw pile is ginormous, and he's 60 and he's getting more tired as time rolls on
no come back i didnt mean it
but mitch
idk theyll probably announce it at e3 or something
oh seems like corphish is heading to e3
hey gummy are you looking forward to april fools day this year?
cause corphish
look at his motherboard
build it
i knew him when he had 55 and was annoying :p
lmfao, i'd totally do that proof though
it definitely works like that
stop being almost 20
i gotta add y'all on switch lol
same thing for vice president then?
yeah so are 320,000,000 other americans
and i feel like i heard there are different ways to make an rng so theyre all different
see thing is a lot of americans wont understand that so it wont be implemented. new things have to be easy and similar to old things or they wont be liked
oh right
ash for president
though once again i don't take this family/sibling/twin thing seriously unless it's sis
im almost 20
and sis would be disappointed i bs an answer about icelandic canadians
100% sure kiss ain't a skullkidfan thing prank cause she did a face reveal last night
and i have to take a canadian history
he's seeding the lottery with the social security number of the previous winner
and i already hit puberty by that vid
or even actual person
then the sinnoh fandom will be sad
i will burn you and the turtle
i see
get me into this chat room
drago
i cant even tell if gummy is being serious or not at this point
i love this show
i see
usually the insults are worse
he can smite people at will but not viruses
but gums doesn’t wanna make mood bad
sounds like an idea
austria*
gummy what did you do
italy it ww2 is just sad, austria was jerks i thinj
i mean ww1 was bound to happened because tensions
i like this music
but at 6 am
drop things?
i can't sleep because i'm in pain
i'm sipping some tea rn
after 3-4 years drago
pokemon moon is helping me a bit with ptsd and my mid life crisis
too bad i don’t have the vids anymore
it's about robot butts with a side of post-human existential dread and light hack-and-slash mechanics
gummy you have an interetsing concept of "effort"
if anyone meaning prob just demon lord wondering about stream
sylveon is bad and should feel bad
nier automata is about butts
pokemon has been cancelled due to bringina feeling a bit ill
her husband came after me
yeah
cause fnatic
won't be there today, this has been a week from hell and i just need it to be over
i see
the consequences without the fun
oh nice
1990: kids screaming at the video games
he even said that this is his 10 times saying that
he speaks javascript
brb trying something on kelly
so once they run out of kat capture cards
good gummy
gummy your traffic lights are tilted
and im at work so im not texting and driving
they're fun if you're the one wielding them
never dealth with ruby either
a darn book
your life is to be around gummy like everyone else
also brb
can probably pilfer textures from existing things though
how long do you recommend
also that new guy in zeal has died already, no surprise there
and then learning shit through days at his office
how many men must fail for every buffet to succeed
whats the lowest i can invest?
it's also going to be in free fall for a little while, so don't buy anything now
good answer kugal cant have them knowing about our dish sessions
i am
me too
im an adult
and it'll be awkward
ah, double standards
my bf and i are in a server with her and she always makes us feel bad for interacting together because we're forcing others to "third wheel" yet when she interacts with her bf in there it's 100% fine
it's never a good idea mentally to wait if someone is getting to you, i realize it may be awkward at grad but you gotta think about you're feeling right now
buuny needs his happy meal
i think i will
oh it’s a she
delightful person
gasp
i left zeal
seems like gumland makes you happy then
this server, though i cant talk here a much, still makes me super happy
okay i feel like shit after that chug
i will do this 100%
cause gums smart with server
im pretty sure people enjoy the political talk and news
politics is just a great source of entertainment
i am a monarchist, thats no joke
how far did you get?
i love partial derivatives
you can go by the form in the channel description or you can go through the full 100 axis
i am a god in a world of ants
the great thing is that when chaos comes everyone thinks they'll be the king on top and welcome it for that
no master
i will start a diamond and pearl walkthrough
wonder how long it would take u to finish x or y in a day
wait you can watch me
the store used to be less horny
yeah but not in this sad of a manner jesus christ
im alone a lot but i feel surrounded by lovely people
save some of it for the rest of us jeez
i didnt realize other people got to weigh in on that
but i think thats against the rules
see that was always my theory about heaven
yes sis, right away sis
sis why are you up?!
i think my favorite things so far was learning about linear independence and invertible matrices, and theorems for determinants
fuck
do homework early?
here is my friend's doggo again, riley, cosplaying as a bun
i knew it was fake
also even though i lean left, i don't like bernie sanders and while he would definitely be better than trump, i don't think he deserves to be president
ida when i say young i mean "not my grandma's age"
then we would know your full name lol
bloomberg might be the worse one nvm
yes sis...
i think most people would
well i do have an exam starting in 7 hours
i mean in terms of running cause he may want to after trying in 16
you and god must have some connection
i did something stupid
i know
alright?
now im sitting in pain
walmart is whatever though
co worker died
i liked pete until he started roasting people for no reason
the only woman to hold office in canada is crazy as fuck
regardless if it's biden or sanders, i think they would be smart to pick kamala harris
and in bernie's case it may be good for him to have a more moderate running mate
i guess punch, not kick. but you get the spirit
i don't see trump changing vice presidents
because it's 7:46 pm
glad i could help :\)
he destroyed them. oh god
they should just give it back to cartoon network
drago, how?
wait i wanna hear lewd joke
we should probably stop talking about skarm now
how the fuck do they poo
or imaginary
more training is needed
that
i don't think putin can run next election
theyre the bits inside the dangly thing beneath the dong
what if youre the new guy?
that's my hope anyway
science!
because i do
first off, the one you'll come to know during your travels around limsa lominsa
flubs ask drago
y'shtola rhul
papalymo's the brains of the duo, yda's the ditz who can punch stuff well
smart and sassy, big fan favorite
mustton not now
balloons?
that animal thing sis
that's its pom
i don't think we do though
are you calling me slow?!
epic
it's
there's these stages called the coils of bahamut that are split into 3 parts
ngl i'm probably top three in the list of eyan twitch regulars of all time
or are those not out yet?
thats fuckin crazy
to be fair ash rained hell there too
and they did get in here
but man the forums changed a lot
i'm curious to see who she's gonna endorse
it's just nuts that the most diverse list of candidates now boils down to two old white men
people
hot coffee it is
no becasue you're incompetent
so bernie
i am against it but i don't give a fuck about what you do
i do believe biden wants the 15 dollar wage
reduce greenhouse gases
as for international stuff
i fucked up
america
this
that was decisive
argo my sister and i have began adapting that song to be about our dog
basically my me as my oc, and well what do you guys think?
remember the days when you had to wait months for a game to be localized from japanese to english?
cause it was only my gameplay
it's not embarrassing
which is better?
look at then
that is so me
what you think sis?
how dare you call her creepy
i have been officially offered and accepted part time permanently at my workplace!!!
nice work gums!
tbh it’s been less ponies lately since show ended
if that
start of original skype group
also how to properly ignore you without letting on that im ignoring you
i used to be like that
for the rest of you...
bringy
yeah but itd be violent
every time he talks it just brightens your day, y'know?
this is why nerds have the best jokes
but let's playing is kind of dying anyway so yeah
i feel like they will
hence its racist
it’s not that hard
and you get this
doesn't have to be anything too fancy
same sis
yeah i don't blame you there
the secret to success in zeal server is have that one active person
flubs
he doesn’t even need it now
for some weird reason i find his commentary relaxing
you are lazy
also mitch i can vc you soon
take a video and ask him
why lol
he's probably outside sleepin on his bed
it sucks and i hate it
wait he disappeared?
im trying to promote bacon
i know you all don’t watch my streams  but is it bad or good that i keep a stormy profile pic somewhere on the overlay?
i would forget an email and password after 1 hour?
is corona that bad in australia
maybe
i could make a few different jokes about having a third hand sticking out of my butt and they're all in varying degrees of poor taste
theyre just watching us from on high, mocking us mortals for making such a spectacular mess of everything
something something prismo something something monkeys paw
fuck that
alright kiddos
my thing? mens' fashion
i give you a b-
thanks teacher drago
but i did all i can and i only slept a few hours
ie suits
but when hes home he prolly wont be
(original plan was for them to take turns but he ended up playing the whole thing)
also seems like he is now a streamer
10:30
i watched a few of her vids as well
though im getting tired of mcdonalds
also flubs
and my health ain't good for deep fry stuff all the time
flubs your taste is the shit
it sucks and i love it
well flubs
fuck you twitter
i kinda just wanted to meme a bit
no one saw
and if you have no clue why lately i been thinking about youtube and twitch is ever since i got that last supergummying channel banned, i been watching my old vids again
okay
i dont understand but i appreciate it
seriously
i don’t know...
lets just forget all of that sis
(i have the game though)
but wait
don't get my advice on a speech
try not to be nervous
scream animal crossing and promote my social media
unless if there'd be like
brother im workin
take a guess
and it ain’t animal crossing either
i feel like i don't know the switch's library well enough
early morning roast
exactly lol
mario bros. u
i really liked watching chugga first luigi mansion
also im not bringing back “what’s up kiddies”
that doesn't even make any sense
same tbh
this streaming is fun
sis he was like one of my only friends back then
demon lord lets plays arent allowed to die until i say they can die
and then skip a few years i only mostly listen to sis
yeahh “friends”
don't be like spongebob
even though mccann scared away many viewers
what do you mean by that though?
iirc i didn't accept until cuddles told me to go ahead
as you can see, she was the wise of the two of us
back then he hated people making games
i think schools in indianapolis have closed
nah sis
i like him but imma try to avoid his bad gambling addiction in the future
with meat and vegetables in it
because i wanna play with it? i thought you guys know me well at this point
i would have beaten drago
and then my current one is sub-par
and has the power to make good chnages
but i have some ranch left over
ooo bringy
so basically the only social media i have is the gummy twitter
like x and y?
i have never
when you are playing it feels like it's going pretty fast
it was
is slow
gummy now has to come out of the closet
~~yeah because even mitch can beat it~~
she is great
you are no lord
how awesome
that sounds like rabbits are made of quite a few indigestible decomposing biochemicals
whaaat
hoenn
he made a great movie
people make it look easy to get subs
come on, you know i had to look for the pony version
i love the fact they chose rules of rarity
>why was i the only one who failed
bringy told me this and i think sis told me this before
lmao
i made a 3ds pokémon hacking video in 2016 that randomly started being relevant in february
i killed 15
>  i'm still binging drago's sun and moon let's play lol
her smile annoys me
wait that's you?
wrong
guys
drago how the fuck does ash have gengar and a dragonite
and apparently he claim in an interview
because ash is a god ever since winning the league lol
the man is fucking op
and lost hard
this is new
apparently his dragonite hugs him a lot
so hes motivated now
the stakes have been raised
tempting
ep 16
let's say win the league
if i can binge watch at the end of hoenn
you won't make it
tbh it would be neat to watch sun and moon with you and bringy
~~wonder why you aren't watching unova hmmmmm~~
already seen ti
how come wow
no...
someone posted a slavery meme
like this
what is pokemon?
i swear imma punch this girl in my class
says the person who wants to do their own pokemon binge
i wonder would you get banned from discord if you posted straight up porn?
yeah
yeah
which was good
safe tags
\||do this  \||
when you post the image click the spoiler option
there
fuck no
cause knowing bunni and flubs
i have a feeling it's going to end up with <#542191633391681556> as high-quality shitposting and <#677000135552532500> as low-quality shitposting
i fucking let tenda talk about like collars and shit in gummyland the other day
why not just call it safe for shitposts
there
wait
frickin
much better
i think i ran into ida in summer 2014 or so but it might have been 2015
good memories back then
in zeal server?
hes fucking op

not even drago figured me out fast
that would put you somewhere around 11 am on december 30
there's a hsv to rgb equation that i dont remember off the top of my head
i like bossing people around
jk jk
it is safe to post
and he doesn't bother to talk to me!
i think the manechat split changed a lot
now to post rarity pic again
now where was i?
trump is huffing and puffing
winning the hurt game what did u do
nope
i heard they were going to close events to the public but good lord
i believe it was
lets hope they don’t cancel lol esports
make of this what you will
hmmm
if it did that, i have a feeling we'll know prettg quickly
those two arent one and the same, but high propagation can lead to higher mortality rate due to cases overflowing the healthcare infrastructure and having more hosts for a chance to mutate from
i love the chicken video
that was one funny outtake
oh a character
im a little worried
thanks gummy love you
i mean you did call me a fat kid 4 minutes ago but sure
i didn't i was talking about something else 😦
another friend took it and is now at a middle d, after getting 37%
right exactly
ultra sun never fails to trigger me
guys
remember i also work in a gun store as well
how am i crazy?
because they all had something special
it was only until...
after the whole bella mess that my personality shifted to an “i don’t care what you guys do”
only complaint is that there was only 1 flubs in chat and thats not really on you
just because other people are crazier doesn't mean you're not crazy
or anything that is muzzleloading
better not touch na lol esports
the lol world championships this year are hosted in china
well then ill just play it myself, who knows when capcom finally announces aa7
i have never seen a leader do that before
also
dad got back from work
medieval stuff is cool
i learnt leadership from medieval era
give me
yes that is what i meant, maybe my wording was off
mouth masks aren't great because your eyes are also an entry point. full face masks work better but usually run on filters that cost $80 and last 24 hours
might just be a different country thing then
air is for losers
biochemistry needs gloves much more than goggles anyway. people in analytics course might be usin them for some specific classes tho, if i had to hazard a guess
bringy, i was a smart teenager
you are not kirby
a kid at my high school was doing a demo in physics where you put water on a glass plate and whip it around in a circle
she talks like a robot
and ace attorney
sleep early
gummy is fiction
it's my current twitter banner
you are bad at knowing the leaders
i'm waiting for news to come out saying trump has corona because it wouldn't be a shock at this point when he came in contact with the brazil president
yes he prob would
that's the messed up part there are people that still support him it makes me sick
this entire pandemic will be trump's downfall in november because it's a common thing in history where the current president in a crisis usually gets voted out in the coming election
dunning-krueger effect, i think
will there be a carbon tax?
you sure about that?
i'd rather be under canadian consveratives
i just worry because of this morning when saskatoon said they had their first case
yeah it helps but i got a job man
and anything good for me is good for anyone else
seems like my next con may not happen then...
i'm probably gonna skip going home for easter or for my siblings' birthday
yeah that's why i shared this here specifically
because its a virus, isnt it gonna mutate and shit?
thursday, march 19, 2020 - wednesday, march 25, 2020
yeah i should be safe
what makes it boring
then we move on the switch briefly
new estimated delivery date:
just have a decent following and active, you can email them
blitz
arriving 19 mar - 25 mar
i don't think my banner who bringina will draw will be done
because he isn't afraid
riots all over the place
watch this clip if you can of new new spongebob
it's nice to see them with a more fleshed out personality
there's way better reasons than that to kill amazon
it's owned by a dirtbag, for one
"i'm sorry to know that your pre order item that is to be delivered today has not shipped yet. please do not worry, i'll check the details and try my best to help you."
i hate that guy
i am gonna burn all of amazon down
i like these people for getting me free shit
i take back everything i just said
gen 7 just hates me for whatever reason
my pleasure
i think it's funny and bad
like i said
yeah
insert italian joke here
so i prob won't take a day off
i need to clean everywhere
that's what i've told him
xi is a robot, change my mind
like with detergent or something
it's easy to clean just by being in the shower
not that you were a nazi and bad at hiding it, that you were actually hitler
and said $480.55 has been charged on it
so i gave her more than what she expected
they need it for bathroom breaks
i've been
maybe it’s the virus?
i also believe in equity
thanks both
you have a time limit and they say the basic things that i already know
being around family will always lighten the mood
your brothers prob miss you, and well from what you told me, i don’t think the virus will be an issue
i think im one of the few people though that can’t be around family that long cause fights breakout
with the coronavirus
wait
i need like at least 2 days of rest before making the return trip
at this point im literally used to it
i think so
and the fact that he admitted there may have been fine people on the "not literal nazi" side is pretty good, on his standards
i want this man as president
could you
jean-christophe
trump said once neo nazis and people defending against them had good people on both sides
im pretty sure i acted nothing like a nazi back then, and im pretty sure i still don’t act like one to this day
it uh, did not go well
<#580946892201000960>
well you've got six days
i hear eyan wants to play animal crossing
but it’s cute
yeah something like that
yes....they replaced the mlp show
i don't really care
oh yoiu mean a different welcome message for each guild
so instead of this
recursion is limited to 2000 characters
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
was it?
what can bot actually do?
actually now that i think about it
wait is bot not a global const?
interesting
i'll do that after i get the existing ones up and running in the new format
yeah i guess
i keep thinking im sis with my profile pic
oh her!!
out of all the games you showed me, it’s my fave
im currently team flare aliana
why does that guy look like a lion
why cant pokemon characters look normal
objectively wrong
and thatd be sick
if biden is elected we would prob have an obama coalition again
id take any obama as vp really
i think it's likely his running mate will end up taking over the ticket in 2024 assuming he wins
ive read reports hillary could be a vp
...could he make trump his running mate?
im not saying he should or would im just wondering if its allowed
nah i think that was before he was speaker
he's gonna be too old to run for a second term
first rule as vp, no white house!
the more gothic and mysterious
this actually can represent me well
but then we found something we didn’t agree on
so the extreme right guy and me agreed on some things...
dear god
all prisoners should be executed for population control
don’t care if they are innocent or the crime
we must kill some innocent for population control
he’s not trolling
if you had the views of kim running for pm in canada i would cut ties with you and leave
however
i hope so
ironic that it's called the people's party when most of the people apparently have far right views
he’s trying to get me to move to the right
he says sanders is communist
though he doesn’t think biden is mafia
> my dad also believes kim jong un should run canada
whats going on tonight?
they are central
ndp and green are left
like where they say men shouldn’t exist
i don’t fully support them, thats a difference
then again, sis doesn’t want a cool castle
when i get back on final fate
thats not fair or true mitch
yall talk too dang much
he takes the blame for the good stuff
gummy i could literally push you over and you wouldnt be able to do anything about it
you said creative costume, huh
no screw off, bot
i believe he told me it was alabama
one of you guys told me i had cancer cause a cat sniff me
hello blitzypoo
i had a dream that i drove my mom's van through the wall of the house once
daily streaming hasn’t been going well since i took a tiny break on thursday
wtf why does everyone wanna separate from canada
mitch imma tell you something surprising
canada or at least here has a lot of young conservatives
it wasn’t that mitch
that was the issue
he tax people on gas to help stop climate change but did the opposite with that
that's a good man right there
i go back to my argument saying people can hate politicians all they want but it's a needed qualification
is to really shut down anyone dumping waste in the ocean
same
i saw plastic bags flying everywhere
difference is
a musket can shoot down like one person a minute, if you get lucky with your aim and don't get interrupted reloading
instead of jail
this would stress me out a lot
what you guys think?
also yes...i would probably wanna build a gothic castle for myself. i like to make it represent me
i also kept other things we have talked about
what about boris johnson
where everything is now circle
thats my new channel
~~who said it was your channel~~
i think the thing with pollution
im not crazy im deranged
mine is better!!
also you'd have to actually play the game
then i can play
is that the one i used viner hand itc all over the place
flubs do i sound more or less nasally in your head
ive heard the voice but its gone man
nightshade sounds german?
idk she sounds kinda american to me almost
according to you i sound depressed so i dont trust you gummy
sometimes we stay away from the things we like because they suck. uberfacts is worse than meth
and even if its true what does that even mean
he misses flubs
not today though because i killed my voice already
guys
and mitch, trudeau won’t annex usa
cnn?!
dunno
then you have parents threaten to bring students to teachers if schools closed down
it was all just stuff you had learned already, completely pointless
lpt: never call something a "literacy test" its got a nasty past
everyone
no we did, that was just an extra requirement you had to do
lets go back to this youtube business
because everyone's related
alright new supergummying channel
never thought i would ever see canada close borders
thatd be good. no more canada
flubs
that makes sense actually
don't compare me to that movie
as long as my head doesnt get used as a arm rest by taller person again im good
and air pollution
but tune in tomorrow maybe?? for pokemon finale
the rat
oh sis, i got this toy
i think i know why i like playing with toys, it’s my happy spot in brain
my little sis and me are at our worse today in terms of insult
no sis..but i tend to chew on a lot of things
he's old, i bet she could make it look like an accident
the last time i told bringy this joke, she used a squirt bottle of me
americans are the least prepared
you will with an alligator
because i am preparing to call amazon
you don't get it here in america if you are poor and can't pay taxes you are punished but if you are swimming in cash they don't care if you don't pay
we all know trump doesn't unless it seems so because he doesn't want to release his tax returns
it was a business trip not a vacation
good news
i should cancel switch
rat attack
would think gamestop would restock them when the game comes out
like they told me...
i already threw two temper tantrums at amazon
lol i'm ever gonna beat gen 7
its too late for that to work now
itai no wa iya nano de bougyoryoku ni kyokufuri shitai to omoimasu 
i should have bought switch at chick fil a
well that wasn't very nice of her
congrats
so thats why the cs people want cs courses in k-12
and buy a normal one
something about the eues
she would love it
i've attempted it twice and haven't gotten one attack off
i'm amazed gummy was able to beat him because he is literally impossible
stormy would hate me if she saw i suggested that
.....
i am very happy my first true series on stream is done
hey at least i didn't ignore pokemon refresh
a squirt bottle
danganronpa 2 has a russian roulette scene
sis, permission to burn jeff guy who owns amazon?
don't read the comments, spoilers
ditto
dont listen to her gummy you dont need a good reason to set someone on fire
and anywhere you are is a good place to go if you want to practice social distancing
i never thought i would say this but i think biden has a legit shot at beating trump given the virus situation or if anything it would be a very close race
agreed
what is wrong with you like give me a break
just looked biden won
will be either platinum or danganronpa
im playing destiny 😦
join and listen while playing?
you should be a pokemon boobie streamer xd
i dont appreciate it
our units are cooler because one of them is named after a part of the body
probably actually
10% of the followers are friends, the rest are random
your regularly scheduled cynicism will resume shortly
well no!
i don't have a switch at all
i think i managed to get up to 40 followers on twitch and like . . . 35 of them were friends
i meant your wii u and whatever
join!!!
so, yeah
maybe you have one that can take the funny tv cables that the wii uses
it's part of a fan-made mod
oikay
you have to press start, select, l and r right before the poké ball shakes for the third time
no it doesnt shut up
dammit stormy
what no i meant for the ability to throw poké balls
or was it hg
pokepark is kinda meh, i think the first game was better than second
what the frig is pokepark
think it's a troll article
guys
that just seems like a bad business decision
too bad you weren’t close by, i wouldn’t mind letting you borrow mine
i do want to be an author
oh congrats!
btw guys
it's very bad in italy apparently hospitals are failing and 300 are dying a day
lubs
maybe i should order one
thought you wouldn't move for another few years
the number has been rising hour by hour
we now have 9k corona cases in america
oh my
get demon lord to do one
you should watch that funny vid
here
this is blessed
my pleasure
okay so switch is coming either tomorrow or monday
also i take it with the no replies from earlier
gummy is everywhere
i mean yes
because i never say anything about him thats chill
how about in an hour?
by 2025 they'll probably change their company name to funko-pop stop
yes but actually no
or alternatively, bestbest buy
gums wants to stream but he can't
gummy you being mad at something isnt anything new
btestesb buy
and calculus tells imaginary numbers to take a hike most of the time and sticks to being operable in r^n
not the same one as the kitty
why does sis get all those fancy looking clothes
mine looks basic
not that far
are you following me?
i thought i did?
upper section
i was reading an email okay
i'm making some stuff for you
did you get an error message saying you were currently wearing the best equipment?
it says gears for an arcanist equipped
it's like someone cut karna in half and stuck rarity's head on
i've finished the body and legs
no it's the fact that you're on a trial character
wait am
i have no idea
it's because you need two to learn it
this guy
well if you don't already have the same one, yes
so i went somewhere
where?
oh my
oh okay
which is basically me
anyways
gummy do you need a hug
no thanks
but even if i have switch
i wanted to stream animal crossing
it is
i need to talk to someone about something stupid everyday
but see we killed all the big ones already and we kept the little ones as pets to minimze the threat while keeping the weak as a token of conquest
i accidentally punched my cat in the face
watch your back
i can make it all ritual-like
i decides to stop at walmart to look at toys
i should have realized sooner since it clearly said made in china on the back
~~but you are so i'll just have you do everything for me instead~~
hey transformers are my life
yay i teleported
also the second nightshade appears the lurkers come out
wait i'm sorry
it was an accident she jumped onto my desk as i was reaching for my controller t.t
or was plotting my death
cause sis owns it flubs
id be a fair and honest dictator who ruled purely through terror
oh you corrected it
awww
unless sis says no
also what did i miss?
and don’t tell me to re read msgs
oh boy
so true?
i mean i have it, im not very clear
like i said animal crossing doesn't have a lot of things to do at this point
...what?
completely forget which
since i done most of the thigns
im more impressed that there is a hashtag thanking him lol
that was beto o rourke's downfall
greater than or less then in complex numbers aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
better yet can the uk just take us back to their country
im at high risk tomorrow
6am = best time
yeah but minus four hours
i have exactly 1 other morning bird in my life 💔
we do have midges, though
im scared
tiny flies that go around in clouds
i been hearing the same thing happen in california
gummy are you on quarantine or something after today?
who?
but can you over a ukrainian accent?
no drago, the issue is my parents want me back at my hometown and not the city
but not today
"hello everyone, i'm here to substitute stream for gummy. now, the situation calls for me to use thunderbolt on this gyarados, but i need to stay in-character so we'll have gummy using surf on it instead"
she knows you got a switch and is hiding
bringy would never hide from me
no but you act like one
spoiler: yes
but...she’s been afk all day
she has this pokemon as her signature one
hmmm
too bad the other girl is anti greta
shes the one in the windmill place?
platinum is good but its too darn slow
gen 2...clair??
even though she talked like a robot
i think thats how you spell her name
gummy why are they all wearing off-brand google glass
gen 4 would be mars and jupiter
it’s not confirmed but hinted a bit that the blue and purple hair girls were crushed to death
team rocket trap those two in a net in their building
platinum or x and y
also ida cynthia's a history nerd and she has hair partially covering one eye, come on
pretty sure i scratched the screen
i don’t give a fuck if i have 0 viewers
now don’t tell me that it doesn’t have alcohol in it
dying and being declared dead are different
surprisingly similar to youtube but i don't find it awful for once
im making alcohol
i still have the logs
alright i feel bad for that
but one wants sour cream, which i don't wanna use
isnt buttermilk on its own really sour?
why would you compare the two
i can make enough for everybody xd
prof looked at my midterm and said looks like i aced it, or at least "very close to"
yall are fucking barbarians
that's okay because the queen's got at least another 50 years ahead of her
is he the one that was at the epstein island all the time
that was prince andrew
i want this comic so badly
thats such a strange tweet
i want sis as president
[vomits all over the presidents of the united states posters in middle schools all across the country]
that is fucked up
am i the only one who thinks bernie should just suspend due to the primary being over pretty much
theyre pretty much saying that people arent allowed to take sick days
not that i think mcdonalds actually has good food, but jesus christ
anyways
yummy
here is the source
not anymore
but i have issues consuming most sweets
that's illegal
why didn't you bring your stream setup with you?
now this is stressful
then realized bringina and me would have so much meme material
so i guess you're not able to just make another profile on your switch and have a separate town on that one right?
this is what i will do to my hr person
but yeah that all made sense
i personally asked saturday off
i didn't know you could do that
yikes you live in new york hope you are staying safe
gummy will time travel after all
well maybe...
also napoleon was in charge of elba before he left so this works sooo well
gummy you should make your character look like this:
i got the special animal crossing switch
gummy has just realized the joycons have batteries
i thought those were scratches
how am i going to survive until may 29
i don't remember ever seeing residue on mine
bravely default two
god i wish i could use a switch
yes there was an ordeal involving gamestop with xenoblade
gummy internet will get better once he’s back to his territory
i can’t believe i complained to amazon last night when it turns out my switch ain’t damaged
im a couple days behind people in animal crossing
apparently you are the only person that didn't know they need charged
so i assume the screen needed charging
and upgrade
curse you mall
one moment
who the fuck is dan
and it's not stacy's mom, it's even worse than that
sorry nightshade but i gotta destroy your house\
though as much as i like this switch thing
xbox
oh thank god i can say no
yeah lol
mai factor?
well
and he has said stupid things before
people keep electing stupid people
both are rapist
if only you didn't have to be born in america to run for president
i remind her a month after
got 100% on my linear algebra midterm 2! yus
permission to punch her?
i felt so confident on that bitch
wii u
i remember first time going through the exam, before i went and rewent through all the problems to check my work
yeah that's usually where i mess up too
if it does i might have to wait to go in the mid summer
you want a fuckin roof? get building
i need the integral of e^(-.5xx) since infections are an accumulated value
long story short, if every particle in the observable universe was a bit, you still wouldn't be able to contain it
my dad called
nah my dad says the un guy should have warn people sooner
yes voting for biden is better than trump
but i still would feel uncomfortable voting for the other rapist
i said voting for biden is better than trump
racist
violating the constitution
biden will at least put the brakes on free-fall instead of firing the rocket thrusters at the sky
reps would have nothing on him the hunter biden thing happened when he wasn't president
the problem is, because biden’s accuser talked about what biden did to her
did bernie commit to the female vp?
instead he brought out all of the rednecks who would otherwise have just sat in their sheds with the ar-15s and complained that john kasich or whoever was just another one of the educated elite who didn't care about them
kasich :(
if anything kasich was more tolerable now inb4 i watch a messed up clip of him and my opinion changes
sums up the 2016 gop race
no wonder trump won this thing
i always find it kind of fun to look at all the candidate logos for the ones who had no chance
that's the part she never seemed to explain
yeah
yes he was a libertarian
~~nah sis is just avoiding you~~

well sorta
its your job to save the world, some people just get hit in the process
ive only played like 3 final fantasies and they look nothing like ones they make now
and some of the non-heretics are also very sane
the intro was the most exciting part
good point
im trying to convince my family im a vampire
what else am i supposed to do?
like fear of cameras sort of thing?
it's only the aunts + mom for some reason. literally nobody else gives me a hard time about it.
i must not play any more video games until i get things done. i must not play any more video games until i get things done. i must not play any more video games until i get things done. i must not play any more v
i am too tbh
im easily triggered by a slight thing
basically i struggle to tell people apart
this is a good thing
demonlord i'm allergic to cannabis, so that is out for me
like, hair is my best way of telling who's who
i know i have a habit of saying "you look like the person i saw at the store today"
i can sort of read faces
wait its possible to be allergic to weed?
i've heard it's good for relaxing nerves, but that's really all i know
which is really saying something
in my experience, no drug has made me feel worse than weed
i didn't read it right
there we go, helping each other
now time to marry the ones that don't
has eyan streamed it recently?
calm down sis
but i have an idea
yeah for sure, losing someone ain't easy at all
but once again i don't have a team
cool
no overlay, no fancy shit
gummy i spelled rhyme right first try
is because it was my first walkthrough game before my supergummying days
gummy if you want i can make covers for ya
idc if you are low battery
gummy everyone knows youre the best server owner
so credit goes to sis
yeaj
the only reason im a decent owner is because i have no life
look the bot gets lonely, _someone's_ got to play with him
feed rabbit gummies
oh god
where's the fun in doing things the easy way
what did you do
had to move revalatia sadly
think i put switch on the floor?
you're basically intercepting the signal from the console, making a copy of it using the capture card, and then routing it to both your computer and the tv
his grandmother died this weekend
it's actually even easier from a gateway
people in the comments are saying he was fired for violating quarantine, but amazon suddenly caring aobut that feels a bit like the boy crying wolf
happy mod day bringy
blitzypoo
he needed more ram in order to play it
website
in a serious way yes, in a funny way yes
then bought the full version on the website
i can give it to you if you need it
gums went to walmart

lifes a joke and im the star
the launch of bacon will be funny
i think you should have given up a long time ago
and i can't play my wii games with wii u cause i sold it
galaxy 2 summed up: mario spaceship
galaxy 3 is best
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
at the end of the day it all comes down to personal preference, both games are objectively the same, which is to say amazing no matter which one
flubs v superman
which first level
the pruning message really should go in a logging channel but every time it appears yall say something funny so i leave it in
i can't help it xd
it doesn't help that demon lord is canadian kek
kugal are you a canadian in disguise?
maybe it's not that i'm super nice
i need to be mean to balance things out
but i like my vans
are they white
nobody respects the double joke :(
and a year older
they were $98
yup that is charlie, on the couch ottoman haha

but sis would kill me\
im prob the most aggressive one here
clearly you have trapped yourself
> aren't i nice?
no
oh nice
congrats, you're famous
thanks, i think ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
youcould make the prank being acting clever for a day
that's for halloween
and i am clever?
april
im just meh and go along with it
while im sitting here watching, wow i did say i wanted the world fo burn once
i guess that works
so we went to her
and 3 of us were there dancing the manderville at her
it's always weird about things like this
now my internet cut
me either
oh i can hear some volume
something
its funny
white mage
no clue, ask sis, she prob knows
they were more like tutorials
thought it was mordred
so if i get this game, will i be okay? or do i need to get the past games to understand story?
though its story might be written with the assumption that people will expect it to be like the other games
i never do anything about today
final fantasy issues with laptop
seems like a waste
though it's flubs bday
i moved around and realized it wasn’t like mario 3d land
(she thought it was endlessly funny)
there made up my mind
lets call it dan day then
im interested
damn it
guys quick we need more innuendos
i want to play black mage
okay then black wage, white mage, and i will think about two other classes
you must first
wreck the black mage
man this sounds better than fire emblem
it's agnes
the other two protagonists are a farm boy named tiz and a guy called ringabel cause he can't remember his name
she looks like one of those maids in pokemon
not quite as interesting as the mysterious d's journal
because of course it is
he was still here a bit after posting that
they finally found out
but it was the last thing he said here
best wii sports resort game
the one with the uh
i forget what it's called
can be anyone, even a fictional character
but no im conducting this survey because im curious
im a little stumped by this one
im sure id think of more if i gave it a sec
theres no universes in computers
john is just a very social dude but hes also a really good business man, my aunt marie is really fucking smart
gummy do you want a list of people from me also or is this one sufficient?
i love how mafia that sounds
i mean, how i get killed by real mafia people who think im in the mafia
can i steal obama
then there was this one english teacher i had in high school who was pretty cool (yes, english class, i know)
same
did i do something wrong
sis you are dark
for fictional characters
no i'm just a discworld fan
at one point he tried to do the schrodinger's cat experiment but decided it was too cruel and took the cat from the box
was he in the wee free men? i remember seeing someone talking in small caps for some reason but i cant remember if he was in the wee free men
willie was the loser
what happened this morning?
i think another person would be biff loman from the play "death of a salesman"
did i tell you i attempted to get bringy a laptop for her bday?
oh and i happen to tell her that today out of all days
serena's mom is cute too
she yelled at me
for trying to buy her expensive stuff
i saw this on facebook so imma do it
nice middle name
8/14
nooo drago
i don't think so
drago stop violating the circlejerk, all new stuff is bad
i deliberately left family members off the list because that feels like kind of the easy answer
but like kida
gums would never do that
i still want a brand new jacket
whyyy
never
i guess there's always paarthurnax
i thought you love benny the most
gummy doesn't get basic slang
stalker
come on be honest, it even looks like one
florida looks like a knob
my parents are also going crazy because there's more provisions for how businesses are supposed to handle this
be nice
that was like 10 seconds
kugal no stop being nice :(
that would be between two raised to the kugal and kugal raised to the kugal
ive got this one pain in my back i cant get rid of
but also kugal glad that his loved ones are still safe
drago
it's fun
yes and i'm wearing it right now
am in the women's section?
kugal to be fair she does use a musharna in unova
oooh thanks for having my back drago ;p
me too
~~i don't need to wish~~
ida wanna trade hair
from my apartment
but i was in the store
i thought ted cruz was tom cruise
gummy did do everything to help her
but now recently they just said that employee may have virus
so im likely okay
tomorrow i need to head back to the city to retrieve my work papers
sis is a bit sick
also gummy are you even likely to die from it?
asthma
but my dad says sanders is a godfather
schizophrenia
i'm worried about my grandma tbh
tense
im worried more about people’s um mental condition of this virus? maybe that’s the word
hopefully everyone will be okay
i ran out of materials though
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
depends on the stupid thing
kugal i'm going to start a stopwatch and i need you to target one hug every thirty seconds
what did you do
you made me like rare steaks, sis made me nicer, drago got me quit youtube
he refuses
some do, yes ye
haven't talked to that one
....
i was gonna play final fantasy today but well sis wasn’t online so i didn’t get on
instead i proceeded to punch my laptop a few times today
i was doing an essay due next week
it froze on me
bit of a testament to how virulent this thing is that you need to be wary of places that you were a week ago :p
and her mom also told me they would have done the same
and it didn’t auto save anything
also i realized im bubble gum here lol
omg....
well since im stuck and bored besides essay
i think one of you guys called me that back then so i changed it to bubble gum here
gummy wheres todays weird question
fuck
for me it was watching chugga and eyan on youtube that made me wanted to create a username and do youtube which eventually led to all of this
i use that if flubs is taken which it often is because its 5 letters
my irl friends and i don't have anything in common that much
we are going to la
i'd get him being 99 but i don't think he'd violate quarantine
though still think it's easier to talk online than irl
dunno if there's many different types of malt
or tortillas
is that alcohol
i probably could have deduced that
like it depends what it is
but for like for milkshake flavours, i’ll try anything
i gotta prepare my taste buds though
no kugal not so fast, you need to pace yourself! you don't want to burn out on hugs too fast!
so i gotta basically go back to eu mode and try everything or im stuck at mcdonald’s forever
i think that qualifies as "my own dang fault"
you can feel my whole ribcage
i guess thats kinda good
though you wouldnt be able to walk properly without your big toe
what bone?
some of my college blurred together so maybe its true
though you're right drago, its a little disorienting if you stop and think about it
besides, after you start working places and there are everyone between about the ages 19 and 65 around you, it stops being important
i pay you a full wage
mitch don't be mean, you'll put me out of work
nightshade why on earth are you up at this hour
it's gummy
no flubs this started before the societal collapse
my family loves both
why are you using my middle name all of the sudden
demon lord is dan
kugal's legal name is charlie the good boy
so kugal sad
i have him on facebook
"michael why did you add a bunch of random people from halfway across the globe?" "i dunno mom, some of the people in my high school decided to move really really far away"
mitch's name is mitch
pretty explosions
five below what
i know kugals name is charlie
he wont wake up because he has standards above dumpster diving
yeah but when he wakes up ill be asleep so its gonna throw an error
what kind of coin then?
its not that kind of coin
i want in and out burger though
she sounds like she's being interrogated
remember when i told you my laptop crashed yesterday?
i just did
well...
<:skarmthink:692790214531350608>
which is one of the reasons i'm taking so long to get through botw
first video game
thats a long time
jello!
its a dog with a sword in its mouth. its on the boxart
and its got like *twelve* colors
that sounds like the opposite of having coins
what gothic movie shall i watch tonight flubs?
ive got the bw and the hgss
you are fine
tsar putin tsar putin
i finally live in an age to maybe see a tsar again
sooo
my senile 95 year old chainsmoking grandmother looks younger than trump
err putin or trump?
trump probably has wet dreams of being like putin
trump is a wannabe emperor
id say trump is better
but he pulls some strings
5:07
pick
kim jong un or trump
the only thing trump doesn't do kim jong things is because it would be hard to get away with
trump
i wanna see gummy roast the leader of the opposition in pmqs
that laura ingraham has to be paid to say what she says because i've never seen a female with that much conservative beliefs
so everyone can see it
im returning to youtube
with this video i will replicate
if trump was so fed up in the 80s he should have just ran maybe he would have won lol
because he is an idiot which btw he was involved with a model named stormy daniels
i once made a dnd character who was a rogue called scarlet cross
sorry, spent all the present money on ryan gosling
yeah the tools breaking are the stupidest
is mitch one?
thing in new horizons so far
<a:a_wind_faceofmercy:590514191736242186>
well
i stole peach from u in ac already. uve already ceased to be useful for me
it's not that horrifying
use a wii zapper
> eh my sister is a little messed up
"a little"
...ah
i think she is only like that with me
what you guys think?
amazing gummy
i assume new york for you
yeah but putin called him up so hes gotta
fuckin yeah
this means i should probably look through my other old accounts that have shit passwords for any other cracks
and go on ubereats
do you want one sis?
im not good at trivia so i prob will never play
in fact very little is trivia
we only had that one night of hangouts awhile ago
nope
do i have to teach you how to make friends again?
this guy gets it
flubs
“jackbox games probably. idk if i have anything else people would be interested in”
jackbox is on steam tho
apparently on ps4 as well
the sound the pull stars make
ehhh
you can smell him from afar
i dont know any of the words beyond that
now then
wtf is this
this is what my little sister texted me yesterday
my friend that who i've told about you guys wants to know your opinion on cyberpower's computers cos he keeps reading mixed stuff, thanks pals
your irl sis scares the hecc outta me
i think so
just remember, nothing is as overpriced as the computers dell advertises to businesspeople in my newspaper
<:skarmthink:692790214531350608>
more of an everyday pc or gaming?
then maybe we have issue
pls do\
500 gb ssd is one windows 10 plus nine times fallout 4
alternatively just wait for newegg to have a sale on hard drives and then slap in a few
you know, i"ve never actually looked up the msrp of the individual components in my computer
i don't think
i think her friends do
but at the playground they somehow turned on me, prob what my sister said to those two, and i think my sister’s friend’s brother threaten me, then i believe he told or said something to my classmate that was also at the playground
tensions were high on the way home but i think at that point they all shut up because of what i did
a lot
before her friends meet me, she tells them all the nasty things about me which aren’t true
so when i meet them they want to fight me
i think this recently has stopped??
ever since we moved to city
fun fact that classmate i fought
sounds fun
now that is story time with gummy
im always bad with trips
hes either going to visit bringina or hes gonna surprise visit one of us on our doorstep
true
but sis would likely slam door on me, drago would say no one is home, and flubs would get benny to eat me
napoleon's mother was a hamster and his father smelled of elderberries
shut up
no one knows about this
but with more flubs
nooo
now i deny all allegations that it was me that destroy skype group
because they pretty much werent
gummyland is stupid
i don't do anything
different worlds i get it
could be worse
doesnt mean i like any less (yall are my favorite), its just very different dynamics
eh i mean i did introduce you guys to mitch
nahvec
fuck i don't remember
yeah that was my biggest mistake trying to put everyone together
nope don't remember
as long as no one dies
but flubs was an issue
lack of attention, gummys ultimate enemy
she is good at pokemon
i kicked her butt with a shuckle
mega
zach likes everyone
he doesnt count
is gums cute?
i'm gonna sleep
never met him
chugga i assume would be the hardest?
ah the days before the minecraft let's players took over youtube
i have one to chip in
but i'm busy disagreeing with this physics lecture on the basis of angular physics sucking
that person
developed in 2959
corphish and i were rivals and people joke that we would never get popular
and then corphish gets 50k subs
did he actually?
i think corphish criticized your vids once drago lol
i wasn't too too sure
this was before he was popular
i mean, they got it to the moon
pony vids work
a five-second reaction video of anges shouting "unacceptable" has more traffic than _almost the entirety of my 130-video bravely default let's play_
foiled again
bios
bringy and me have platinum planned next
but stream is on haitus
cause im stuck at parents home
i would even put new horizons ahead for me
we'll see if new horizons becomes my new favorite once i get around to picking it up
i could definitely see myself getting way into new horizons, but new leaf just didn't do it for me
it's not as bad as most places, but you can still save a bit more if you build your own
canada sure is obsessed with wanting to have us states
what the actual hecc
oh right the conservative party lol
i can't imagine how bad economics wise it would be for every western province to leave the country wouldn't exist
there are 600 states
it's 50 lol
because they burned down the white house
he will crush them all
blue vs red
can't believe the british choked in the american revolution
because france, spain, and netherlands helped
wonder how it would play out in alternate history if the colonists lost
trump hates mitt romney though and he's republican
nvm got it
hes got a desk
boris has a history of sexism
i still get along with the old forum people and i apparently still get along with you lot, but we've already seen how that does not go badly when those two groups intersect
anti lgbt
king harald v of norway
we got bored
go get married, i dont give a shit who you are
but his fave pony is rarity
no your drivers license gets two points and then is killed
granted that's mainly the governors and trump's fault for not doing a nationwide lockdown
i want somebody who can win the nominee and beat trump i think biden is that person as of right now
i don't because americans are dumbasses, but bernie's all but not an option now
i bet he would be better than biden and trump
"we've forgotten the crackers"
bios
because one i hate horror
and also the one where the knight saves the dragon from the evil princess
indeed
write your darn essay
future gummy will thank present gummy
who wants to join?
gummy has homework during a pandemic what is this
so after a few weeks of not being able to figure out where it came from, i just threw a classic `if (you should not be able to talk to this) { dont() }` at the top of the code file and boom, problem solved
efficient
good for their search engine optimization, probably
why did they opt for begin end instead of {}? that's like 6 more characters per block and makes chaining them look even worse
they didn't
i just did it that way because it looks stupid
tom scott you mad, mad lad
with touch screen
i'm generally at my laptop
okay
i swear if he dies it would suck
true but you gotta think boris is currently in office and i don't think a pm at least in the uk has died in office
ok gummy;s sister, take notes from drago's sister, this is how you do it
hi dad
you can't
a parrot
no i meant is she the crazy aunt or something?
haven't heard that saying in a long time
....am i that predictable?
m!tree
maybe it violated the second law of thermodynamics and made ida smarter but gummy dumber
i dont feel like opening my main
well
sure it has
oh wow he has a lot more sabers than grievious does
i wonder if the discord api can speifically ask stuff to skip the log
i dont think that appears on audit log
get them into good habits
except you probably should use some discipline on the regulars and mods
same
it's hard though because the last time i did that
hence why i am just like "pls don't do that again?
thats no good
6 actions per second yes
is he actually being rate limited?
so the one on top is the one that affects color?
probably
no idea
now this one is sooo me
cryptography math is beautiful
i've been manually making reimann sums when that function's been around this whole time
i don't think i've run into a functoin to do that
argo and i are locked in eternal combat for who can be the biggest loser
biggest loser
i thought the main concern was the audit log being messed up
thank
because i am a goose
that just looks inefficient though
classy
stuff like summons and mayhem role is all hard-coded and you can't actually access it without being one of us
that doesn't include the additional margin of additional features we want to add
for comparison
eyansays probably next time
holy shit you guys were still at it
do you actually want that back lmao
i could do it, it would take like two seconds
going outside ain't a good idea currently
i can still go out into the backyard lmao
e!gummy
did you add e !xkcd ####
what was e!gummy for
argo is twitch stuff going to come back or nah
i'll give it the "leave it out unless someone asks" status
i have more important things to not remember
people
    if (!line.endswith("?")){
although this.toilet=3 was a pretty funny line to have in every user object
    }
    */``` lol
don't you have fingers
```function /*boolean*/ lineishmm(line){
    line=line.tolowercase();
neither did i
    var hmm=/[h][m]+/g;
    var match=line.match(hmm);
}``` lol *2
and yes that is regex
`function utilitybotstats(e)` oh right this is another easy utility one
its easier to do  (97 /\*'a'\*/) at that point
wrath the leafeetoday at 9:53 pm
doing fine
just drawing a swastika
gonna be a fun night in gumland
have netflix?
they are as bad as far right
and that because they are a man they are awful when this person is gender fluid
i'm at least 35% convinced that a bulk of the radical feminists are just the alt-right trying to make the left look bad, because there's no way people can actually be that stupid and survive until adulthood
ok carry on i won't defend anything there
i mean when you're a gop member who believes the ancient babylonians are too far to the left, than yeah, pretty much everyone's a radical
faaaaaaaaaaaaar off in it
take any conservative female who has ever ran for office and switch them to the left you would get the same thing
im slandering mitch
yes i was asleep most of that time
damn man you got me
yeah
stay up for an hour or two and then go back to bed
i get snarky when i feel this way
you also get points on your license
tbh he kind of sounds like joe biden in terms of his voice
my governor
that's why they have the same sounding voice lol
i cant be bothered to touch my mouse
you know the one
pretty much
stay up all night
holy shit
stay up
    most questions in the zelian dialect of english don't end in question marks
so, archers, lancers, and conjurers
who look very alike
thats way more characters to afford a little clarity
maybe my brain made the one i got an old fart because it was funnier
super life pro tip: if you have a name that's related to bathroom humor, don't run for president
but we did have a second president johnson who _wasn't_ impeached, giving a 20% success rate on bathroom humor presidents
whos the closest online friend to you..
i was like errr mitch, star, sis, and bringina
in fact what would be the issue with him just saying stormy was a girl
it's not like you say she's a girl and then he asks if they are trans right
point is i only briefly said who is who,
the fact you get my state confused makes no sense
theres only one real state
would not mind living in illinois since it's blue but whatevs
also he thought iceland was next to norway
geography
i mentioned my quebec friend
also i almost showed you guys what i got for bringy’s bday
so abort
i’ll pm you why
also i talked about tenda and drago to my dad
in fact we need more parties
that's why we need more political parties which we kind of do but aren't major parties and we need government revamped so we can replace the house and senate with parliament
which has yet to happen in the part of my life where i've been old enough to vote
they started to insult the other party and stuff
the major parties from what i've seen of third parties would be
excuse you, i'm a proud member of the idiot brain-dead liberal party (so says reddit)
democratic would fit mitch the most surprisingly
and green would surprisingly fit sis the most
idk they rpobably believe in having rules or somethign weird like that
doesn't help that in the republican primaries the winner of a particular state takes all the delegates from it
dang then we would have had a president dick except it would have been the first name lol
birb party
present company included
i support the goddamn second amendment
i hate this theme now
reason why is that anyone making speedruns in mario maker 2 uses that theme
article is spot on
little sister says she will touch me with gloves later on after handing money
aside from the nuzlocke though i don't know how any of the others work
so i guess not all lets plays are dying
i think i banned a bunch of funny ones as a joke
at one poitn i banned "toilet" for me because everyone got sick of me saying it
we gotta do that again for a day for the memories
it's like one of the cosmological constants
there it is
the dnc is prob thinking if some backup plan because biden isn't in good health
i haven't played mount and blade warband napoleonic wars
im a happy boi \o/ and i hope everyone else is too
my city population is like 300k so i dunno if thats too big or whatnot, it's a bit smaller of where my friends live
oh dang haha
im kind of thankful for my health right now too
i dont go out on walks anymore
yes definitely, this is gonna take a long time to recover from
lmfao i love that
can i come?
what a stupid party
im not pro gun or anti gun
but everyone here is very mature
when everyone agrees with everyone on everything, you get situations like this fun one that i had to deal with this morning
and facts are thrown out the window
things seem better today though
also my return to youtube joke never happened....yet
there are 358 days until april first 2021
we really do live in a world where more and more people believe what they want to believe
i sadly can't stream or have any of my equipment to work on things outside streams
one of them, probably
and then it got put off until 2019
and holy shit i do not know how he managed to do 3 walkthroughs at the same time
back then that trend wasn't a big thing
i watched sneaky play it yesterday
gummy you should watch my new wooloo appreciation let's play series
drago pin fewer folders jesus
im taking flubs to taco bell
im not even offended im just confused
and im mad
what even is a met
they were probably afraid of getting sued for trademark infringement by some sock company or something
and underscores
mitch who do you think will win the trophy
if you say c9
you won't get money
i hate kingdom hearts
.....
inb4 gummy asks me to predict another esports match
speaking of which idk if bringy and me have even said a word to each other today
`> text`
and that will never changed for youtube if i do let's play
that's right, $6 of my hard earned money went to that channel
hell yeah!
i just have audio issues
apparently the old hd60 hasn't come down in price any, even though it's a couple versions out of date now
not surprised
hey it's worked out for me so far
streaming was very interesting
i 100% copied eyan
that was like 2013-2015
that and i believe sneaky's stream influence me to always talk and shit
my bunny has achieved internet fame
congrats
my animal crossing wild world walkthrough part 1
it was film with a camcorder and ds taped to the wall
and he told me he would get my 3d land part 1 to 1k and in return i have to stream zelda
anthony was one of the biggest ones
they disappeared though
are you sure?
oh maybe
unless they were the same person?
knifeperson resurfaced a couple years back but nothing since then
i remember zekrom
and thepikachuguy
when did yall show up
i was there for the first stream on xy launch but i don't really remember much until the next spring or so
i started watching stream right after the transition to king of zeal
well i got into league around jan 20 2015 and i'm pretty sure zeal was responsible for that so a few months before that with the oras streams is when i first showed up
however i didn't make an account till the beginning of 2015
part of the band who sang stacy's mom
whats his name..
diemetrycare
let me look through my chat whispers
which errr
skullkidfan was a highlight
now it might be evil of me, but i don't really give a shit what skullkid did because it didn't affect me
i mean the first thing she did was defend you while everyone was poking you, so obviously
just like people who use rp commands and name themselves after video game characters
hey my name isn't name after a video game character!
dad ostensibly being tiber septim
my first username was awesomesuperpokemon, then supergamespokemon, then superskillsful, then supergummying, then gummy
hmmmmmmmmm
so it's like gummystreams, gummyac, gummy belle, gummyyyy
the only places im named gummy is discord and youtube
and thats twitter buttttt
gummy air conditioning
maybe i could turn this name into chemical symbols and be titanium praseodymium
<:skarmthink:692790214531350608>
i mean uh
except for sites that don't let you pick your username but those don't count because they suck
those sites tend to give you either something auto-generated like "timmyfelldownthewell1568954" or just cut to the chase and give you a numerical id
meanwhile spotify doesn't let you make a username and just gives you one and says "fuck off and you can't change it"
i'm pretty sure it's a gui bug that the devs demanded extra to fix
apple doesn't make me happy but at least itunes is a good media player
that's pretty stupid overhead
i have a hard time waking up in the morning. playing the song of the nation that my dad hates most for the whole house to hear should get me out of bed.
the far right vox party?
i was going to say "why is my other account typing"
sup dad
no u didn't tell me
this is currently my most popular one
mitch explain
otherwise he wouldn't make thumbnails for me
this was back in 2013
flubs marry me?
gummy the player
anything you do could work with it
blitz has been converted to piplup propaganda
if your sauce could even be referred to as gravy, you've done something terribly wrong
not trying to get sticky fingers by golly
hmm needs more ketchup
this isn't about taste gummy
he's all around us flubs
i think its fucking hailing
and effectively right, the darn things exist just to carry around
i've got 4 just to sort stuff easily
i deleted it in 2017?
imma send it death threats
damn
so i could access the create new channel
or is it .com??
close
is this true sis?
and i cant fuckin get there because someone shut the planet down
fair enough
i will not hurt my dog
my little sister ironically just said, "i want someone to choke you to death"
of you getting choked yeah
flubs why do you feel this way? what happen?
subway came to your house?
am i sweet at least?
not particularly thanks
looks better with a clean face
and like chop a live squid and ate it
it was about an hour long
prob sis
keeps spamming me in dms when they are back
in total i believe gummyland has 480 bans
i dunno why camelot never ban anthony at the start
oh that one
but it should have been more dramatic if drago banned me
let the truth slowly dawn on you
you literally were there
lol it's so nerve wracking joining a new discord server where everyone welcomes you
he joined sneaky server
no lol
cloud9 server?
so good i have no channel
thinnk this is one of the 3 vids you can hear me
i like making fun of people
2017 people made fun of me
i had extra stuff written down but the rest of it pissed me off so i deleted it
thats the whole thing
and then i move on to the other stuff
and i disappoint everyone in my life more than i did before i quit
but pls not on yt
take a guess people
so get good sleep y'all, it's good for you
oh that's the one game that shares a birthday with me or something
whats with discord trolls lately
“trypophobia is an aversion to the sight of irregular patterns or clusters of small holes or bumps.”
its called people are bored with an internet connection and no motive to read books
i rather stare at my screen and wait for a troll to join for another ban
mario bros 3 is not forgiving
gummy you should do smb1 with a death counter
do you want me to embarrass myself?
you do that already
if they ever remake bugs life it would be nightmare fuel
gummy mario ragetage when
<:dab_flutters:674908213342240768>
this time i died to big fishy
but gummy what have decided?
imma revive my chicken wings channel
i copied a lot of things that eyan did in terms of vids and username
no no no
i called myself king of slamming
nope
you're not wrong
what?
~~wait we have rules~~
no raiding
i think
we are making rules
wtf are you on about?
youre a game designer now?
but sweetie bot and carl bot should protect us
no u
keep a list of the timestamps of the last four joins
if the elapsed time is less than 10 seconds, dole out bans
one drawback of being a brony server is that we are raided hard
wooo
and said n word
then i gotta work on 4 year anniversary
guys
i have the best idea for siblings day ever!!!!
cause i have a lot of anger issues
sis's mate word rub off to me so now i say that sometimes lol
i wonder if flubs is okay
it's not a germ though
walked in and wanted to rob us??
i know it was a few of you guys but exactly sure which ones
> eu, i think venice
everyone was like whatever
this is neat
i'm everywhere
but not enough
this ain't much a community
also im not good at helping others
im dead
no kidding, me too
so guys
and he is excited that a sheep is his neighbour
sis is real server owner
um what did you do
kitty!
camo cat
the answer to that is yes
what constitues "too hot" in iceland
if you can afford to move to iceland just for that, you probably don't need any extra time off
yeah except for the part where they have snow on the ground until may
only complaints are lack of mcdonald’s
wtf is this from 2016?
though finding a stable friend group back was hard
i had to find people who don't mind me being insane
good times
also guys
bad news
biden would be... okay
im more worry that his scandals will be an issue during office for him
better than trump
gummy i take it you're new to the republican party
the  worry about it after
but many bernie sanders supporters refuse to vote now
biden has to win first and now i don't see that as a likely thing
if you can only find one you'll have to share
now i see why most people don't care about politics or get invested in it
how dare you gender assume piplup
all the days end in r
it just shows what we have to go through in terms of voting
oh it must be fake because it isn't verified
and he made the confederate flag a pattern
so i'm not very big on putting that online
i had more faith in eyan playing tbh since i assume you don't like games like that
and i thought i was the strange brother
well im happy you tried it
granted i can argue bits about the confederates but i would never make a flag like that
that would have beennnn wayyy worse
i don't think  they're above that tbh
i won't be shocked if fox fires chris for this
democracy is hard, yall
"america is messed up"
if the party themselves actually did the voting behind the scenes they would most likely pick yang as the party leader
demon lord
oh no
go on
they now have 2 more siblings
wait they're redoing the teletubbies???
well then
i'm more shocked max and ruby has a reddit
oh gummy i think that pokemon egg ash got in gen 8 ended up being a riolu and not a starter
i heard
well alola didn't have an established pokémon league so we'll see how he does in galar
im telling you demon lord
i also heard that if a deceased [male] family member has permission from the family, they can ||insert a rod into the anus of the deceased, shock the prostrate and have the deceased ejaculate for a sperm sample.||
we are stealing this emote
my sister said the same thing
you at least express some emotions
you don’t want to see that
what’s homestuck day?
never ever mentioned you use to root for a rival team in your favourite esports team discord server
that can apply to anything
anyways here you go
data structures, diff eq, circuit analysis, physics 2
almost msgs sis when i meant to msg here
much better
and have me troll them
that moment when i'm more in favor of states' rights than the republicans
fun fact: when angela met with trump he refused to shake her hand which made the situation awkward for everyone
canadians prob take joy in watch trump be dumb along with every nation that isn't the usa
western canada threaten to leave canada for states several timesp
western canada want a trump like leader
not sure where america has most oil pits
texas
i can imagine if trudeau loses he has to resign as party leader
if trudeau does what he did during the 2016 elections
well it's because trudeau only has a minority government now
anyways some literally packed up their shit
and walk through the border
these people literally left the stuff they had
i go with the party i agree with the most
i agree with either ndp or green the most in canada
isn’t new jersey democrat??
mitch lives in the state with the two-letter postal code
nj, ny, ct, ma, ms, me, md, de, va, nc, sc, etc
people were protesting when liberals won
no just for the rest of yors
bringina is already planning to take out my kneecaps
drago you said this about sis that one time and that never happened
conservatives no climate change
so what you're saying is, there's a 0.000000013157895% chance that it's gummy
is it pizza?
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooookay
"i live in fucking austria" is like the oldest joke in profane linguistics
whats worse is this moose apparently acts like a dumbass
indiana
omegalul
you also said that about flubs
i was looking at twitter when all a sudden this was recommended for me to follow...what is this?
people reminiscing about the dumb stuff they did on the internet when they were 11
err guys
back in the day i drank a lot of coffee as you can remember, now i haven't touch a cup in months
lol i remember
now it's milkshakes
no one can stop me
but somehow youtube allows it
look at this
demonlord i agree
i'd try to calculate the samllest by doing 10! and removing the numbers that are factors of other numbers, like 2 and 3
and gum
what have i done?...
> i'd try to calculate the samllest by doing 10! and removing the numbers that are factors of other numbers, like 2 and 3
yes i agree drago
that's so crazy that i stopped reading halfway through. let me try again
didn't kirby inhale a pea in the anime
but i figure it wasn't worth it if i play on 1080p
just import google api to do it
clearly they're not using python's technique for strings where you can do "1"+"0"*10000
what were you getting before
windows calculator cares (probably)
what on earth are you doing if you can't get 1080p on a 2070
2070 is better for 1440p
the performance of computing equipment is kinda logarithmically related to the price
and he casually threw one away
i meant ryzen 7 but yeah that's a good example
the one i fried
a 10 core, 20 thread 9900x would be... interesting
not super ideal but i'm good at using it so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i need an english person
also i'm currently struggling to figure out how to make gravity work because i haven't had to deal with it in about 3-4 years
anyways for skullkid context, i was looking at that twitter i found this morning and i remember scatman vid because they mention it
lmfao you got it
it's on tip of my tongue
good ol days
will has fallen into the person 5 royal hole, and we may never hear from her again as a result
that’s horrible
league is better
also speaking of old days and stuff since animal man is here
alright i have a serious question
good
guys in my artificial intelligence class i finally get to play with data and i'm so happy
that makes sense
you guys are no fun
coding it didn't take me until midnight, it took me less than an hour
it also means people need to come up with new jokes about ai that aren'r "if if if if if if if if if if if if if if"
this virus has affected everyone in some way, i wouldn't worry too much about it
though granted this time around
lol who am i kidding, why let a little linear regression get in the way of an outdated joke
and it's been confirmed by him on stream that did happen
god, why must you do this with such regularity
you all ruined my fun this morning with your terrible voting about if i should get a gummy shirt or jacket
i'd get fucking decked
but that's okay
probably
yeah i'm just wondering cause i plan on getting terraria and eyan said he would gift me but i guess he won't be able to
guys
and my dad bought a air pistol
unless i let trolls in
then again only 3 trolls have joined here
guys
today i will teach you all something important
don't worry i know how to chew my food
the purple lunatic girl
theres a lot, well i have two daysish to play a bit, guess i have to restart but i'll get through fine
ah, sir piercings
he does that a lot
big part is the introductions of all the characters
oof i also wanna play final fantasy as well
that's a stupid deal
because she constantly stalks my twitter for info
why are u just now knowing who dr phil is
he seems like a bad one
woah i just watched a dr phil clip of a mom abusing her kid for lying by putting hot sauce in his mouth and giving him a cold shower
i think antonio brown would be better on live tv than him
no he's a coward
im still stunned you have literally never heard of dr phil lol
she used to be hair stylist and always cut hair for her family and for my little side and dad but i always refused
but now i cannot get my hair cut
anyone want to guess what this is for
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
cos t
i'd offer to try to webex support into it, but i'm not sure if i can do that into non-university computers with the license we have on that
is he seeing just the command prompt or is the windows hellscape all there?
he says on installing chrome
he says when he opens chrome this pops up
“chrome will launch as soon as the installation finishes” but never does upon installation and still wont launch, he even tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it and doesn't work
1909 is the most recent major update for windows 10
speak for yourself
okay the only not-stupid answer i can find on google is try running the system file checker tool (`sfc /scannow`) and see if it finds the installation to be broken or something
yeah ok it seems like any support sessions created with webex will be logged to ensure company use. there goes that idea
run is  for when you want your batch scripts to return something useful
well thats bollocks
youd think they might as well, since windows 10 home isn't what they make their money on anyway
any luck with firefox?
the wind scares him
also tell him to show file extensions, hidden files, empty drives, merge conflicts, and maybe turn off autoplay
but yeah you're right it should fall into the actually useful category that is a package manager
update the man fixed it
the problem was ||he didnt update his friggin computer when he thought he did|| but before clicking the spoiler take one final guess as to what it could possibly be and see if you were right
i failed the whole try to sleep thing
i know him
mb on wording
there's normal, which, for dungeons, means it's just a dungeon, with trials means ezpz, and with raids means kinda rough but pretty normal (except with the coils which are definitely not normal level difficulty)
and then there's ultimate.....
i mean i knew i'd like them but they always intimidated me
blitz
well last week on easter we ordered pizza and i gave the pizza guy a good tip cos he delivered our pizza and was cool about it despite the whole covid-19 stuff and the fact it was easter
i had pizza tonight as well
weird name but yeah
and that correction on the pizza box isnt fake at all
im surprise he doesn't get tired from howling
guess what charlie is doing
imma watch this beautiful piece of work
hopefully i don't bore you to death
they will still vote him
it prob won't happen but i would like it if joe biden picks michelle obama as vp
i deleted it lol
biden might pick a latino due to the latin vote
are you enjoying it?
you could never
but it was funny reaction
you should watch my vids drago
blitz never watches my vids
but the power of editing
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
i was talking about earbuds with people in a server
and i remember once, my little sister tried to playfully strangle me with the cable of a broken earbud once
though all were a joke according to her
the most interesting one was her chainsawing a mcdonalds logo and it hitting me and slicing my head off
ur mum is a weapon to surpass metal gear
wtf a shooting in nova scotia
exactly
i've seen shootings in canada before but it's at a pace where if one happens you go omg but if one happens in the usa you essentially say here we go again while going omg
i think we might have like
can i move there?
i feel offended
okay that guy copypasted the same reply to like a dozen people
guys i hurt myself again
im limping
my little sister just robbed me
that's just what happens during the apocalypse gummy
i hate discrete math
one of my neighbors was a math major back in ancient history and apparently she had to once do a proof for "proving that real numbers exist"
i tried looking up some basic lighting algorithms not too long ago and i found some pdfs that said "to implement a lighting algorithm, you first need to define the parameters with which the rules for creating the universe will be based upon"
and to that the only reasonable response is to put them against the wall right next to the environmentalists who protested disaster area
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
i'm hyped
kugal pet doggo
no you don't
last time i uploaded was today
drago, there this streamer that was insulting her viewers
i should work on my next yt video, but mitch
never heard of it
it wasn't some what's up kiddies nonsense
bringina sighs\
huge problem if i play adc, cause gummy in lane is really bad right now
even though he frown on me over youtube
unless you were to have joined zeal server
maybe i wouldn't be so clingy like i am
well you made mine better ❤️
so most interesting thing i heard ever
my mom once again said if obama or clinton was president and corona happened, it would have killed everyone in usa and that the usa should be thankful for trump
never blames himself he does what we tell our children not to do and points the finger at others
help
like pennsylvania, there's no reason why everyone in the state is required to wear a mask
that's not much of a defense
you fail to understand how far our standards have fallen
"imma slice you into pieces, and feed your limbs to cannibals and the dog pound" - little sister
ayyyy
i feel like shit today
but that would defeat the point of you giving me free stuff
i have discovered something amazing
no better time to start than the present, then
loopy said that original 3ds capture boards will be back soon, however he won't sell any preinstall ones
you would have to send it in
at that point i might as well just emulate it but i like having a physical thingy
north korea loves him
funny how south korea is one of the most technologically advanced countries and north korea is stuck in the middle ages
did i hear middle ages?
south korea though i hear is actually fun to visit
he believes kim jong un should run canada
they also agree all people from prisons need to die
that’s actually what it really says
schools are brainwashing people into liberals
he and a few co workers
trump would be the one to say that lol
oh no corona is in nova scotia
the shooting
there was another shooting???
tbh the prison thing here is prob true
good lord
for the animal crossing people of course
what's the news
yeah
too much root beer again
yes pretty much
and msg me
now this wasn’t the scary part
also gummy belle shouldn't be gone unless she got deleted or if you logged into the wrong account somehow
normally it’s whatever
and checking my friends list she definitely doesn't look deleted
oh god, these fps
welcome to my world
remember your carbuncle friend
how long have you been standing there?
ah yes
as in
woah
you should also have waypoints on your map for where those quests take you
there should be an icon in your quest log that you can click
you can also just interact with the location
and it'll bring up your key items
nvm, it worked
the quest log should be able to tell you
you have summoned statistics
oh yes, i did that once
show me a screenshot of your character select screen
level 8
what level is drago on?
okay im getting to 10 tomorrow
nice
you'll have the rest of the class hunting you down with pitchforks and torches if there's a curve you threw off for them
(i was there when i took the fps screenshot)
next semester im hoping i can do diff eq but i may not becuase im for some reason not eligible to enroll in any classes despite registeration period being open
why not?
no i've made like 10 of these videos cos my friends told me to set up funny mic
and damn it sis, you weren't supposed to look in this channel where im being roasted hard
ah drago was my ultimate rival then
me winning in subs in 2014
guys
fun fact
<:ppinkiejoy:399725095964246019>
gummy after the whole walkthrough thing failed first time
then i realized i was camera shy
you ruined a hot dog
however you haven't tried top 10 videos
i'm considering it lol
....what is this?!
then i shall defeat you
why do i feel like demon lord would defeat me?
no nsfw
supporting biden would just be an acceptance of the status quo politicians he's been raging against for over a year
why would i destroy my channel?
the golden era of jrpgs
but yeah the gba version came out like 3 years after the ds so not many people even knew it was thing
hmmm
how am i supposed to play gummy belle in that game?
too hard
how many notes will you make demon lord?
of course now you've made me aware of that so that will help me out as well xd
whats the channel gonna be called?
haven't figured that out yet
for the first in my life
it's on steam
the thing is even if trump had a good opinion you can't take it seriously because he is never straightforward
the governor of georgia has gotta be one of the stupidest men alive if trump disagrees with him
what about the person who described themself
nooooo
but doesn't care
and back then he wanted to one day get eyan average viewer
it was during a terraria stream i think
ignorant
i would like corphish to beat sneaky's average one day though
professor acidentally gave me 100/10 in the grade book so my grade is 156.28% right now
is stream style is different than mine
at least you guys actually have a plan in order
meanwhile our plan is like reopen blahblahblah
after what i saw on twitter
the place where i live
germany isn't crazy in fact i it's very lgbt friendly
they still have a nazi party like thing there
germany and me wouldn’t get along well
nope
not anymore
i'm glad i don't have a copy of your bucket list
it’s called a joke mitch!!!
many people close to stormy said august 1st will be hard
gonna be honest that is kinda scary
oh boy
"junko more like junk, oohhhh!"
since steam doesn't wanna work with this thing now
> on your laptop?
say it out loud
hmm, i don't even know if i have the energy to roulette
who?
him sis
dad: [describes a thing from history]
brother: where did you learn that? do you have sources?
help
people
there we go
so much
“pro tip #1
“that's exactly what terrible members of our sponsorship program try to do.  they create an account, don't try the drinks themselves, then proceed to post "go score some rogue energy and save 10% with code xyz!" all over their twitter. “
i said a waffle tasted like beef
but it does taste like beef
that explains why he gets donations every minute
alright
or how come there's both crystal and hgss?
they just left out bw for no good reason
while there's tons of remakes in there
i kinda like black and white more
s&m are obsolete, b2w2 were actual sequels
it wasn't a seperate story, it was an upgraded story
only black and white were unique
xy ain't bad
though b2w2 is a very close second
sorry gummy
im reporting your youtube channel
i thought you would be using this
the quality on gamecube is only so high anyway
idk that might be a thing
yeah i'm considering that
i may even do a smaller game without commentary at first just to get a feel for things
there's no way i'm investing in 3ds capture software
pretty hard to come by at this point anyway
i'll sell it for you for 2k
and that was mostly a joke
it is from that era, yes
i would say
idk what a small game is
i prefer living in monarchy like country
no wait i lied
also that woman that abused her cats on twitch stream apparently had a nip slip and still not banned
okay so i might be shit at youtube
but im good at giving advice about it
well just like what demon lord said, how final fantasy 6 is gonna be the best project
alright, why were there failed attempts on pokemon platinum?
and another on another youtube
without all the notes
earthbound?
think everyone already knew that
but i failed that as well
it’s kinda cool you know someone who became popular
it’s easier for me with talking to corphish cause i knew him for a long time when he was like a nobody
that's good
im kinda drunk after waffles
what could go wrong there
it's not much but i always wanted something like this to see what it's like
that is not relaxing
i suppose
i forgot speedrunning was a thing
wait
goes on twice a year
oh..
games done quick is way more corporate so that's what makes me suspicious
nah i really don't
so hide the ugly stuff in 360p gotcha
i guess the other thing is, if you want to put text on the screen and stuff it'll look like a video with 480p text on it if you don't make the video frame size big
like i said
she is close to him
she looks like lawful evil versus chaotic evil
what am i?
chaotically chaotic
well you are...i have no idea
well there's two axis on this
and i can't quite place you on good
lmao
i don't think im evil or good
then again i didn't know it was christian
and where does playing league of legends all day fall on the alignment chart?
final fantasy on chaotic neutral
that would explain why i can't fully be good
the good news is
i mean the good thing is it’s helping children
that would be the ideal circumstance. as long as the vatican doesn't take a 20% cut of your donation before it gets to the kids anyway
from what i read
im watching someone bite someone on stream
what?
i witness someone who donated $500 to corphish earlier and now i just witnessed someone else do another $500...
he must have really passionate fans if they're willing to donate that much to him
either that or they're just very rich lol
well a number of them are out there still
though like mitch said
a good number of them are still around but view modern eyan with a degree of ire
and i hate leeching off of people
it’s not like all a sudden you talk to like chugga where you are nervous and everything
i like earning shit
oh come on that was a clean kill
tbh im considering streaming csgo...
drago don't answer that
ping me
when it happens
i think ponyfest closing ceremonies are coming up soon
you would have to compete with babscon
ah yes
he's a dj that's currently playing
only $50 per ticket
and everyone can enjoy both
in that exact order
figured
im 53 kg
that was when i was 16
why didn't you share?
you realize she has the same name on discord and is on this server right,
there we go
bad!
mitch i like to see you do better
<:sads2:625971430097420288>
kugal every time you shorten "because" to "cos" my brain automatically assumes you're talking about the function that offsets sine by a quarter rotation
i have common sense too!
you know i love 10/10 customer server, salt, ew to the rest of what you ate though
i swear most random people join or who know me ask me this stuff
should i tell them my secret is to do nothing and let mods do all the work?
basic high school coding
it'll be interesting to see how galaxy plays without motion controls
they could do what they did with the world ends with you where they have motion controls for the docked mode and touch screen for bottom
but rumours only
so i challenge demon lord to mario galaxy wlakthrough
if i don't get bored after intro
is that the shortcut that makes the desktop rotate or something
most don't seem to need motion controls
oh on discord
wait who is rudy
youre probably thinking of bloomberg
and every tweet is about him lol
that would be awesome!
i'm not sure if i like the sound of that
and yeah you would know the series
took my cash and credit cards and tried to destroy my mouse as a joke
is it pokemon demon lord?
so it would be a lot easier to organize than final fantasy
never played golden sun but i've heard a fair bit about it over the years
it's still turn based
the problem with bravely isn't that the bosses are long, the problem is that you need to do ng+ four times
i was seriously bad at the first two first though, that doesnt count
i'm confuzled
alternatively, i beat gummy by not quitting on episode 15
if a series doesnt hit triple digits does it even count
since you have to beat four swords and that requires multiple systems and copies of the game
mitch
who’s side are you on?
i'm low key fukt up rn
because splitting up community and stuff
besides no nsfw
well...
my little sister for yours
well it finally got mentioned in a vid but they mention my name of course instead of my mom...prob because of the paypal
me too
i have the same shock as trump saying something dumb
or else i will buy you a league account!
laptop with shit internet to watch spider man
quarantine is over
im good at the game
gummy belle gummy belle
this is gummy drugs btw
i was right
mitchhh
bragging rights sound nice
oh come on sis
or is it just me feeling it?
and that i errr
subs are something i actually wouldn't want if i go forward with this let's play
7 transformers
damn ir
wow that sentence was good
you guys remember bingo for the gba?
oh damn it
fuck that shit
also im stuck still at a part in that game
i knew this would happen
when did this turn into anime
i hate anime
mostly everyone*
episode one, taking back the server!
fine i’ll make it cartoon
so i wont
what should i watch sis?
wait this isnt applied math club
do you ever just
```c
int r(){
  return r;
}
```
demon lord biggg news
i would watch mha with gummy
to celebrate
i shall binge watch all 7 seasons of max and ruby
whaaat
you would think people would be using them when a shooting happens
they are better automatically due to less shootings in canada
comparing it to the usa is valid
that's a good thing
this ban will not stay
next election
ontario seems to always vote liberal
and ndp
i'm looking at the map
yeah they did win the popular vote
in regina
2016?
nisqy or something
if by vote you mean prob having to mail in my vote which will most likely be a crap shoot in how fair it is
but i don't think the most written in nominee has been on an esports team, though they do have a twitch stream
yeah biden doesn't seem to have the energy to take on trump i feel
my point is that they don't care enough about removing trump
bkuz its a gud game
only intro is good
are you still disappointed im me?
today has been a mix of awesome and irritating already lmao
this cartoon didn’t treat kids like kids, they understood kids knew what murder was like
i mean i could make this cartoon
yeah i understand
wait
i actually learnt to read
cause if we go with sis time then about....6 pm for me
now i can legally graduate
then i go insane
have you had rice porridge?
thats my weakness, sooo drago, you better not pull that on me one day
blitz get out\
do you want me to suffer?
i didn’t think you would actually be mad at me...
seeing how much you can get out of f2p without spending money is a fun metagame
apparently if he had read how to discord screenshare, we would have sound for a long while now
happy birthday!
night
i have bad news
<a:ponksad:525086852638572555>
silly gum
people will take what they can get in quarantine
it goes to the vveb guide or something
fuckin keyboard
since your hotbar's unlocked you can just drag it off the hotbars
my nickname applies a bit to me now huh
outside of the tank classes, the mele classes are
since it's best to understand how dungeons work before going tank
i think i want tank
yeah, i will stick to magic sis
and wait till i got the hang of it first
also my new theme
neat
i was about to ask what you were talking about demon lord
yeah told you i forget fast
twitter
and i found that
yeah but why
2andahalfstooges
whos brian?
i found one thing
will do
while for streaming
prob close to $100
all of it came from demon lord
same thing
as for twitch, it's random and well prob demon lord gave me the most even though i tell him not to
i prob did both
demon lord
because i couldn’t monetize it for a month
your first mistake was attempting to monetize your vids
as much as i like sun and moon
how much?
so i had to learn about the game fast and well
dang
wow im washed up
you know
drago i think i had 14 and photoshop 15, but then i upgraded to 2017?
for that matter
then again
basically for my mario walkthroughs
2. let it murder you in the face
koopas
well i think covering a link to the past will be quite fun
i've only beaten the game once thus far
demon lord it's a _final fantasy_
i'm the zelda nerd here after all lol
link to the past is a game i could learn a lot faster than an rpg
probably
oh yeah
i gotta make sure my switch capture card works
didnt you already
you were there
nope
but sometimes we do get frame drop
boom
but nothing bad
but i wasn't sure what to pick
yeah wouldn't make much of a difference
i also saw this one
candyman, inferno was also in chat
i vaguely remember that name
drago how about you lp all the final fantasy games
why are you tormenting me?
becasue it's funny
ebf5, bravely default ii, sword kinda, elder scrolls 6 if that ever comes out before i die
there's usually very little cut out so even a moderately long vm takes a looooooong time to do a lets play of
visual novels
why did i let him get away with it?
but also, they're fun
tbh doing visual novels kinda pushes the boundary of "are lets plays copyright infringement" closer to "yes" because there's less interaction with them
this has been the longest time since i started to buy pokemon
im very excited to do plat and oras though
mitch
right?
where i haven't gotten the newest game
my internet at apartment works fine with 720p
that being said
someone in nova scotia
there you are
should be illegal
no joke
is canada so jealous of america's being the laughing stock of planet earth that theyre starting to feel competitive or something
would make the point of climate change obsolete
just give western canada oil and more jobs or something then they will be fine
we had people run like that before
doug ford being an example
and praise
hes like mini trump
i can see trump destroying a lot of places
i can just picture trump destroying canada if he ruled
you can be conservative and not be a jackass it's just trump has made it seem that way
dictator
quick mitch, what colour shall the party be
wasn’t there an eyan 2020 campaign?
wait that’s a bad idea
i'm not running
gummy is stalking me
help
call it inspection
island inspection what is this lol
cause you never finish or play a game well
why is youtube telling me drago uploaded something?
i mean i have seen liberals who are pro gun
i have
i think
he wants me to be like that one guy he knows that makes games
because that guy earns 5k a month
wanna be youtube rivals again?
time to relax and watch my fave streamer
people
mostly b though
the real question is why are you up
~~play final fantasy 15~~
cloudace
#9615
what are the odds?
they banned my google+ not youtube
my youtube was force connected to it
but so far nothing on me
so im sticking to twitch
twitch as of late obviously doesn't have a great track record for bans
stormy hated my cids
why didn't you just upload clips from your twitch streams to a youtube channel
fuck that
but i cannot commentate on game well
he also constantly clickbaits
idk as a streamer i always worried i am boring
he's a pretty good dude
nor basically any community besides maybe mlp and league
no he's not
always picking a fight
joe merrick
guys
oh boy
i see
they're starting to ease restrictions now
i have that weird urge
i got to see a spreadsheet eyan was working on last night
whatever comes into mind, i do
i should exercise as well
then again i react to things differentyl
yeah i don't know how i would even begin to go about that
these days i follow what i think of first
i keep saying x and y after plat
then boom oras comes to play
it's not for me
my bad luck streak is still going
about the info in mario
i am gonna show you something
there was more?
i quickly typed that out btw
i would even be more boring then an eyan league stream
then yes...there would be more
you know something
can’t do that in city with lots of people
centrist
i always was lol
yeah
how would you like it if your capture card threw _you_ around! i bet you wouldn't like that, would you!
my sister once threw my 3ds capture card
only emerald and firered
one of the few times i was really angry at her
is the premier the mayor or something
yeah my bad lol
of course the nra would say that
hes back....
congress has to approve both of those or something. it's not going to be used so it doesn't really matter
does anyone even remember this youtuber
old school poketuber mitch
i see
eyan somehow comes back 2 weeks later
.....
hmmm
the truth hurts
nice
"i'm a tweet lil' bird in a gilded cage, tweety's my name but i don't know my age, i don't have to worry and that is that, i'm safe in here from that old puddy-tat"
oh my god my name looks wrong for that
15 questions is not enough to accurately measure someone's understanding of english
also sis
well...
close enough
thats ok colleges don't grasp that concept either and hence the sat exists
tbh i was opposed to the idea of a politics channel here because i don't believe politics should have a place in this server
yay anarchy
politics has made me want to leave this server about 10 times
if we can then maybe you guys will enjoy server more
im so happy lueroi is back tbh
just going through stuff
shittt
i am?
what woes thee?
inb4 meme vector fields
we are gonna try the channel and see if we can reduce it in this channel
is it a nightmare...no
i could tell blitzypoo last night
reason why i wanted to accommodate for you is because i had a feeling others felt the same way
that's still too much though
i moved it down
there can be no fairly moderated discussion in a channel of that nature
this is a very realistic dream though
you have a point
blitz i need a new intro
how tragic
i'm only counting streams, not videos
i still wouldn't mind seeing you play ct, it's fun
plus i remember you saying it reminded you a bit of pokémon
idk, it doesn't interest me enough to stream it on twitch
i finally saw the guy who my dad says makes games
she looks like taller drago
someone explain this to me like im a 5 year old
it's a game with buttons and things of the likes of which
idk blitzypoo...doesn't seem like my style
what is a chrono trigger/
makes sense
i made her an editor of channel
what type of fan am i drago?
is this a dependency or a habit
think i will succeed?
to possibly fail
noooooo
i keep losing and not having fun anymore
i really like ffxiv though because i can be relax when i play it
and i always wanted to bond more with sis
i say just reasses your happiness with the choice you made, if you're happy that's all the matters gumbotron
and negative stuff come from it
eh i’ll start playing more ffxiv, hopefully catch up to sis’s level and fight a dragon
people
it's intel from 2017 what did you expect
for the stat line to be a bit better than my fx 4350
though i'd guess the 7700 has hyperthreading and 4350 doesnt
time to go to
the second walmart
if you fail that one, then maybe emphasis on the cry in crystal
i saw something amazing
we were assigned to make a ted talk in english
darn
i have no idea what to do with mine
uhhhhhhh
which pi model do you have nightshade
at one point i had seven hard drives in varying forms floating around my room
i know one of them's died and i'm not sure the whereabouts of at least two of them though
i can feel your disappointment radiating through the screen
probably should stream ffxiv then
gummy being here isn't an complaint btw, i told drago that like 7 times
but that still leaves six though
the drop seems to have killed it
it was a pentium wasnt it
same
you said you hated amd about 18 seconds ago
i should probably bring my pc in to work every three months to give it a nice dust removal with the actual quality air compressor there
that requires effort
but if i commit like i did
i need the extra money for toys
the sockets are different so you're not really deeply invested for an upgrade
im a toy collector
xenoblade chronicles
it is 1:40am
x: y: and z: are actually just subst drives that redirect to various locations on c:
noooooo
lmao gummy
gummy i'm literally a twentysomething year old living in my mom's dungeon
people look at my funny
idk why
they're just macro definitions ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
that violent!
a programmer has a problem, and they decide to solve it using threads. two problems have now they.
what i don't go on reddit ar all
if /r/programmerhumor can get away with it so can i
double nope
wait i don't think i can banned her
only children play minecraft!
there's a scene from yes man where javascript roasts everyone
but i never claimed to be
and then on the complete opposite end of your program you pick up the reference by sheer coincidence
michael
it’s almost 12
aaaaaand just like that my computer loses internet
i consider inviting her here but prob not best idea
i don't even bite that hard
not literally dead
well i bump into cloudace the other day
is "telehone pole" a  valid personality trait
what else?
but nightshade is tougher
there’s no..clear design for this
i already kinda understand you from watching speech patterns and stuff
sooo yay
okay my internet's back and i got to finish watching the javascript roasting video
i want in on this
wouldn't this be a test pattern and not speech
i would kill to play xy right now
ahhhhhh
ur mum's planning crazy shit
just a tad
yeah lol
i think i know how to design nightshade's oc now...
i see
sorry man i dont have any disposable monies
but but toy
i already sold both amd and intc so i dont really care what you goofs buy now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
math likes to call this an absolute win
oh crap
mitch move your arms! kick with your legs!
currently at 963k
scott the woz is almost at a million subs i believe
very nice
watch this
for the first time in my life
is it already
also i noticed something recently
and always hyper
i swear to god...
he already did though demon lord
so i feel like he will get revenge
i can't imagine the writers giving ash a legendary though
ash commanded 3 legendaries in an x and y movie
i guess
you could be right
there is a reason why i put faith in ash even though he loses
plus he helped a lot of pokemon, for example, he took in paul's chimchar who was abused because paul wanted chimchar to master blaze but did it in an abuse way that hurt chimchar
he also understood froakie
i thought u never watched hoenn gummy
same with battle froniter
as for black and white
and it became less stubborn
as for sword and shield
gengar was abandon by it's trainer
he doesn't deserve shit!
ash had to beg nurse joy to sign the guy in the league
how about you don't watch black and white at all
i don't remember my 2014 password
let's see copy of mario galaxy and the sequel for good measure
a piplup plush which would cause pain and also scare him to death
i've been told i sound a lot like bill wurtz
watch good stuff
honestly kinda want to get to silver and quit for good
youve been saying you were going to stop for about three years now
thought you would be interested
i heard 2 was decent
the day gummy stops playing league is the day pigs fly
i seen 1 btw
oh wait did i start this
i suppose guns and ships are acceptable though
holy shit...
drago nooooo don't aboose your mons
and i was basically like nope not firing
oh my this is nothing like a musket
oh well time to play final fantasy
i was supposed to recover tools from pirates
yes i can return to the thingy thingy
but i rather wait
and a
"i can't leave you alone for like 3 minutes and this is what happens?!"
omg that was amazing
oh...
there is some toxicity in this game but not the same type as in league
guess i gotta make it more toxic
what ida is trying to say is that she's better at sucking than you
better
question
well
okay thanks, well shit...
no fair
yeah that's the maximum allowed level
not the required one
don't stand in the cho'gath q
wouldn't bother with more than 3 personally
okay thanks
lmao
i understand my two poisons
since i saw how it can tick down
doesn't work for things like stuns but it works for poisons
the game explains it later
yeah a lot of the info early in the game is something the player isn't very equipped to understand
nah i am good for now
if it wasn't the actual moon
but i understood what she was looking at
can i get a lift back to farms?
how i get off?
thanks for the ride sis!
in rooms are now available
nice
also
errr that link australian person
maybe
but what i don't like is, that the second you say something that might sound wrong
they jump on you fast
yet somehow people consider me a good player
in your guild
thanks
whats that
applying the appearance of other equipment onto your equipment
that's without glamour
do you have a favourite?
the current one is the glamour
i managed to fire like 5
you mean this one?
for me i really like your pirate one
well i do like it a lot, especially since it cost me 2 million gil to make
magic is a reference to final fantasy character btw
deselect this to hide your hat
ohhh
and how do you arms fold?
lets see if i can find it
i did?
okay so pose in emotes
i look weird
which means i can now also poke sis
night sis! *hugs*
this is the greatest troll video ever made
or only me?
i'm prob going to just keep my flag the default one lol
i don't have time to use an app
misty is upset over the gun ban
hmmm
g'night
it’s very rare to see someone who is lgbt friendly that is conservative
i shall pick up a 2ds xl capture card
they're nuns how lewd could they possibly be
have you ever asked her why she identifies as conservative
pepto
pepo!
gee can't wait
drago
you all can't even pretend to compete with the programmer shirts, just saying
i actually knew about that pikachu no drama shirt while watching a pokemon center vlog
well not really but still
meetch
my little sister wants to use bb gun to kill me
it’s his bb gun
so carry on
i'm sharing the greatness
with your host, animal man
they are very important
i mean
quack
oh wtf
i think that was ida
maybe this belongs in <#643272338279890954>
here's me making time work again
more gummy quotes
getting wacked with a spoon
also like 30% of my phone's entire camera roll is stupid moments from chat
what cpu did you get?
especially the “disappointment in you” emote
floor there isn't very charming
i mean i've had splattered shit fly into my mouth so it's just like
that doesn't count
i wonder if it's possible
as in
it barely functions
speaking of sheeps though
the difference is the intent behind them
but thats very rare
then it's the normal one, not the shark one
the end of an era
some must end faste rthan others
or somewhere in between
sounds like you need a break
try playing guitars isntead
fun fact since we are talking about music
i think everytime someone talks about my username
i need a new username...
okat
well im already getting mad at this show
what is that pose
/huh
that's what it looks like if you apply the ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ animation rig to a skinned mesh
so none of them care about your safety
say it's not a joke
what gummy has is mental problems, his sister is something else entirely
i also have mental issues, i don't like my little sister
im honestly not even kidding, youd probably be justified in making a complaint at the police or a social worker or something at this point
(admittedly that might be illegal but)
wouldn't make a difference
it's not hard to go from "hey i'm not punching you that hard" to "it's not like i have a gun to your head" to "look it's not even a real gun" to "why are you complaining, the real gun isn't even pointed at you" to "bang"
hmm well college was part it
living by yourself looking after your little sister made me a bit more responsible
and i respect sis more then parents because she doesn't constantly pressure me with stuff
sounds familiar
i did like 20 practice problems today and they took me an unreasonable length of time and were very often answered wrong
my advice is take breaks as to  not pound your skull into a wall cos this shit is so goddamn easy to fuck up
you are stress
i’ll be online in final fantasy soon
so much for that
did he die
sorry was eating dinner
drago log in
alright currently logging in
we never found the body
grats
it's a level 60 raid
oh sis
never mention unova here
so purple/blue quest are important right?
i got two of them
k'lyhia
bad news sis
but i can't do my quest
cause fate
nvm i ran
im in a weird town now
should i teleport back?
okay
i should register for all of them then..
this thing is fun
who is saying this stuff to me!!
the level 10 quest? i don't remember where that is, maybe in lower la noscea
i can teleport but i don't wanna waste my money
you can use the city aethernet to teleport to places inside and just outside the city
oh yeah
does that cost anything?
welp
you going to come as well?
and then i have trouble avoiding bomb blast
not this one
where's your main story quest? >.>
well if you remember where it is
would probably have been better to accept the quest tbh
all the npcs are in all of them
holy shit
this place
my pose is that
no clue
i wanna see your house!
yippie
actually i like this song
also yes dragonsong is one of my favorite songs
though the song before
soo...i technically did managed to arrive at your house so where do i camp out?
it's still answers
also im totally the taller one in the game
wait i do have dragonsong i just didn't put it in
nope
i got into the habit of doing that
also i managed to screenshot the sequel before you left
two siblings waiting for drago to come in so we can beat him up
woooo
requirement for that quest seems to be
also level 14
are forbidden to be mention here
sounds good
well out of everything i head
help i was asleep for two hours
clearlly, the question to
you're going to have to start regulating your use of the number 14 otherwise there might not be any left for tomorrow
i'll start regulating it on may 14th
i slept 14 hours today
i guess i will set up a tent somewhere outside to camp out
i feel like i'm goign to have to call someone on the phone and start asking why my cpu appears to be on its way back to california
if you want to get back to your questing you'll have to teleport back
gather two million gil first, reach level 50 and get the rank second lieutenant
then the nightmare begins
gummy belle in the cut scenes
sunk cost fallacy is "i've already put so much effort into killing twelve youtube channels but i feel like i'm really close to succeeding"
<:skarmthink:692790214531350608>
thats me with animal crossing
how do i return?
it's the button next to teleport
im gonna log off
np i had fun
you rang
mitch you are my new youtube manager
we are returning!
i need to warn susan
noooo sis whyyyy
may as well get to it now
many questioins
sad day blitzypoo
also my skin is astrotrain
sad but happy
for real tho
>  smart people don't make mistakes because they're smart
smart people don't make the same mistake twice
they make it four or five times so they can really get the hang of what not to do
and then they do a/b testing with similar mistakes so they can try to predict the behavior that will not be a mistake
which means science hates the double pendulum
except for the chaos theorists but we mostly keep them confined to the one office down the hall that nobody goes in ever
ah cool
i have two extra rooms now
today i finished setting up the 3 houses
you can move them later btw
because i been with parents for over a month
guys today i learned i don't know excel nearly as well as i thought i did
close enough
converting previously functional programming code to object-oriented code is fun
also drago
what is this?
you have a new icon?
gummy i already otld you about that
who gave you rabaon's deathcap?
i'm not the one who put the hat on wizardragon
then again i keep telling everyone im a decent adc
yes nightshade eat
also guys
my god gummy why
fred is great btw
also copyright is not the right word
git branched?
i mean...i didn’t say that
<:pinkie_awkward_smile:636655055134785558>
yeah
yeah for example there was drat— [dragonite has been removed from this plane of existence]
i think at one point there was
cause both 2 and 3 was taken
oh yeah that was around the same time that dragonite had his previous name
i think there was 4
also known as sneaky
so when the switches happened i thought it was just one person evolving but noooooo
no you haven’t
memory leaks, man
that's not quite an identity crisis
i can remember ida, kay, dratiniiii, blade lord nay
oh how could i forget, i’m counting viking sis and sis as two as well
lmao
mordred
also i think it's time for me to sleep now
i wanna explore the exterior of your house first
hey drago
are we talking streaming or what
otherwise it would be 4
super mario 3d land, crystal, and platinum
and pokemon when she is
ah yeah true
but crystal is one of her fave games
gummy why do you insist on making things awkward
he might just end up using dovahzul translations of each user's name
i'm kinda-sorta forced to use a normal font because one of the first people to pledge had an accented letter in their name and most of my joke fonts don't have accented letters
not for me
also blitz
i can't get through the episode
mitch you do that
but seriously
anything can be a valid cutie mark
give me moeny
they got a kid to bully franklin
i deleted the dimenticare account because apparently someone broke into it and i didn't feel like changing the password
fucking bullying franklin's friends
i found this at random just now
now this is getting interesting
franklin sure
ohhh
i see
as far as i know, me, bringy, rainy, bunni, nightshade and maybe mitch have more of it than you, drago, master, flubs, etc.
mixed everything up and you have sis figuring out youtube better than you
so i was like “eh, next”
nvm switch battery dead
sis started vlogging and showed me and i realized she was even better than me at it
im stuck at the now loading screen
thats bad right?
i'm in a dungeon
wow you were right
it was fast quest
sounds like a good exp grinding area
press initiate
city state levels have been unlocked sis
idk what that is
but it's your first group content basically
guildhest are now available
i also now have better pants
level 12
okay thanks
i learnt resurrection
granted mario 3d land is not a complex game by any means, it's just a suggestion
okay franklin is being a dick again....and no i did not afk to just watch franklin
slugs attacked me....but then the fucking jackal came over
then i kill that jackal
for revenge
i must have missed that one
i was about to say who wouldn't help poor cute gummy belle
i'm still amazed you haven't been hit on yet lol
probably
i can play  more since i will finally have 60 fps
i told you i can get addicted to another game
2018
omg new soup
before it became a cash cow lol
i should be playing phantom hourglass on it
that’s basically copying me
i'm gonna go with roy
4th?
thank god
lemmy
my little sister and i got two scratch tickets each
now none of us won anything big
luck it is
soooo luck?
no duh it's a fake lol
how am i supposed to know
because why would scott join a pony server
new design!!
nice
has anyone looked at r/worldpolitics in the past week?
sheep are just big bunnies
people
sheep!!
honestly i am tempted to do this
franklin is making me mad again
oh yeah
sounds hospitable
better tell your cousin that his time and flower money is probably best devoted to other things
he’s like drago but less nerdy and more social
you can get a 7 day free trial
as long as you have internet
you buy them and they are yours for good
i can see why he has that name lol
where is the cat
i only see a teeth monster
playstation and xbox live charged money for online from day 1, and it's not because they hate their customers the problem isn't that you ahve to pay, the problem is that nintendo's isn't super good
i want to carry switch around and play super mario bros 3 or world
now time to troll drago
but if i need internet
yeah thats pretty dumb
i shall be on pc permanently
and apparently they figure out on their own really fast
though i would need some dress
i mean league name
it just shows you what emerald and topaz carbuncles can do
yeah
free teleport?
athernet
limsa is the only one of those you've been to
i need to talk to talk to someone in limsa
lmao
i have a far quest now
also i should be accepting the new armour right? not the bronze piece?
afking for lunch
basically, the drydocks has the final section of that story arc.
strange, i recall it being no more than 2 consecutive terms
eh, just let me know if you do
the calamity did a lot of things
and after
the 7th umbral calamity
very fantasy like...i like it
basically, the flow of magic in the land was disrupted by bahamut, and has yet to recover, if it's ever going to
let me check the map
charlie go zzz zzz zzz nom
in coerthas?
so im doing sidequest
but yay im getting better
i think i'm like 11 or something
i been addicted lately
plus while my oc is model after me, there are slight and many differences. gummy belle is literally me
drago, those defence games are like league, how about you play a better game
yall want to hear something dumb though
i don't have a problem you have a problem
which makes it even weirder that the switch doesn't
as long as you are sub then you can play them
also im level 13
im editting a research video for english but im adding memes and im having way too much fun
i think it's alette maybe
it's more the "subscription = games" part that bothers me than the "you don't get to keep them" part
well i already have online since the games i play require online
you need to share the memes with us first
but my guest wasn’t bringina
aren’t the servers shut down as well?
probably
the only other thing would be visiting you for like a few days but idk if you can put up with my insanity nor would i be able to add that on my trip next year
which means my pokemon 3ds collection is complete
work is done
is like $600
don’t like zelda but mario one is too expensive and i don’t need that much storage
the character on the box has nothing to do with the card gums lol
it was like the best of deals
demon lord
so they tried to drop it onto eorzea
you proved me wrong
inb4 gummy plays pokemon drunk
i heard
hence why i use open back headphones so i can hear my surroundings
earbuds suck
today is over
i haven’t even touched it since i last used it
not for me
as well as massive variety with weapons
okay back
oh yeah journey's end update drops this weekend
i'm planning on playing that with eyan's group
he committed the biggest crime possible: he tried to get people to pay attention and vote
terraria seems to have more weapos than minecraft
that being said both can be stressful at times
or hunting for rare fish
also golden tools break btw
my fucking golden ore
plus you can carry around a workshop thing
then you don’t need to even go to the store
yeah i didn't expect that
granted i think he said the only reason was because everything was all ready
inb4 he does
though i am curious
ohhh
like old days
i think most people would be just fine with that
true lol
i had a lot of fun with ultra sun though
those games are way more fun
and i would do it again
the problem was the events during ultra sun that happeend
yeah
unless bringina feels sick
i wouldn't want that
whos dumb idea was it to buy this?
i mean this is your first time capturing something that's not ds
and i have a hard time figuring it out because im lazy
oh right
but the second it works
and im lazy
i get that it's pink but you are clearly drinking a ton
gummy loves pranks
gummy: ask china
also aren't you a shareholder of this server?
why as me?
you also tech run this server as well
the nintendo store or the annihilation
gummy puts so much pressure on drago
he watches baseball alot so he prob wouldn't pass up the chance of going to a game
okay i ordered some wings
chicken and waffles
maybe going to citi field isn't a bad idea my stomach would enjoy it
i'd prob blow all my cash on food before i even get to the nintendo store
all he would have to do is throw you in the nintendo store you will never find your way out
you could buy a solid 2 games with that
what's this about accelerationism?
gums would do the same to me
drago
i want a verbal thank you
a solid 6 bucks
"that guy whose name i forget how to say"
no it would be something more ridiculous like saying it a different way every time
though i can't tell if you're trolling me right now lol
you got that from google
true, you were still in that small town
also demon lord
i remember
the international super ponying fried chicken fund
you are what you eat , pretty salty
i just finished highschool, i am done
yay congrats blitz
which i'd feel less bad about
want some wings blitzypoo?
are only exclusive
now i will be salty again
it's a big day for you
now they do have the other versions here, but different form which i don't want
now i need a blitzwing toy
whyy
sorry gum no can do
i can't
but but
nooo
it taught me wrong okay
which knowing you is unlikely lol
was like one setting
here is the test stream
wish somebody from the ndp could be a pm
morning sis
wait is that real
you're welcome i guess
tv capture cards are much easier to work with than ds i'd imagine
i might stream soon
all right
doing some online work atm but i'll be there as soon as i can
fucking useless switch
it's charging now
wonder how you fixed it lol
i got expensive ice cream to cheer me up
yeah it's back now i can go back to watching jj mccullough
also what you guys think?
thats mitch
mitch was kicked out of the pony club
mitch stop being so awesome
mitch doesn't want to be a pony
game maker marketing: "make games without knowing any code!"
game maker users:
i think thats spiritis
might actually take awhile now that i think about it
it’s not perfect
the fuck
wait kireina is here
and yes i am at walmart for err reasons
i dont even know how i got here, but here i am <:f_thinkderp:408369856736657438>
drago pay attention
guys i pulled stupid again
i also want a milkshake
i sped by accident in 30 km zone
so the start of the game got really boring
platinum is way faster than diamond and pearl though
i honestly thought i would get annoyed by it
because we have 16 rugs
mom doesnt want the wooden floors vacuumed, it doesnt get everything
that's a lot of rugs my guy
aww,  kugal does he slip a lot on the floors?
thank goodness i took the chance
yea he slips and they scare him because when his nails clack on them they make spoopy sounds
i didn't think you went anywhere but walmart
it’s as good an elgato
no software needed even
then i bought a $20 headset and a yeti and they both work way better
my second was a logitech g one for $70
the server's sargatanas/aether btw
good thing i know for y'all
ever since i got my astro, i learnt that i had to get open back headphones
cactuar is also on aether
my little sister used to do youtube
right after beating wall of flesh on the old world
computer or internet issue?
not internet since we're on the same one
i have seen super stupid
call me stupid
why was strict in the server in the first place
you guys still haven’t banned him?
he actually hasn't been around much until three hours ago
camelot sort of changes
wait
cause streaming better
i just want to be able to work out a falloff model dammit
new drago icon
i forgot
then again
last time i commented
that surprises no one
i did single player a little while ago and it was working fine
or play a better game *points at league*
ffxiv
depends when i can go to my dad's again internet is way better there
wow the wii u eshop seems to look tons better over the switch you could even apparently get animal crossing wild world on it lol
i didnt expect it to out-sell both smash and botw but welp
nintendo can boast the same game has sold the most on the last 2 consoles lol
this is not clickbait from what i can tell
damn ity
he's very vague and it's mostly a lot of he-said she-said
that was with zero support googling for an answer
i'm also visibly lagging on my brothers' screens
it's also weird in that the enemies seem to be in both the place where i see them and where my brothers see them
and i hit it with a melee weapon and it took damage
despite technically being way out of range
but im talking about his servers
in usa democrat but thats because no other choice
i know the ndp doesn't usually do that great and hasn't finished in 2nd since 2011 but hopefully they do well in 2023
i too support the acceleration of heat in the atmosphere
i know demon lord was having issues as well yesterday, could they be related?
i would try but im lazy opening the game
see gummy that's why you're supposed to disable the everyone thing
depends on whatever the equation you need to solve to mine the coin is
finally stopped being lazy and naired my legs
your name is duck

thundercracker
also i just saw this
well that canadian va is
ian j. helm
17 minutes ago
skarmory...
skarm...
skyrim...
there we go. that makes up for yesterday.
it's not as comfy as it sounds
i prefer a real bed personally
chugga: i'm a horrible for not remembering the name of the one who gave me this house and scarf 
also chugga: let's not help our friend pursue her dream of being a rescue team
i only watched his super paper mario walkthrough many years ago
cartoon network
ah i was hearing cartoon network and got some confuzzled
neon strike
it underwent a number of changes until i dropped the glaceon part
by that time i was big on vi, and was excited for gen 7 of pokemon
so i used neon strike litten
it was so cute and graceful
it becoming the bulky incineroar
felt like a personal betrayal
actually sis, moon is a great game
i think maybe i felt bad about her never be able to play a gen 7 game
the ultra games are better though
it's still too fucking goddamn slow
you don’t notice it
then again you kicked my ass last time
eh, i've quit pokemon so it likely won't happen
stupidly long animations
also bringy threaten me on stream last friday
poochyena
idk so many things i wanna do
sadly true
but i want to
im still surprised no one has made fun of my streaming yet
because the papers took 2 months to come back to canada
or july 2
i don't recall learning that detail in us history
us history is even garbage at teaching us history
significant portions of the us just do not give a shit about the rest of the world and prefer pretending it doesn't exist
i always wanted to make history vids but i cannot animated
how to mod on discord
i could probably do that
plus i knew the mechanics of pokemon way before lol
iceland history is interesting
serpent riders?
honestly i wish i can teach the class history of my youtube, cause i lost my chance in grade 10 when my teacher asked me to
my favorite part of us history was none of it because by the third time we talked about the american revolution i was sick of it
if it's a question then the answer is no
oh here it’s still an issue
i realize it looks like something else
everyone here calls him a terrorist or something
i emailed twitcg
if somebody told trump that he would lose it
stay inside
my mom called me
and told me to order food
she clearly is encouraging my bad eating habits
oh reminds me of something
remember the time i was addicted to jake paul vids?
political channel
mitchhh
why are you continuing the converssation here
no...not like that
also gummyland
there we go raid is gone
then again it’s not public
one of my mods actually admit while it was rough at first
you're all welcome
get out!
welp i was gonna get tinnitus anyway
~~im biased towards xy~~
drago
but this is so relevant from what i wanted to do
no..
i don't even know who this deji dude is lol
sis im telling my friend all about my final fantasy adventures
that's thaumaturge, not arcanist
i posted two boss themes actually
i need this in my life
i want a hint of blonde
so demon lord
i wasn't the only one tho
when you said you quit pokemon
dx is a good remake
re-releasing ds games without any changes would be hard
they changed a few things with that
it’s a remake
is luigi’s mansion
<:ponkeww:541034938204422195>
i’ll make fun of your pc
though i recommend the msi one more
demon lord, you mean you are gonna buy a desktop or laptop?
i already paid for the msi one, i just gotta pick it up
cause that would...no that should make your ffxiv experience better
and demon lord.. *dies on inside*
or play games with good graphics
i mean there's a lot of overlap between games and streaming, and streaming and editing
but cpu has a lot of cores and threads
i know some streamers use two computers to stream
i want something like that
it’s the green pc
80% of the quality for 20% of the work
or in this case money
get an amd cpu and save...about $150+ or buy a intel cpu and spend an extra hundred or two for a tiny bit better performance
though i want a good gpu for one main reason
i might use that when i stream games that heavily need cpu
did you see popeyes delivery vid?
you must seen the new one
i’ll get them to give you free apple watch
my pleasure my pleasure
you should get popeyes delivery
still aren't gonna have any of my cash
turns out you're not missing much
as in she wants to stab a former classmate and bomb me with threats last night all because i called her a fool
get her to stop
though the most creative one was that if she ever sees me while she is driving
for some reason
i love being addressed as ms. gummy
every so often someone will call me "mr spam" and i'll start giggling like a six-year-old
idk ms. gumsicle
he's annoying me too
i made another ff character
which puts me at
she is also level 80 like you
gummy just saying
"don't piss off users" is a valid rule that people break all the time
if you want a easy ball-on-a-tee reason to get rid of these people, just add "don't incessantly ping people" to the rule about spam
i mean lol
as a joke yes she is
but she doesn’t like how he isn’t joking
and he’s like dead serious
gummy what did you do now
but since starlight glimmer is a show character, others will name their accounts the same thing so it’s hard to know who is who sometimes
i would be lucky
so all i had to do was take off my pants
he's stalking us
drago hasn’t been around gummyland for years
new staff
same old gummy
which is like, every other day
drago drama rarely happens there though
try getting raided almost daily
it’s tiring
pony servers get targeted so much because either they like making fun of people or think we are horse fuckers or something
i do
if people repeatedly don't "break the rules" on the books but are constantly getting in fights then maybe there's something wrong with the rules on the books
if they do it again, then it’s silencing them
usually a warning stops most people from acting stupid
people do sometimes make mistakes
also i used to be very anal about checking my unreads but i'm in way too many servers
woo i still have it in me to be amusing
christmas in may, all right then
it's a gummy's mind
do you need to question his mind?
also one of my mods is like fuck it
the guy decided to ping mitch in manechat where she has no authority
tbh solid decision
someone's intentionally going around the rules
usually i would say no..but this one for sure has to be yes
though i will deal with it after
but now i have a new problem, a new person joined and they are likely ban evading, apparently they used n word in past...problem is their account is a deleted account now so i can't straight up accuse them
this means i can literally show you all my walmart adventures in video form now
it does
i just tested it
you already sold it to math
how much money is going into betting gummy fails
work sucks
we are returning to my youtube career
it's less that they recently got in trouble and more that they're in more trouble than usual
i need sub bots to get me 10 million subs
and i shall do a walkthrough of latest pokemon game
lots of info
$1000 dollars a month? haha sure i can do that
fine mitch
vlogs
someone hit on me
sort of
okay what happen was this other hot girl came up to me
she had eyepatch
good for you
bleh
gummy belle's hair isn't all blone
but better qualities
and you don't like her
it's probably cause i don't care for final fantasy
revalatia is less about the fancy stuff
thats one different thing
but i was like
but then i realize
there was a glow coming out of my boob, come on game
why am i chosen?
fuck crystal thing
aliens
the fuck
raubahn
omfg
i leave to a new area dramatically with everyone saying goodbye
when i been gone for only 10 fucking minutes!!
i can't wait till sis wakes up so i can tell her all about it
sneaky?
yeah
what did u expect
and isn't the angry type like deci
that was the second thing i expected lmao
and when sneaky did influence some things on my streams
i blame drago
oh no radiant and bitl live in arizona hope it didn't happen near them
ive been using vegas for three years and only just now found the setting that fixes the "program freezes momentarily when you click out of the window" issue
3+3=72
first time was 2018 september?!
yeah
how about you show up to my crystal streamv
does anyone know of any keyboard that exists that costs as close to $0.00 as possible
doesnt matter if the keyboard is shitty
damn microcenter has one for 9.99
oh shit, neato
they're pretty good for finding some prehistoric tech :^ )
helps that they enjoy actually doing their job generally
maybe about a week ago?
keyboard?
my current one is $223
you get a pass then panda
> they're pretty good for finding some prehistoric tech :^ )
we just threw out a bunch of 80's computers from the department of chemistry at work. i'll get a photo
lemme see that good shit
my cs professor has a pdp-11/34
and not quite, grease was leaking out of one of them
all that stuff
<:lulw:583892297893281812>
whelp
and rip all the data
along with the spectrum and bbc and othe rthings
which means i will buy 7
yeah give the pizza to me instead
fine wine
fine wine indeed. it's delicious
so u haven't discovered it yet
though i do wanna get through more final fantasy
and rage
you haven't seen anything yet when it comes to sad cutscenes
8 days
so i can't complain that much
oh nice so we get the art book while the uk gets the ost and an art book
okay fine steam i'll play some new games
it's never too hot for skyrim
it has to be, right? the wii was like five-year-old circuitry by the time it came out
but because i have passion and commit to it
thats my mood
my mood is decent, im just evil
chaitic
chaotic evil
serious me
oh yeah before i forget
gums has snapped
fuck this shit
i thought u hated poutine
i heard poutine
i call it that because poutine is in their name
oh what the fuck
i want poutine
anyone wanna come over?
if one event happens
wanna know what those are?
i once wanted to drink rubbing alcohol
might hang in vc tonight
gummmmmy
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
those are now ***mine***
i'm taking those fries they mine now
my fries
soundwave superior autobots inferior
i'm attempting to force terraria to work with some buddies - it seems i can't play this game without connection issues to servers xd
shouldn't this be in the voice channels category?
i have no idea what youre talking about
animal crossing is a happy, family-friendly game that can be enjoyed by all
who was the one who was always complaining about everything
"i like pie" "i hate pie and you should feel bad for liking pie"
guys cut the banned-youtube guy some slack
gummy stop being lewd
"she only tried to strangle me once" gummy 2020
who wants to explain the laws of thermodynamics to gummy
joke's on him
good times
gummy most people do
i cant play minecraft
if you give me a time machine i'll play minecraft
y'all gae <a:atpc_ppboopyou:480771868639625217>
yes do
i would've but roommates decided to have friends over and my pc is in the living room
there, i have a spare
no stream today demon lord
all good
on that's cdn
so i had to go get my pizza
im the taller sibling finally!!
wait what?
the different kind of *love*
welp, it be the like like
philia tends to be that way
like pedophilia
weirdest way i've hurt myself: a swing hit me in the mouth
huh interesting
sort of
how do u heccin do that
but the weirdest way i've hurt myself was on a tire swing
and i kinda bent backwards and ended up under the swing
that is terrible
what level are you?
google dot com > how to put someone else's message in the trash
interesting
now you are speaking my language
remember
why not just use one of those
i finally did a few weeks ago but barely
probably not...
i wanna play minecraft
gummy you fool
mitch im mad
a trans girl on twitch committe
this woman is nuts
wanna see?
pretty stupid of her to call gamers that when she is literally on a platform for gamers
he passed away a couple hours ago, 11 years old
im going through another midlife/gummy crisis
wake up early and get paid little
i think i still have a scar
mitch why you abuse dog
what's weird is i can remember how it felt being bit
if we were siblings and were the same age who would be the funniest
well yes, but it's not a high bar
im not that irresponsible
there seems to be so many leaks involving nintendo as of late
it could just be somebody taking advantage of low security since most of the people running it are prob home
apparently the data was stolen a while ago and theyre just releasing it now
dang it i was hoping i'd fool one of you lol
the cactus toilet has the tooltip: 'how desperate are you?'.
very desperate
and gummy belle is as cute as revalatia
so i want revalatia
wait gummy belle is me besides some things
so don’t touch me
so mitch
and watch blood splatter over everywhere
nothing
also
who actually wants to watch me do my walmart trips in future
so you all can watch me drive around in circles
they would be interesting ngl
on the outside no
i legit have horrible anger management
whats the plan tonight mitch?
i should make food and stream
one of my twitch rules is this
my head was like “mate you can barely read anything”
hell no
yeah i can't see it getting better
whatd twitch do now
oh right this was mentioned before
good job twitch (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
that's no excuse
wanna give me money for youtube?
jake paul like vlogs
broken hero sword combined with toilet
didn't seem like she was going to
says the guy who hasn't had less than two other "michael"s in any of his classes since about second grade
sis tells me she sees a lot of gummy
this game is my life, basically
okay streaming is done
so i had to drive a bit far
alright
maybe 7 are staring at me
im mad
how come
i feel like i need to power trip a bit
we learnt bringy has some strong opinions on gen 8
and newer gens as well
which is fine
you may remember me talking about a 24 hour nintendo music stream on youtube i used to watch
tb and floral apparently dated again..,even though the last time it ended up with abuse claims from both side
i why
im sitting back and watching this
isnt floral like
tb is 20+
so yeahhhh
need you
very important for me
seriously why are they dating again
gummy
i hate you
now imma watch this to help get rid of what i googled
oh bukkake i just googled that
and eqg
i am your clone
not even close
there are none
there cannot be another like him
and mitch before you ask, there are also high requirements to be sibling like with me as well lol
or my mod requirements
yeah
i was never serious about it besides sis tbh
well i was serious with it with regal
guys
lets do it
that's not gen 3
i went treeko for walkthough
my sandshrew
maybe
there's a few ways to met people in ff but i feel like they might be a bit difficult for a new player, especially on the free trial
ah, i see
i wanted to wait for you
what i really want to do though
mornin
....evening
and his name had rarity and mlp in it
started talking to him during and after the game
he also is a huge raven fan
idk how
but i ended up saying “hold on a sec sis”
a brainfart, i see
so that messed me up a bit
yeah, good point, and im gonna do that to my new friend
screams
if that was true ida and i would be vegetative right now
well you can die if you don't enough sleep i believe
they know a lot of cartoons i like
back then
of course
though he does have heavy depression
so does half the planet
and gums sometimes
sort of
that's fair, i know i'm being a bit harsher than i have been in the past
but your patience has finally run out?
i think i'm just sick of him using that as a reason to not be there
i mean
it was 18/19 yeah
and that other guy
and hmmm two older women
that and i have no life
im evil
gummy's youtube channel is so dense that it collapsed into a singularity
interfering with the flow of time around it
hahah
gummy you should get one of these
guys
someone who i think was ubereats or skip the dishes came in my workplace
i wanna float down a river on that lapras float
guys
im probably not going to get to play it until june though, becuase of shipping times
really?
i can't handle xenoblade so gummy definitely can't
definitely not
and yet it'd be entertaining to see the attempt
nope
tonight
okay!
and not chewing
chewing is overrated nightshade
sis, just because you are my older sister does not mean you can...do whatever you just posted
and no im not up, im just errr a ghost
i just found that quote funny
that is so me
they are great
i agree it doesn't make sense
i wanna see a skateboarding chobobo
okami doggo
doggomaterasu
aaaawwwww
guys
for my last 3ds game
mitch hold my orange juice
oh actually thats really out of date
love them
huh well then
they were... okay
hey gummy i made $25 selling one of the things i made a few days ago
im technically a professional now
think i am gonna have a huge staff shuffle in gummyland
think imma make night shade a mod
she's errr oh no i forgot
hmmm
once sadtrooper does her oc
he uh
but think sadtrooper forgot
"how much longer than expected?" "just a little bit"
name his favourite song
if the world was ending
fuck no
not even on top 10
what
even nightshade knows me better lol
woo!
and i'm on discord everyday
you need to assist me in my evilness
i havemac and cheese cooking
gib me
time to go convince metacritic to up their score
you take gummy
just like someone else here xd
protect the gums
don't be silly mitch, he mysteriously disappeared and nobody found a body
im still here
no regrets
well you should
is it kraft
no, it's the walmart brand
grissom air force jets flew over my house
nope, i'm staying indoors
so about 25 c
oof, 74 at night
time to play ffxiv before work
side note, scott the woz has hit 1m subs
scott the woz?
honestly he deserves it, he never has sponsors in any of his videos so he comes across as very genuine
scott deserves is solely based on the fact that he is somehow able to put out quality surprisingly consistently.
demon lord
that's awesome that he can handle both
<a:hypersclap:650821992563343402>
it's becoming more clear every day he's got nothing to use against biden
that's where we are now
i've seen he may pick warren , klobuchar or harris
interesting
good job friend's mom
she is very sweet and one of my best friends
this is terrible
okay so against my better judgement i looked at trump's actual twitter account just now and uh
but still
he's like
windows shell is indeed terrible
do i want to
i just saw something on uberfacts
that scared me
"couple stumble across spider eating a whole possum"
god damn it
i've seen them all but don't remember what happened in them tbh
i must tell my new friend about my youtube career
am i though?
or am i trollingv
maybe im a vlogger now?
what else is new
the potato wedges look okay at lest
you call those fries?
bleh
the greatest thing ever
best
mitchhh
more than a saint drago
a god
i meant
here is another channel you should check out
idk i sorta figured people like shigery miyamoto and john carmack would be the gods
i don't recall
eyan's mystery dungeon
so i have a question about the mystery dungeon explores of time , darkness and sky games and it's prob a very stupid one
how about you watch that walkthrough?
or do i have to make one for you to watch?
get friggin roasted child
<:glims:452873060585046028>
i been raging for hours now
i hate walkthroughs now
but tbh
i still enjoy a little of what i have left
so amazingly profound
i wish i could go back to 2016
what no
that would have been good make fun of you material
so lillie thumbnails
~~skitty thumbnails~~
go beat someone else
i censor a lot
gummy you are b*d at v*deo gam*s
friggin ma thinks gates to infinity isn't good
drago that kills me
i have like four more tb in drawers and in the basement that are also mostly full
idk but i have a question myself do you know what the first mystery game was that allowed you to pick whatever starter you want regardless of who u had selected on the personality quiz
ma and i were discussing it and we landed on the conclusion that it was gti
what sis said
nice pants
do i get them both though?
seeing both those games for 60 bucks makes me wanna vomit lol
white one
mine is silver and broken ish
$125 spent...
if the world is ending is playing
nice sweats
old dses and ds lites have gba readers
i remember following along eyan’s walkthrough of super mario bros 3
that was from the guy who made the original ds and 3ds capture cards
~~hey demon lord, get ready for a fire red and leaf green walkthrough~~
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
....alright?
i need help
idk, you are good at problem solving
(that was a response to your disliking your appearance and the gummy belle thing)
the axe can probably help with that too
oh, i have a strong dislike of my appearance and very camera shy
i'd say there's no way he's getting away with that, except he probably will because he's gotten away with crapping all over all of the other amendments too
you probably know me the best out of everyone present
i opened it!
in this black 2 walkthrough
i will my channel!
if i had one
this account has been terminated for violating google's terms of service.
thanks for sharing
thancred?
i get the idea ida's pretty familiar with ffxiv
both cause it's thancred and because i know he's involved with the part you're in in the story
also i look smashing
but it wouldn't be cheap
i already planned on streaming pokemon yellow
if i do find emerald though....
btw gummy remember to grab the side quest while you're in vesper bay
oh that's pretty good
me want so bad
(healing one is white again)
i want that more
this mutamix
idabolical ida
im heading to dungeon
so this is why i quit in the first place....
this is your fault for not talking me out of it
eh i don't feel like selling my gb player
i would be using a capture card anyways
besides we both know you would give up right away
gameboy advance cartridge battery?
i did it
i wanted the box as well
and this isn't a malaysia like box
and the back also has that
don't get me wrong
which
like generation of mystery dungeon
i don't own red and blue but have dx
good idea
i meant stream btw
they're now much moreso fans of the graph manual structure that is wikimedia
but i think i taped my ds to wall one time
but ash never noticed
guys i opened up minecraft for the first time since 2017
and the rest of us would like, go up to their elbows
mitch are you tall or not tall
but soon my bf will be the gianter giant
is charlie a tall charlie, or a short charlie
charlie is a pretty big charlie
took me two hours
i keep getting error msg
yeah it's exactly like that
now jail him
rona charged me twice
so i was gonna stream today but bringina went mia??
hnnnnng
thursday..
im already burning out
yes sus
sorry been busy lately, but once that is over, i will do more ffxiv
since i love the mid boss theme
you know imma do the opposite of what you just said right?
oh i needed you for something
that still confuses me to this day
don't worry, a few more days and i should be done the filming part
tbh i don't remember
oh that would have been summer 2017
i think i remember that
its mostly because making highlights of each stream is monotonous, easy, and redundant
i highlighted them right away after im done
and macaroni and cheese
lots have join gummyland recently
mostly trolls and lurkers
don't know when cause i have work
so lets hope mystery dungeon explorers of sky doesn't do that
for me i don't blow cause that damages them
and super mario 64 ds
huh. it makes sense, i've just never thought about it
i bought games with it
lots of games
yup plus luigi's mansion
plus art
gummy you know i die inside every time i hear you spent money right?
i was upset yesterday about money as well
but turns out, it wasn't the case
especially compared to the $500 dropped for the games and art 😛
oo nightshade, describe me
that's about what you're gonna get out of me gummy lmao
well i'm back, what's the emergency?
it’s been announced
on this day
man what are the odds
i knew it was coming
damn
now it might be good
or it might be bad
wait different then i had no control over youtube banning me
and bella getting mad at me
that is me when you told all my friends on skype i was bullying you all because i said “no i don’t wanna play league”
still
if its an ssd it will break. if it's a hard drive, it will have the electronics which read the disk broken or deformed
it’s not doing so hot
bullshit
the rifle is way more fun
yeah but then you have to brace against the f = ma from an explosion going off in your hand
so no one can go into it
grab a flash drive with some linux distro on it, sudo apt-get scrub, scrub the old drive
i wonder if there's a windows equivalent for scrub
can i drown it in water?
breaking point?
oh gosh
this is the worst idea i ever had
actually i don't think i did
how you know what i was talking about?
this is bullshit dude
i will be screaming at the video in vc if anyone wants to hear me angry
i swear that cnn reporter has guts to try and interview that rioter
45 episodes of that? ooh boy
so i gotta fix it
oops
now i know why i quit youtube
i looked like i was crying
i've never seen them so bewildered and confused
lillie
2020: the craziest movie plot that happens to be reality
but nah im retiring again soon for good
inb4 gummy gets the urge to make videos on a gen 4 remake
yeah i would tbh
you told me you had $1000
it is
"bird type pokemon"
noooo
kugal pet doggo for me
you only get up to ep 40 something
then you either pay me more to watch
or well oh well
then im going back to retiring
if by entire you mean watching literally every episode that's a no
im pretty sure you didnt watch the whole thing start to finish because it would have made something interesting happen in the analytics, but random parts and stuff
finally
im slapping it on for mitch to see
then deleting the channel
aaaaaaa
i need to post video of jagger
i should learn a nuzleaf voice to trigger gums
get out
dedededeledele wooooooop
jagger go nom
that doesn't sound like piplup
im buying chrono trigger
nice
on the phone
you don’t deserve it
wow gummy
it was cream sosa
and they were cream colored
lemme show you
at least
my co worker
cashier work > youtube
mitch mitchum
gummy belle
i have no words to describe how i feel about the name mitch mitchum lol
i was just scrolling through bulbapedia and was like who the hay is this
gum thinks in english instead of gummyish talk
sis customers at work are pissing me off so much
i know sis
you're the only person on my switch friends list with animal crossing with fewer than 100 hours
although i think that says more about animal crossing than about you
but i still wanna give you a hard time so
sucking all my time
i find animal crossing more fun when i stream it
playing alone, when i make a funny comment, no one can hear it
eh same with my walking around walmart and touching everything
i touch stuff okay
gummy is angry more at 11
it's 11, where is the "more"
both of those statements hurt lol
what no
you're supposed to be mad at me
technically i've never played xenoblade, so i don't know if i like it
hey remember the time i ordered a cpu and it arrived in my town two days ahead of schedule, and then went on a sightseeing tour all around new jersey before finally showing up in the mail four days later than it was supposed to
lolwhat
guess what
im also drunk again
poor gummy
im a streamer
its the last thing i wanted for history records
2. to see if i can keep up and enjoy what i did back then
basically
it was to show mitch how it was back then
you did now
hi drago
drago is here now pls throw snowballs at gummy
it's almost june
well now i have
if she wakes up on time
she took a nap
im not as young as i used to be
i need to sleep earlier
i am a kid
i go to walmart to buy toys
i like that
is it safe to call you a quitter
i'm looking at yoshi shirts cause why not
the fuck
it's not very pleasant
it may be lost....
im gonna fucking kill you
so mom's a physical therapist
help
wanna trade moms
i remembered the time in a book i read
it was grade 5
think a baby got blown up in a book i read in grade 7
the fuckkk
<:skarmthink:692790214531350608>
guys
and im thinking
if you are asking friends that you obviously haven't had any lol
im losing to a blogger on youtube
i never thought i would see the day
the screen protector
you can get the game on switch and stream it from that
also you slept for like 40 minutes
gummy do u even math
june first?
oh boy
oh yea that but also pony life
im always up around this time
....yes sis... *mutters*
2:44 am
also, happy pride month y'all \o/
happy pride month to you kugal 🙂
not doing rainbow avatar this year
(っ◕‿◕)っ
instead i'll just destroy the heteros' pride some other way
uuuh
idk im kinda lazy
🏳️‍🌈
i mean i'm hetero but i have no pride so...
fun fact
i might not be hetero
what do you call it?
asexual?
you've mentioned this i think
demi?
pan?
pan means you ~~like pans~~ like pretty much any gender including other genders that aren't the particular two
bi means there's something you like about boys, and there's something you like about girls, but it's not the same something
pan people don't give a shit
im demisexual sis
wait
i guess so???
yeah but im only attracted to the person because personality
so long
i can guarantee chocolate is bad for them though.
discworld
you could start with the colour of magic
they really made a league book
i'd question the plant quality
i think canada day and 4th of july is cancelled too
one day we'll all be telling stories about 2020 lol
well demon lord, one good thing came out of me doing project: gums has snapped
more streaming ideas
do you see?
say whaaat
and sunday
i thought it had something to do with the lusty argonian maid
are you trying to overwhelm yourself
go ahead i guess xd
apparently he made this church trip because he was embarased that people knew he was rushed to a bunker
> almost
sword and shield dlc
pay extra to get the missing parts of the game
it's pretty much just extra content the dlc isn't necessarily needed to enjoy gen 8
doesn't matter what version of the game you have you will be able to get both versions of the dlc when they come out
sounds dumb
it's amazing people are still freaking out over pokemon dlc when zelda got it nobody batted an eye
likely going to be unobtainable unless you either get the dlc or trade with someone who did
all those legendaries
you can literally make legendary team of 6 xd
doing that would defeat the poitn, wouldnt it?
i think what she means is do u need the dlc to actually obtain those pokemon
it seems like a paywall, honestly
what's home?
transferring from gen 7 and go
~~inb4 she loses her mind~~
bank has been a pay service since [checks notes] x and y
i mean bringina and me both shared our distaste of new gen of pokemon in platinum stream
not for her though
streamin it is fine, i just didnt enjoy playing it. tho honestly its been so long that perhaps instead platinum i played diamond or pearl and those are worse games
i believe those ranks gummy since you said gen 4 is your fav and you mentioned in your video you wish for a gen 4 remake despite trolling me about u not wanting one lol
how dare lillie not be in the thumbnail for part 2 *unsubscribes*
tbh you can flip 5 and 1 around
i dont watch the anime so i'm just going to make my rankings the opposite of what gummy's are
never mind then id have to rank jake paul
with games id go 3-2-4-5-1 and i havent played six onwards so i cant really rank it
anime it all sucks
bee movie > any pokemon anime gen
gums we gotta show drago gen 6
you have triggered me
it's easy just say high-level oop languages are overrated and manual memory management is what all the cool kids are doing
loop piplup and mudbray together
perfection
fuck...
im supposed to obey her but i rebel
hey gummy i like torchic
looks what at what is playing
idk what that is
i don't have a current one
what is this?!
im good at time management
weight of the world is in ffxiv
dunno if a remix can be considered classic
oras version is better
mitchh
holy shit that was fast
that disscworld?
ace attorney and 999 also have a lot of text
tbh it's a bit like picking the low hanging fruit
or itd better be like, half of the entire cow
all i know is
.......
i literally said this beef makes that dish
does the upper right one say "go away" underneath the cat
probably
gummy you should learn to game dev
plus hating your life at the same time
the worst of both worlds
all the good people in the country need to get behind biden now
i'll admit, i do feel better about his chances after this
pretty sure it was bernie
even fucking alabama?
some of us change our minds, but some of us don't :/
i feel somewhat sympathetic because i used to be that way.
which is very very ironic
in case you ever beat yourself up about it from time to time, don't, you're a dope person and we all learn and grow, just be proud of yourself
thank you, means more then you know. my upbringing was full of a lot of bigotry and i never really realized it until just a few years ago
nice job
also this one guy reminds me of blitz
his music is dope
or maybe she does but you dont
what?!
get out!
i'll exile you back to zeal server!
good luck
thats an opening
look at this
i never said it wasn't good in fact when you showed it to me originally i loved it
im enjoying every minute of it
don't think i have done that for years now lol
it was a zeal thing
you have broken me blitzypoo
i love it when gummy screams nooo in all caps
thats it
why do i hear boss music
i believe it
~~should be 3~~
mitch why you up?
melatonin hasn't kicked in
drugs again?
why did i choose sylveon as my fave?
yeah weezing is way better
now that is better
hi panda
starting to see a sign
gotta say, you're quite committed to this
nor do sidebox
true
and yes this is killing me slowly
don't forget im trying to aim for 3-5 hours of streaming a week
how the hell do i do this all?
i wasn't joking btew
tbh the usa and canada really shouldn't be rivals with each other just because they are in the same continent
you could be right on the canada interesting thing
my local best buy thought my little sister was a native canadian that came to steal
i think to stop all this native canadian crap a pm needs to get something passed
doesn't the uk have quite the racism history too
i don't know what i think all i'm thinking is racism exists and it's a sad reality
shush mitch
no thats not
didn't expect it to come so qick
i ordered clothing for a bomb ass dress outfit and they should come soon
boyfriend is gonna com up hopefully in mid june and we plan to have our own little personal prom night and dance and shit
if you are around
you're gonna do a 24 hr ffxiv stream
but not oras
idk if i want to go that route
but i would go the catch 386 pokemon route
honestly that's not a bad idea, that game looked pretty fun
one of the better rom hacks out there from the looks of it
whether that be the official emerald or oras
that was a bit overkill
well...
eyan never even got that far in emerald, and he put hours into that game
never touch battle frontier in emerald or plat
it is 50 minutes long holy shit lmao
what i have in this box contains the future of streams, ffxiv, league, and any other pc games
it is time
aaaaaa
gummy be like: you guys are nerds
and there goes dragonite for the foreseeable future
everyone screams about drago xenoblade
gpu is some sciency shit
mitch and demon lord, good news, if i keep a good pace with filming...i calculate that i should be finished with filming by next week
and im still faster than mitch
i tried to make a meme so i went to google "two scientists experimenting photo" but accidentally googled "two guys experimenting photo" and now i regret life
clearly eyan doesn't care enough to show up, so i have no reason to stick around anymore
but you make a good point lol
are you sure you aren’t crazy when gums makes a good point
not that that has anything to do with zeal
he look
you known i wanted a good gpu for the longest time
every time i install something, something breaks
sooo im holding off
also killing my stream and ffxiv time
this is wayyy easier than i remembered
that
never again
its gummy to you
you know
btw mitch
if the world was ending
im not drunk anymore
but but weren’t you part of his youtube team
i knew because it plays all the time on the radio for you
that never was launched
we will find you a league streamer
i know who
it looks so boring to me
where did you stream this on?
youtube
good point
i literally said
were you not listening?!
youre weird
im not
roasted
also demon lord it’s not what you think, even though it looks like i slapped your name on without cool effects it’s well
okay i slapped it on
told you i didn't want to commit
can't argue with that
i mean it's his call if he doesn't want a community anymore, but he can't expect a ton of people to stick around if that's the case
well those guys still engage with their fans regularly through streaming and stuff
true
and seth well he does whatever tbh
the mods and admins do stuff there
but it's not like it's new demon lord
oh yes
this again
im making fun over you over gen 7
i have all 4
end of an era
just a month or so until my dsi xl's 10 year
flat doggo
pffft
in terms of filming
stop splitting accounts drago
pls no more
more super market music/
okay
why did this become a meme?
of course im first
logan though has done supportive things though
has he actually gotten his act together?
and many actually agreed with him
gummy help i don't understand
view bots
the audience retention is like 20% of what it normally is too
yes the public and analytics counters disagree
more clacky sound
but i could be wrong
i was gonna pledge myself
but then when i did get the money
he stopped using it pretty immediately
wait no
sounds normal
though pls pledge to gummyland
wonder what happened to my patreon account tbh
sis is the only one that can like keep the server and gums under control
anyways
it’s not walmart
it felt so _wrong_
cotton candy dipped ice cream
this just happened today in canada
<:ponkyeesh:644274573197443112>
yeah canada is definitely not innocent either
it just looks sad and bad
but it does look sad
hopefully the us blowing its stack will motivate people to stand up for injustices in other countries, as well
prime ministers do something about native racism
reason why i followed was because this person has like 100 viewers but less than 1000 followers and she seems to have my style in terms of streaming
no webcam and brb screen is simple
what the fuck
yet it still happens
minnesota is liberal and george floyd happened
still racism!!
i get that , racism exists everywhere there needs to be some movement for all these natives who are killed
he cannot
i've never seen a president have this bad of a double standard with peaceful protests
the riots need to be put down
oh boy
cotton candy?
nyt seems to get backlash all the time
i mostly like the new york times because they piss off our tangerine in chief but also like
ontario, the liberal provin
i'll admit, i expected more from my province
just for province
it goes to show how the conservatives are in shambles
trudeau racist as well
i've only seen the one pic that blew up
and stuff like that
it does for me
if trudeau is forced to resign following the 2023 race i'm not sure where the liberals will go from there trudeau in my lifetime has been the most famous prime minister
...except u tap it few times in fe when its in correct position, but u know what i mean
i'm b
that is never planned
the gummy roasting game
oh god
and a partridge in a pear treeeee
true
my only other guess would have been mystery dungeon
not the style or anything
40 episodes, good god
so it will still likely reach 40 though
i quit after 47 not 4
no it didn
so it all worked out
they never work
honestly not gunna lie demon lord
in terms of editing
i stopped recording
i should make a meme though hmmm
just remember guys
the more i think about it
the more i will likely decline
ff has never looked as pretty
until i get my new gpu installed
my new gpu should get my in 100s
i capped it at 60
and it’s still at 60 i assume?
which means it very capable to reach maybe 100 if you uncap it
also im being advised heavily by queen milotic to be careful over this job opportunity
they can be risky
im a bit jumpy today
no clue sis, some just prefer 144 fps
144fps is generally for fps games
also while you are here
good job kugal
over video
good job
ph master
that ssd don’t keep storage for very long?
though a simple yes or no was what i was looking for lol
this is what i have
thats an ssd
wdym?
i'm gonna be taking circuit analysis next semester so this rabbit hole might just have some tangential connections to what i'll see then
that's news to me
even twitter people asked that
i can't even tell what logo that is lol
olive garden only won one state and it was new jersey
i looked everywhere i still have no idea what place dominates indiana
actually there may be more than that, those are just the ones i know about
is what your looking for
its basically just a sub shop
i just looked up what it isad
i think your eyes are just worse than mine because i can read it just fine <a:5_hmm:585845634830172176>
well i do only have one functioning eye
i am raging on wii sports resort return challenge
hey guys i'm traveling right now but i wanted to pop in and say hi!
be safe
stay hydrated
get off your phone
as in sleeping
okay phew
not literally crashing d:
mace him
can i have some cash nightshade?
whyyyy
i thought you were just gonna punch them
looks extra intimidating
even better
im dead
will spray paint still run?
doesnt hurt to find out
either it does nothing
nahhh
no sane person would want to steal a car with flowers on it
maybe add a huge pink mustache with eye lashes on the car
eye lashes on the head lights
oh god
hmmm
how do i make a car gummy proof
just have the car playing this song 24/7
i refuse to go near it
or do both
<a:hypershake:393624358066847754>
i love tiny house things!!!!
yes mam
i saw one that had a dual loft system with a bedroom and movie space that was really neat
i probably wouldnt do it unless i had to, because i like things that like set in place unless its like one of those beds coming out of the walls
see i dislike the transforming veds
my bed is the one piece of furniture that is a hardcore, "must be set at all tines"
yeah thats fair idk how i'd actually feel about it unless i was there, but i dont see myself minding at all
i think tables would be the best transforming pieces for what i want
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
i want the lead up to how we got there <:gwmrodialul:400750684670263310>
because it didn't give me sale price
and somehow it pop up something
i see, so really was just gummy things
im... kind if impressed
that make sense
i mean i dont expect one
i just hope for one
it didn't give me sale price
2 for fucking $4
it charged me $2.59 each
thats bad
stop
nice
gummy i don't think eating it is going to help
this was the logo of my high school's robotics team
wd-40
i'm homeschooled what is that
a kind of lubricant to make things move
dude
lmao
that was far less interesting then i thought it was
i don't have any heckin'
the only reason i know that is because i typed "can you use wd40 on bicycle chains" once and google's reply was ***no no no no no no no no no***
followed by an explanation of what it's made of
let me see if i can find it
hate the living area in this one thiugh
i'd build it myself if it was way cheaper to do so
i was going to say "we should all move into one of those things so we could share resources and have a carbon footprint of effectively zero"
idk what a carbon footprint is
but this is my dream home
`skee ball` >:(
wait really
a medieval gothic castle
you think i was talking about ur little hut
gummy you can do that anywhere
nightshade, i will pay you $200 an hour to clean that
hmm. maybe
kugal you're sharing that right
is it your birthday? <a:pog360:690310205367779350>
yes yes yes i promise
happy birthday 🙂
<:6849_pepeold:534781151525470228> wait till you get to my age
texture cache issues by the look of it
no too much tf2
it's like a pyro spy checking
the cycle is complete
quite the event
logan may be an idiot but i guess he does have common sense
how come?
mordred, jean de arc, arthur
joan/jeam
think jeanne d'arc is french spelling
charlie is deathly afraid of my egg shaker
what is an egg shaker?
so it's like a maraca
i got it with my drums
ooh!
fun fact: i changed my profile picture for a quick joke and then *lost the dan folder*
oh no
actually no idea where it went
flubs flubs flubssss
who?
i missed you
that's what they want you to think
what the crpa it's me
hmmm...
you missed a lot of things flubs
i was well aware you werent unstupiding
hey man 2/3 of civilization hasnt been wiped out, amirite
i always knew you'd be an upside down watch kinda guy
is it normal to have very bad pain in your hernia when doing jumping jacks as you breath in
it was for gummyland music bot
also yeah i remember you posting these
i think thats something most of us would say
i wouldnt wanna go to spain because traveling sounds stressful and i dont know how to adult and i rather stay home and dance in my office chair listening to moosics
wonder if sis would wanna go watch bullfighting at bull festival with me
but kugal just think of it like discovering some new galaxy or some math shit <a:blobcry:393645793925529601>
idiot liberals
today im at a liquor stroe
gums is gonna get drunk
it’s brand new
does it actually taste like cotton candy?
if you've got any questions about the story you can let me know
cause if i get arrested for this....
nothing much sis
i got all the pieces to my suit so my prom outfit is fuckin ready
and a bajillion dps
i was actually really worried tbh
why tf would you be arrested for collecting cerb
because there is a tiny possible chance mitch
if i make over $1000
but trudeau wants to jail us
but trudeau announce today he wouldn't for an honest mistake
anyways, yeah, that first primal is fairly easy
i would need sis support on second?
charge n discharge is such a lovely combination
oh you could link them
nope
and resurrection doesn't work if you get killed by falling off the arena
no, doom is a very old video game
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
why thank you
lmao
idk what that means nor can i pronounce it
<:wat:579563576914870333>
well....
just one...
4 tackles in a row
rng was not on your side
gummy is paul confirm
btw gummy, i've decided on giving you a present once you reach a specific point in ff
to be fair
took me 30 minutes to find a fucking eevee
"she just him in the head with a bible"
it might function as your bday present
but in that case it'd probably be pretty late
it doesn’t matter to me
tbh don’t really care if you give me anything, being a sis to me is more than enough for me
which is good
then he memes jewish people..
oh flubs
it’s ffxiv isn’t it?
remind me to get a do it emote
.....you have a good point
im parked
you dont roll when parked
if it's a good price, then get it, but i'd say you shouldn't play it until after the first 3 games
see gums, two ppl in separate servers tellin u same thing
less than 5 months till election day, let's hope the country can survive that long
im starting to get convinced bringy and my sis are the same
we just have good taste in games
defintiely not good taste
tho sadly i havent finished it. a shame, its really good game
tis fun puzzly game. and ur ded!
a game where you play as a ghost
and theres cute dog present
i stabbed you?
fuck yeah!
nope
shall i pick up that ace game?
if you intend to play ace attorney one day, then it's nice to have
cause you and bringy have interested me a little
this aint ur kinda game i fear
bringina i can read!
also i bump into an aggressive salesman
sister: is playng xenoblade
sister: oh look, you can see the big thing in the sky [shows me the switch]
me: thats sharla's butt
sister: no the other big thing
today i learnt why you don’t drive and drive the hard way
raspberry lemonade
she still an asshole?
flubs since you are back
i can make subway jokes again
the weird part is the order of operations
let's plays and walkthroughs are different reeeee
yeah ones a semi-viable business model, the others a walkthrough
idk man, i still respect it. ss meant a lot to me too, i wouldn't even mind putting together a video like this myself. if he had joined the discord earlier he would have had a much better video.
pls do
wait till im done channel 13 first
i thought news was on channel 5
get 'im skarm
i low key kinda want to actually do this gummy video
its gonna be like a 2 minute video
that's a long outro
but but sneaky...
i have so many ideas i don't even know if i can sleep tonight
when in doubt, russian roulette
go to sleep
june 19
and sis it’s not what you think
oh no that means im turning 5 too lol
or my age depending on mood and situation
i wanna play it
can i just prove him guilty and be done with it?
it'd save you a lot of trouble in the long run but he's also the main character's useless friend
i gotta actually use my brain for this don’t i?
im probably gonna kill it arounf
i'm convinced that gummy is just making up numbers for how many channels he's wrecked now
all deleted
next two were deleted
then i came back several times but didn't even publicly launch the channel with 5,6, and 7 before something happen and deleted
wait think 7 was banned by flubs
6 was the drunk deleted one
thats pony stuff
tbh im now curious for "what happened to supergummying?"
do "what happened to 2andahalfstooges?" next pls
ahhh fuck
and 8 hours will be sleep?
yesterday i film all night
so im almost done what i wanted to film
hmmm...about literally 1 hour to figure this out and test to see if discord audio works with my switch capture card
oops nevermind it doesnt *look* scrolled down, i was actually just a little scrolled down
does this mean mr flubs will be back for the streams?
im sacrificing stream time this month though for stupid shit i told you about
with you making weekly appearances
flubs wanna be on stream?
okay....
imma have to kill yall
noooo
didn't install it yet though
so im putting that on hold
im watching the thing
i never grew up with those games
pikmin ripoff xd
oh god what is this
plants vs zombies
2k21 now with 200% more sweat
i actually missed what the title of that game is lol but i'm gonna have night terrors
this is literally 3d kartana zero
dude...
arkane game. stealth assassination gameplay
do you think bug snacks 2 will be called "back in snacktion"
i havent either but it looks exactly like the kind of game that i need to
the trick is to just reuse old triangles so you dont have to render new ones
it was either going to be price or hardware reveal
idk there's gonna be 2 nines
thats all i know
truth
unless they wanna push them both up 100
idk i think like a good 75% of these games looked good
i like the one that looks like a pixar movie
i forget what it was called
that one was weird
the pikmin one
no the one with the kid
yeah probably
i'm still seeing rumors of a port of pikmin 3
kena is the one i'm here for
there's no announced nintendo direct right?
not yet as of right now
actually i kind of assume all publishers will do that not just nintendo
but they're supposed to announce the next smash fighter this month
they should do one this month though being june
im tired
alright demon lord
my insanity paid off
good luck
i realized what motivated me to keep doing it
i'm like 1/3 of the way through my script for the gummy vid
i can’t sleep
im considering calling in sick at work even though im just tired
fuck it
idk how you feel like this a lot sis without needing caffeine
i just want sleep
nightshade!!
level up
hello sir what would you like to order from popeyes
you are doing this wrong blitzypoo
remember the vids
i am not mean
can you please tell me the name of the guy in your profile pic
beautiful thank you
hes obviously making a video on dan
your video
i'm covering all the gummy lore xd
you also aren't gonna ask bringy?
now i think i know who gummy is, dragonite, superheronerd, and jello
i never met chuck cuddles or skull kit
stay safe and happy jello
jello, animal man is making a vid about me
finished my bachelor degree about a month back
lol sounds good
alive
somehow
so far so good
same as gummy
awesome
> ff xiv tbh
the convergence of written english language to pure abbreviations is underway
you'd be surprised lmao
i don't play lol
jello you like anime games right
i recently finished cold steel 3, yeah
waiting for the pc release of cold steel 4
have you a switch or switch-like device
but i know like no one here
to the point where i am now able to watch entire streams without subtitles and still understand a majority
i mean you're still young, but yeah i wouldn't attempt something like that again
im notn young anymore
i don't feel different
i'm less than a month away from turning 27
i'm very ancient
some of that was out of my control though
unless drago notices anything different, pretty sure i remained the same
im not sure what doubled down is
why the fuck
sis, i literally can't breathe in it
and i feel safe cause my city has no cases at this point
i mostly stay at home
i also do not wear a mask at work
am i the hooded reaper guy or is that someone else?
no argo is the blond lady in short-shorts
e!xkcd
e!xkcd now
omg fuckin lincoln
but hey
that's just a theory
a gaaaay theory
fuck
i ended up eating some of my hair
i heard somewhere that the average human eats around 6 hairs a day
my hair must taste like head and shoulders then
would conditioner change the taste>
mines minty 🙂
well i've finally decided on the game i want to make a youtube series on eventually
oooooo
youtube?!
ptsd
you should go to sleep early then gummy
see unlike you gummy i actually want to do this for fun and not to torture myself xd
gonna make dinner and fall asleep soon and wake up for work
anything that involves youtube isn’t considered fun
is it the hunger games
to fight to the death
kugal
you're way off lol
minecraft dungeons
it’s fucking pokemon with fancy sidebars isn’t it?
radiant historia
wreck it ralph
donkey kong 64's donkey kong arcade
wait
is it a let’s play or walkthrough?
i'm not really classifying it one way or the other
that's the mini game from ff7 right?
what system?
it's kinda like a game in a game
but it’s not that
sigma emerald?
pokemon will somehow squeeze into there
such as
ibuki mioda
oh yes i see, emo girls
emo girls are great
me and death don’t go well if it’s a normal person dying instead of bad guy
the god in ffxiv controlled those people
but sadly
what the chicken
forgot to mention
one of the other tribuni of the xivth legion
and the legatus rules over them
i assume i will bump into them eventually?
did you do the level 20 quest?
also, what level are you?
you told me to wait till im back in limsa
not exactly
iirc the next entire section is in gridania
so you can do the arcanist quest now
i would say only like
pugilist and rogue
but you could also just switch between them at will
what’s a summoner and whats a scholar?...
yeah
when am i getting that again?
well, you're less than halfway through base arr
grind as in through story
tho when patch 5.3 hits, they'll make both parts of arr shorter
i never read league patch notes
probably at some point in july
when am i done arr?
what level i mean
heavensward is a bit of a different story so there's a bit of patch content to go through to connect them
plus, if you know how to recruit random people to help, it's not that bad
yeah...im bad at social interaction
i'll show you the trick when you get to that point
thanks
i realized something today
bad romance
i just like the song
not the person
i hope you've learned a valuable lesson
lets do it again
just keep it up for like a week or so
do you want to wait till all 30 vids are up?
i will have half up by sunday
yessir
besides well sis, drago and a few otehrs
lmao
because don't
okay
im still curious
good (:
well i know for a fact you wouldn't make something offensive
since you know i would ban you cause i have a short temper
oh no
i started my channel on feb 13 2013 in terms of supergummying
im trying to find a movie where a boy gets stabbed
i'm actually not sure if i've seen this one before
normally he at least sounds like he's pretending to be making jokes, in this one he's just explaining the state of the world
n-nothing
it's called pay it forward
which part?
sis this going to bed early was great
