welp she left
good job
trying to get ida to cone
what does that mean skarm?
bad drago
also i just realized my server is interesting
the sun never sets on it
i dont think she knows what a drago is though she just calls me bad boy and shakes her finger at me
my favorite is telling her to eat her veggies if she wants to grow up big and strong
lets get it

oh ok good
we talked about zeal server
sounds like a real hoot
you missed dank memes by chuck
wow gummy there's drama in your server and i didnt even get to start it
zeal might have some problems but uh
some of your people are not cut from the finest wood
tb is very depressed
no quotes in that file!
did i forget to save the autoreconnect thing
dragonite 1, dragonite 0
insubordination
ashbot is proto-skarm
since ash belongs to camelot
what?
three weeks ago i planned out my entire youtube channel schedule through 2024
why?
im not giving you money
ok now im just disappointed
fuck everythiing
he invokes his right to remain silent
also
im pretty sure i have logs somewhere though
what do you even want
im pretty sure i only saved general anyway
so that might be good
this is my hiding place
don't let me down <:bingc:508016918809280532>
hello!
you prob know most people here

welcome to the brand new camelot
everyone should listen to that ^
*shrugs* lol
there
rolls for everybody
it's drago's ghost
communism hmmm
to each according to their need, from each according to their ability
you rang
master told me he ban him
well you also got to ban pogi
he left though
thats what it says
hang on
for god's sake
right i forgot to check that box
wow..
you already are a math boy though
can i be the math girl
how many roles can you attach to a user before discord starts to complain
i know ive seen people with like twenty before
ask my friend artiks
i dont feel like making any more
okay master strangely msg me calling me a communist
like just calling you a communist or was there some preamble to it
i replied with this
you know sometimes i think about where it all went wrong gummy
nah my true allegiances are
what's up ^w^
been okay
no drago
doing good on my way home from class lol ^w^
youre almost as bad as me!
unless youre in grad school
are you in grad school
all the random roles lol
what about them
nothing lol
aw you removed it
not really lol
tempted to change all of the roles that say "role" to "roll" but i think that joke wont be very funny for much longer
welcome
lol why is that even a roll
i dont even have a real friggin role
oh sweet
the north burnt atlanta to the ground
(guess we are making politics legal here)
gummy, you and demonlord's opinion on the history behind wwii really helped
oh yeah
now for hitler...that‚Äôs a man that was evil
now for canadian history
thats what i think why he wasnt
now that is an issue
guess im teaching him
huh, interesting
im surprised you find *that* topic boring
there has only been 3 wars fought on canadian soil
this is after 1867
i mean only 38 canadians died
oh wow
that was boring, as mean as it sounds
to learn about anyway, the great depression wasnt actually goo *great*
now germany in 30s was interesting
it was funnt
i'm either 12.5% or 6.25% german
well thats what my mom says so
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
im viking/irish
i ran around my living room with war music and this gun
pretending you are in civil war
of all the states why ohio
dont hate ohio
fuck ohio
that's because we're a failure
if rc were to be here, how much of a chance would he make you his rival?
i didnt say he was most annoying he's just annoying
draco is an ass
according to drago
i just did
pimaster
okay that leaves rainy
of course if they did that, theyd probably leave in about a half hour
drago you just gave me a good idea but yeah..
have you ever seen deci in a place where he couldnt just swing the banhammer? he hates it
hey i can too
you have mods quitting on a daily basis
like the supermarket runs out of juice or something
you haven‚Äôt seen the majority
by definition the people who do the most talking are the majority
i know
i thought he might be mature
that feedback is what i like
helps me improve the server
hee hee butt
okay hmm
i wanna see if anyone else feels the same way
no thanks
oh wait
im not gonna represent myself as weird
camelot 1.0 got stale as well, it was you and me bickering back and forth everyday
still that got stale
we hated each other
now we love each other
she would say the same thing
im asking her
not my sis!
kugal = truebelievers + a lot more happiness
tb and me butt heads a lot apparently although i havent interacted with him enough to know if he's memeing or serious
hey not everyone there sucks
i see people talk about this artiks person a lot but i have no idea who that is
i looked at chat and saw yanis and meant to say exilon
exilon can be annoying
somehow he isn‚Äôt ban yet
and a troll but a good person
everyone is cool now...
sounds like a plan dragon man
so basically
you do the thing but backwards
whats that
except starlight
you mean he's in a perpetual state of internal turmoil?
he likes me but also wants to crush my head
this is the server theme
make way for my sis!
gummy you have too many sisters
and regal and ida
maybe every time someone says an arbitrary word like "epidermis" we could pretend to get all offended
i built that server from the ground up
camelot had chuck buuilt
im going to buy a bulldozer company
i just took over
hmmmmm
i sent him my video now that i finally posted it and he didnt say a word about the fails
actually that's because it was mostly cutscene and not much fail
lame
get him to star in it
im going to get you to star in it and spend the entire thing roasting you
last time you didn't even wanna collab with me
aint that a pocket monster
wait no its that dude
i made fun of him when he said he wanted youtube as a job
i had more subs then him at one point
not you btw regal
i meant ida doesn't like flubs
yet she likes gummy
i want ham and cheese
ash meet flubs and regal
i create nothing
this is a true friends server
there are givers and takers but i am neither
drago
who else?
he felt bad?
well you're not missing much
just a quiet league stream
im gonna be honest i dont like league lol
yeah
after not being on my old computer set up for like 4 days now, it feels like an eternity
having no computer is one of the worst things for me lol
yeah that sucks, hope you can recover them
kingcorphish is in eyan's chat
interesting
he's one of gummy's old friends
ah gotcha
not like i care
oh no justification needed dear will
i think you can give it to yourself mang
do you want me to do it? lol
ok, what role do you want
uuuh
thanks
hows that?
perfect
thanks

e!wolfram what is the answer to this question
incorrect
i bought sis a plane ticket to switzerland
come on man show some respect
a guy name ‚Äújewishdickhorse‚Äù join
it was horsedick, get it right
no quotes in that file!
see you should have changed it to something more descriptive like "i have no friends so i try to attract attention by being inappropriate for no reason"
i will sis
i did drago
if he doesn‚Äôt and talks agaib
i will ban him
im giving him a chance
gummy what have we learned about people who only join servers to screw around
i'll give you a hint: there was one whose name ended with eff and started with a j
that sis and drago hates
i think ida said he's chilled out a bit since two years ago
although to be honest i am not feeling a great burning desire to have him in my life again
there should be a public execution option for bans
okay
and drago let my staff handle him
oh yeah also turn off the psu
nah leave it in
i did
open it up
the one below the graphics card
now open the product?
yeah put that in the slot. use some force but dont break it
indeed theyre quite pretty
once i remove it
id just pretend it doesnt exist tbh
maybe to help screw it in
1*low profile pcie bracket (for smaller pcs)
if the other metal thing doesnt fit i guess
do i unscrew the big one off?
done
yeah
maybe
night
the commission is done
and no i will never show it because of reasons
walmartica
spiffing(?)
discord deleted their account?
some zeal guy finally after like two years
but then their parents took their pic like it was like some wedding
that sounds dreadful in every sense of thw word
are you sure you aren't him?
wow i fixed my monitor so it dont wobble anymore. it was very irritating to fix but i did it woo
just make all the days the same way
i dont know how to write cabbage scottish
keb-edge
ive got a friend named scottishgeeks on twitter, i should probably ask him if he's seen the pok√©ymon thing yet
they eat sea cucumber in east asia
blitz is a close friend
sis would be jan 5th 2017
but we really didn‚Äôt talk till 5
some day my hug will end up squeezing her to death
thats wack
demon lord yours is harder to pin point
anthony was like march 2015 officially
animal man was like march 2017?
january 2017? i started watching in like january 2011 lmao
dragos a nerd. using the internet in 2011. hah.
still don't care for twitch tbh
all i remember was he told me not to date
jello
now jello
my "x and y" video that was a reupload has 3 comments
what problemsv
also flubs doesn't believe in the moon so his opinion doesn't count
you said you turned it off
so it wouldn‚Äôt say stuff from here in zeal
the service there is crap
welp there they go
good good
not really just set a base date and then send xkcd.com/(date.today-basedate) or something on a 24 hour timer
happy œÄ day peeps
sis im dying
rip nooo
there's probably a `url.does404?` method somewhere though
what happened to the money comment?
on your channel
i'm telling aqua you said xenoblade is confusing
93 plus two supplemental
im being like harassed in university
just give them your money they'll go away
turn the tables on them
oh...yeah that could do as well
i thought you were gonna say, bring me to your uni so i can axe them
or we bring ida and she can chew them for harassing me in a scottish accent
hey i can't do an angry sis well
is that the part where i come in and stuff you into a locker
drago
i might actually fail
too tired to do anything besides playing dnd
well im kinda screwed since i been slacking for months
flubs
i old new york is coming back
because old new york is just york
nobody cares about york
what meeting?
and i swear to you, if my sister made the same decisions i did they wouldnt bat a fucking eye
would there be like legal consequences or something you
flubs
idk ask someone who pays attention
the fact that theyre apparently less qualified to do this than you amuses me
also i mean no matter what i say, at the end of the day theyll accept the fact that my granddad said they shouldnt makes it final
no u
i only take 0.5x fire though
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
eh i guess not
and wayer
so much water
how the fuck do i load this thing?
bullets go in the scope
fuck this
"bite the powder, ram minie ball in, put on cap"
before we aim
this needs to be played in the background
there now where is drago?
you forgot the part where you put your boxers on your head and sing the alphabet song
alright new plan
rude
~~ill show you a ram rod~~
the fact that youre not playing skyrim for one
finally i get to do what i always dream of
fuckin france
oh tb?
should i like
message him
and tell him that he's not going to get the help he needs by waltzing in and introducing himself by saying "i'm lonely"
no got a babysitter for him
believe it or not i know more crazy
rip that random murdered dude
he was complaining over not having a gf
i hope he complains about having a gf now
someone posted a pic of a nude women with a horse dick in every channel
i got chew out by my staff after for making the server public
yeah its dragos fault
fuckin drago
lets make this server public...
wait we already have a troll here
theres like some weird love thing happening and its horrifying
but it only mods when there is huge spam
i saw it but it was weird
my server will allow non bronies but if you post a meme shooting people
yeah thats a rude thing to do
hehehe
how did you see so fast?
i like the trolls that are really witty about it or the ones that are beyond lazy as shit. the ones in the middle are the shitty ones
some are so bad
just not sure if i should still allow invites for everyone or not
what do you think flubs?
gummy you havent been on thw i ternet for very long have you
i think he would be too scared
he acts all tough but he's actually a sensitive giant
nah i can train him to be tough
if you look at him the wrong way he'll et scared
oh hey hates strangers
he's so scared of them lmao
oh my
wouldn't he bark then?
nah charlie would run
she would continue barking
he would probably do nothing
lmao
thats better
eoghan says he wasnt drunk but i'm pretty sure he was
probably
i think that was the only zeal raid to ever happened
flubs!
hes the nicest person in my family
it means business if they threaten to you
by the way flubs do you want a color or something
i already have a color though
its white and its great
most normal armies are armed with, you know, actual arms
"you think my handwriting is bad? well tell that to my raptor's face."
yes youd know it was him because that sentence confused me a lot
takes a while
i had sidebox/sidebars
except the more i see of them the more bad i think they look
either way
xenoblade is weird
my face is weirder than your face
flubs is weird
mcdonalds
so 15 year old drago was like this...
did you just hit the "sort by oldest" button on my channel or something
fun fact the girl i asked out in high school is in that one for like 1/800,000th of a blurry frame
it sucks and i hate it
damn it
fat is ugly and drago
not if i have anything to say about it
there we go
you are not asking my sister out
you better not!
okay i'll drive you nuts instead
i'd probalby root for her
yeah im the best at dancin
he looks like you
hungry santa 1 year ago
at job interview
"so do you have any special skills?"
that's enough of that i think
he's probablyg oing to be like why do you still have that
because it's funny
i tried to highlight to copy and paste
but eh
my spare keyboard lights up
gotcha
although the new region looks promising compared to alola so we'll see
yeah kuudere sounds like part of me
i may be a bit tsundere
alright it's been long enough, i need a big sister
wait what's the silver crown
i only see the gold one in the members list
same
okay sis
now stare at this
it was seasoned with red seasoning salt
something must have broke
gummy you should get one of the $20 ones that my school computer labs use
is this the one that you paid like seventy dollars for
you could always burn your money
i'll make sure it finds a worthy home
hey gummy do you know any cute single yellow dragons
who?
is she a cute single yellow dragon?
that takes care of that then
skarm, prostitution's illegal
i got root beer
tell her to see a doctor
would it surprise you guys if i told you i had a waifu?
ahhh
hey sometimes tbh..i do wanna look cute
even though thats mostly a girl's thing
unless you have a dirty mind and want it to mean something
unless you have a much older sibling like i do
these days we rarely fight
gummy i'm revoking your permission to fantasize now
i mean yeah, that's what you tend to do in a good relationship
my guts hate my guts
wtf did this man do to get suspended...
i should probably think about editing stuff soon
because youtube ban has already been done by me, twitter by rc, so facebook is next
how should i know
i made the new one that has less runny ink
i should get my actual sister to join this server
flubs!!!!!!!!!
tell me all about it
well grandpa died which i dont really care about but made the rest of the family all pissy
he didnt die today, he died like 3 weeks ago i just learned about it today
well since hes dead uncle george is now the oldest male in the family so he makes all the decisions and hes a dick
and what was the decision?
there were a couple but it comes down to like 5 people arent allowed into the house anymore and are pretty much disowned
let me guess
you are one of them
yeah, but that doesnt bother me much. the house is almost all vertical, its got like 4 floors but they arent that big
you told them you don't give a shit
and they wish they had that
and i dont often defend my dad, but not liking him for being the obvious choice is just dumb. he wasnt a good guy by any stretch, but under my grandpa the company was *nothing*
they actually didnt even ask
i thought they hated you
why would they want you closer?
you make bad decisions but not stupid one
and your leadership is better
who is next in line
uncle mike, whos only like 10 months younger
thats mike 1/5
is he nice?
new york flubses only
im moving there
flubs teach me how to do a brooklyn accent
you put all of your cratridges in a hat and pull one out without looking
okay i think for once an emulator is a good idea for this
you're thinking of trying out a pok√©mon randomizer
not gonna stream or record it though
but would be fun to play
i haven't always kept up with trends
in anything really xd
most modern trends are pretty shit so that's probably for the best
i dont know where i got it
it was on one of those websites. maybe the one i got that sock thing on
flubs
gummy you know what makes me sad
oblivion
that's like 65 at best
make each episode 10 mins long
i wish
those were the days
im a zelda expert
that‚Äôs easy
wrong
the dating guy went crazy, did i tell you that?
must have stood next to the radioactive uranium sample for a little too long
why was i assign to deal with this guy again?
no master did
or jello
you assign me to handle frozen angel
who the hell is frozen angel
that guy who was depressed that join zeal server
vaguely
if hes better then its fine to leave him
but anything can trigger him back
good idea flubs
i mean i kinda help him get a girl only for the girl to go out with him for pity
too bad blocking people on discord while sharing a server is limited in utility
what did you _think_ was going to happen gummy
eh blocking him would be mean
im driving this guy to kill himself
nor do we get to talk about code anymore
okay flubs bring it on!
for dixie land!!!
we are?
global warming yes
master can i link your google doc homework thing or should i find something else
every year the dolphins gain more territory
those sexy ass dolphins are going to destroy us all
lets make the world like equestria!!!
speaking of which
there are elections coming up in canada and i do wanna vote for the communist party
well our party is weird drago
and 32 hour work week
im not sure if you understand the history of communism and why it didn't work the first dozen times
i just meme about it
and takes all the power
thats what happened with the roman republic
caesar got so much power that he became dictator
flubs i'm appointing you as sir ultra major badass marshall admiral viceroy grand duke chancellor king princess pope president prime minister c.e.o. buddha god governer shogun tzar cesar c.m.o f√ºhrer, ph. d.
guess whos a doctor now, bitches
imma go cut open someones brain and see what comes out
benny attack him
update: there was more brain inside
bronycon is gonna have some drama
it hasnt for a while
drago you coming too
...did you make skyrim?
pay me
you said you wanted a series to be long
you could make a cool intro
like errr
that type of intro you could make
show me
it was great
i think yours might be better drago
early 2010: discovered youtube, found out that losers recorded themselves playing video games and that people even watched sometimes
....okay
i'm 80% sure i was trying to delete something else and accidentally checked off some things i didn't intend because i looked up one day and half the series was gone and decided welp there's no point in keeping the rest of it around i guess
this was my enemy
then he deleted most of them
the supergummying era timeline is weird 2013-2016?? but the official official would be 2013-2019
but he was young
then i lost that
oh my
well
gummy you should go post spam in my comments it'd boost my seo probably
hmm it's two in the morning i should think about sleep
thank god you are here
well that's good then
well lets seee
and im like shit
damn
what video
not that i'm complaining, mind you
right skarm
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
play this game
animal crossing might be my fav game
but it's not skyrim
hey it was pokemon
needs more jpeg?
is that good or bad
tbh it's actually a bit sad that people in the future won't be able to walk into a game store
when i was a kid i remember going to blockbuster all the time to rent games
just low internet speed problems
what type of games sis?
any games
but my internet speed's staying where it is
welp, come to my house then
no idea
it doesnt exist
you are a game designer
except for the one over there with the mohawk
must be stuck in the spam folder
flubs
omg flubs
you upload more than eyan these days
yeah
it was better editing than me
well two of my favourite games
videos uploaded
flubs that was amazing video
according to the chinese zodiac tigers and dragons which is me get along well
that explains why you and i get along well
why do you of all people haev to be a dragon
my sis knows she is an ox though
it looks the same
i added snow
oh so he worked correctly before but silently did nothing that time
this is your doing
thatll end well
twenty dollars an hour
but since we're friends i'll only charge you $19.50
you're
no some offer it for free for one time use
wait really?
yeah there's nothing helping me tolerate it
your parents might kill you
just tell them you know someone who's even lazier
you are welcome to stay here though if it gets bad
ida i send you virtual hugs
oh you know im dead right?
it‚Äôs over people picking on him, same reason i left zeal several times
but always remember the pat pat method
you did great though
man somedays i need a break from the server
if you dont youll get burnt out and start to resent it
go ahead
but yeah a brony server is hard to run
im surprised flubs
thats what makes them special
sis i swear to god
i think you meant to delete it or something
god damn it
not the site i bought them on
loopy went off the grid and katsukity is like the only one i know selling them now
there site is gone
katsukity said something about trying to return with a new site
flubs what you think?\
it'll be an assfire for everyone else
put your money in the stocks then
man some uni students are so cute
i mean errr
no one heard me
gummy stop hitting on strangers
hey im taken so i cannot hit on anyone else
you can
not the cheap one
at the beginning of the year i wanted to up my water consumption as a resolution
how was math?
i did everything correctly besides accidently messing up the last step on one problem by not pressing a button on my ti hard enough
wanna check that gum?
just go find a tank with those dimensions and water and test it
imma say you are right
good good
so is the 2ds just like the newest version of the ds? because it looks like a normal ds
it is
drago we should have an old folks thing again
flubs wanna replace bella/someone who is no longer present?
flubs
do you know how to act like other people?
canada talk, university. i am attracted to a woman
my legs don't work
non that's mostly kugal
iceland school work work school iceland. sheep something i think. gummy is a mess and i must fix him
well making any progress is an accomplishment
and you gave up....
stupid though....thats a different story
so that is pretty stupid
no, dead people can be stupid
which frustrates some people to no end
while regal never hugs me but does tell me she loves me
gummy i don't love you
the stupidest thing i did this morning besides hot chocolate was not notice my backpack had a hole in it
isnt that a kind of pig
yeah
and im surprised no one also realized it
aint nothing manlier than taking back whats yours and preventing the capitalist dogs from taking your money
also apparently the piano is a woman's instrument
guys shouldn't be allowed to play
wait till they find out im dating a trans woman
i found out my gf lives in the same city pewdiepie lives in
so you can meet the most famous youtuber and do a collab with him
welp
flubs protect my jacket at all cost
any costs
wtf?
yeah i think i'll have to
like weed cake?
i have no fricking clue
and you didn't know?
medications can cause it to false positive too but thats pretty rare
i dont think those would
yeah there wouldnt be any difference
total war is like my all time favourite game series
sorry pokemon
in general though total war beats animal crossing by a tiny bit
pokemon is still your overall fav nintendo series
and your fave game is skyrim
nah my favorite game overall is dishonored
what's my favorite game gummy?
close but actually it would be mario galaxy
for sis it would be final fantasy or zelda
it‚Äôs warframe isn‚Äôt it?
my favorite game uh
close enough
okay i would play that tbh
how do _you_ wear your instant noodles then?
that was not a personal choice, sometimes you just get noodles on your head
you should have
shits a banger
she knows my bday
fairly sure flubs actually got it right
uhhh
what's the age limit on dream daddy
im the smartest human ever
fucking isabella is annoying
i'm not interested in the details thanks
i will destroy this town
why are you stalking me on _3ds_ of all places
time to sit down and relax with
what is it?
and they are selling transformers toys
since 20012
i lied
i wanna leave but they called me over
did you get a detention
stop me from spending $200 on a 2ds xl flubs
eh go ahead
.....
welp
but it‚Äôs worth it
that changes everything
so are most parents
this is my hero
flubs
yea you're right
well if it's a day late then it won't miss it
hey gummy
which anthony
the one who likes sylveon
his name is anthony?
there are a lot of people named anthony
my ex is in scotland right now so i been lonely
but not pizza
something about her heading on the route to eterna forest where the screen turned black while she can hear audio only and then it went black and had weird text then took her to the ds screen
yes but strange since you rarely have big glitches
caught you, you motherfucker
read the tex
i sent my sister jackson parodi's accordion metal and now i'm trying to get her to play accordion metal and she's complaiining that she doesn't have an accordion
flubs we are watching this when it comes out
i need more food
calculus ii midterm tomorrow and i dont feel an ounce of nervousness for it...good thing?
oh morrowind
_your_ homework is boring
my brother got the free morrowind game
judging by his frustration just downloading the game
not trying
so apparently there's a couple of new switch models in the works
cool
because shaymin did it?
ooo i should look at yours and ida's old post on forums
see what young drago has to say
it was mostly in the chatbox
ida is always angry at me
since it was a pretty dark time for me
and eyan for that matter
what did you do now
i was memeing and this happen
it was a joke
remember the patreon thing
though kendall has been telling me to keep doing walkthroughs and that she likes my voice
(kendall is my new new sister)
take mine
3 non blood
only if i get all your money when you die
wtf drago
be nice to toad dude
i would love to read what they said
i don't have early interactions with drago either
i still have skype logs on the old granny laptop but i dont feel like turning it on and searching for them
"marry me" - flubs
hey gummy are you free this friday?
therefore you do something
homework to me
no u
beat that
hey i sold those sharks for a total; of 45,000 bells
how rude!
only if you do my homework for me
the answer is 17
(‚ïØ¬∞–¥¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ /(.‚ñ° .\\)
wanna go drinking with me when i turn 19?
maybe i don't actually
do vikings drink?
well i prove zeal wrong
dude you have no clue what i went through
rc kept telling me it was a total lost
everyone
make way for vortex!
i'll just give you all of them
epic
im less depressed over bella, drago and i still fight, fighting with ida cease since she is now my sis and prob my fav sis out of all 4
woah that was forever ago holy shit
it's okay i havent cut my hair since 2014 still so on average you're still okay
and you do it more than eyan lol
i never look at it
wait relationships
not all relationships mean marriage lol
man you are young
was pimaster older or younger?
i think i'm the 2nd oldest here
oh ash bot is kinda here vortex
again
lets invite someone even older
now that vortex is back...shit my enemy list is empty
noooo
math can be your enemy
find an actual enemy
yes!!
was that ida
that sounds like an ida thing
thats a sis thing
have a pony instead
no thank you
wooooooooo
might as well drop this here while i'm here
maybe make it the next vine
yikes
and by a lot i mean 2 uploads lmao
will be releasing everything
also i would most likely upload on twitch rather than youtube
since i feel like copyright on twitch is a bit better
also i just prefer twitch in general
since twitch was made for streaming
if only i can stream better
stupid internet
yeah that's just bad memories tbh
also i like this new server name
drago your house is on fire
toasty
also drago
good because i'm cutting your salary mister
i will go to your twitter
and read young drago tweets
theres almost twelve thousand of them, have ufn wiwth that
your face is a meme
that's a shitty meme mate
even knowing it''s a joke i can't see any way to realize that just reading it
pay attention
you are kinda like that but with boy version
well i mean you also just like a bunch of bitches
irl really bad
vortex!!!
flubs tell him he did!
soo can't
now it qualifies as a work of art
exactly
with a friend ü§î
i am a hamster mom now
how many 3ds games do you have?
since switch
i've heard fire emblem awakening is good, that's the only game i'd like to get at this point
anything else
bad bella memories, only bought it for her tbh
i enjoyed that quite a bit
hmmm surprised you didn't say smash
new copy only $199
might find that in stores
yeah but i will be sad when 3ds is gone
do any of the 2dses use the clamshell design
the xl does
youre probably turning into a zombie
cute
well im pretty sure spots on my arm are contagious
i keep getting some crap about r slash entitled parents
if i die
sis gets my pc
ok, let's play a small game. give me a scenario where you, as a medieval rpg character, would be casting a spell. i'll bring back the results.
the fireball fizzles out in your fingers, but the dragon's face is suddenly covered in dish-shaped scars
you can
and they suddenly sprout fangs for no apparent reason
sure
sure
you stab the dragon
a lightning strikes the dragon on its head, and for a seemingly unrelated reason, all flesh on one of its forelegs suddenly vanishes, leaving just the bone
to teleport? sure
can i cast anymore?
sure
but i just wanna show this
2334 caster's spellbook giggles in the presence of other books
cast a spell on you to make you do my assignment for me
why do you even want a banner when youre trying to get banned
and make my twitter look good
but my twiiter
flubs get started
he died
take that drago
one of my fav youtubers is returning
even though he has 3 unfinished walkthroughs like eyan lol
mostly look at kay...ida because i know that will ping her and drago
didn't get pinged but saw this anyways
you. feel better
‚Äúgummy what have you been thinking of?‚Äù
actually flub you also seem proud of your past
thats your q flubs
who was that gummy
fried or roast?
at least thats where i think it was going
well the man was depressed
i mean he always seemed like a decent guy in chat
flubs
can you send me that amazing banner you made for me?
heres both
thanks
10 years maybe more going after this fish in 3 animal crossing games
and i have finally caught it
<:gasp:543497905210916876>
what did she end up picking?
somerhing dumb i forget
corphish is living with a pedophile!!!
okay he found out a few hours ago thank goodness
good job
blade lord nayru
superspamming
thats redundant kugal
thats oxymoronic
there we go
as you can see
i'll pay _you_ $50 for it then
and then ill take it back because you wont need it when youre dead!
guys wanna hear a joke
no? too bad here's the joke: my life

thanks for coming to my ted talk
besides your bday
all pranks are good as long as they arent just "haha i lied to you"
true
the best gift you can give is your presence
eh i would get you one of those cooking aprons
aprons are for nerds, cool kids dont care if they get burning hot food on them
and im going to...
think of something
hey im not addicted
i only know all the lore and have watched and read the whole thing multiple times
idk uhh i watched the first episode of the office
gummy did
many girls are hot, that like their whole thing
lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
i'm sure our number of customers today was in the quadruple digits
back hom
im hiding in her closet
only i don't read
this was what i used before i got ban
when..was this made..
i know i didn't make it
ohh kingcorphish made it
yeah i saw
i personally didn't know the dude, but the main person that exposed him is a girl i been following for many years
the hot one on my twitter likes
apparently only a few people knew but had no evidence
now evidence has been put out and corphish has been hurt i know that for sure
im not banned
yay for calling in sick
that is floaty lady
<:pikasanta:516171795196542986>
oh cool now i have two
hmmm
apparently everyone is a sociopath in the pokemon community
some kingnappy guy
he knew about one of the pedo
that's good, he strikes me as one of the better pok√©tubers
i haven't really watched his stuff but i know he gets along well with other let's players
yeah he is nice
but i _kept_ my name as "spam" for a reason
you really aren't part of the pokemon community
otherwise you would be talking to corphish
<:dragonite:561983328182599704> here drago
your emote
your community is like zeal community/skyrim
flubs would be something...
all people are food, silly
main community?
community less
the community of that guy in his pfp
dan? nah im not a big fan of his fanbase tbh. its too wholesome, id never fit in
yes its great but i would not fit in
my 3 favorite things to talk about are drugs, my impending death, and sadness
very nope
but im pretty healthy because exercise or whatever so it could be more than that. but life is inherently chaotic so i could get hit by a bus tomorrow and die
hit him!
i mean she doesn't need you to tell her to do that
back in the old days ida annoyed drago
well back in the old days it was unintentional
i see
thats mean
i need to say something to piss everyone off
idk write a paragraph about why you not vaccinating your kids is nobody elses business and end it with "if youre gonna attack my beliefs, do some research first."
it needs to be more stupid
not bad
how was that?
yes!
also tell them that people who are different than them are still people
do you know anyone from the south i want to try that it sounds exciting
i do, theyre related but are not dating
bunni
gummy tell bunni that a pirate ship was born on jesus and tell me what she says
that gets truer by the day sadly
what you upgrade to?
millions
gummy i need to stop being friends with you
i might make quiz later
how does flubs know my pizza toppings well?
got 7/10 on dragos
tbh i know nothing about mlp
i just picked random ones so
you want to pet a rabbit
i made a quiz
bunni
how are yall
who dares mention flubs
wait you actually have a gun?
i got all the math ones wrong because of course
i also got 4
see 2 is the worst score because if it was more than that it would be better than guessing on average but if it was 0 or 1 it would be comedic
flubs help me fix this
did you fuckin rip it off the slider?
it was an accident
pull it down real hard and get it aligned under it
i don‚Äôt wanna break it
what if i end up pulling it off?
and how did you get mlp and equestria girls wrong?
kill me
the night is young
this is equestria girls
im disowning you
wait let me check
what happen to hating one
damn it
samsung galaxy
ooo nice choice
anyways good night
samsung did just announce a very, very expensive phone
yeah
anyways counting everyone
i think that is the last zeal people on my list
some angry scottish guy name necro flubs
except for jeff
i'm having fun at your expense
they weren't in the original camelot though
and i do like deci
yeet
i like deci when he's not being a knob at someone
he always stuck up for me
but mostly i remember him verbally abusing his teammates in league which is the main reason i dont watch eyans league streams
errr
dude r/pcgaming is so fuckin funny
ive never seen people more angry about nonissues in my life
xeon
i take it you dont use twitter
i follow mostly game devs on twitter so theyre usually at least not stupid about it but i generally hear what the drama involves there
you or me
me because my tolerance for others is far lower than yours
id get mad at bella if she _was_ nice to gummy
tbh stormy tolerates me
s t o p
wait
okay lets compare bella and ida to a sibling way since bella did tell me i was like a brother
remember?
well he has talked about it a lot in the past
delivery flubs?
like did you say "yo bitch your friend is fuckin dead" or were you nice about telling her
hmm idk flubs
this was all over cuddles and what happen
that drama scarred everyone
no they don't have permission
whatever that is
so flubs
so far patching things up has been going super well
go for it my dude but imma warm up my "i told you so" laugh
breannaa?
idk how to spell her name
damn
twice
hey no flipping off buildings
so i chased after her
`e!re` has been axed and it's staying axed
fucking hell
time to make lillie bot work
e!kenobi
but all the emotes were star wars
you can't ban me
gummy stop hitting on fictional characters
what in the name of flubs is shazam
detective pikachu is so disappointing
flubs you liked the emoji movie youre not allowed to talk about these things anymore
any movie can
how about
no joke
i see a distinct lack of shoes on that small monkey
it is not the last one no
you ever seen dora's tits my dude
fbi we have you completely surrounded
flubs you are under arrest 
come out with your hands in the air
i'm scarred for life thanks
but pls pls tell me you know my favourite movie
this is easy
thats my second
i would not have guessed that
fucking micheal bay
flubs whats your fave movie again?
this is a good movie
oh so thats why you like drums
which i didnt include
gummy if you want i can make covers for ya
drum covers
that'll be expensive but the main expensive thing will be getting an interface
hmmm covers
call it a thermo exam
for me it isnt april yet so i cant make a joke
well gummyland has already started celebrating
you did pretty well on that kugal
i didnt make mine easy at all
i'm kind of making my questions reasonable
you gotta make a better quiz
you knew her for years
im making another quiz
basically well enough for kay to do good
id screw around with the server except im on mobile
what has zeal done?
camelot i decided to go easy
dammit got 4
did i do your quiz yet?
i think so
i see
home at a totally normal hour
whats up with it for you
my waifu with...aj!!!
is that a saying?
nice
put the bullet in the open end, press the button, it goes out the other end
police says it ain't strong evidence
are they renting the place or do they own it
because if they own it he can literally make his own door with an axe
by the dude
thats fair
wait you mean to say all youtubers arent millionaires
but man must be really scary for that to happen
when you find out someone isn't someone you thought they were
whole bunch of weirdos
i talk less irl then here
because death
so do you just stare irl?
sis would be sis irl
actually i know she prob would be more shy irl
eh, sort of
you say i complain all the time
what's forums
its ponies but also with dictators
less dictators and more the mods suck
thats what it sounds like at least idk
you mean there are peopw there who dont shitpost or meme?
i always gotten along with them
im happy mlp spoilers got super active
also there are no rules here
honestly we are all mature enough to talk about politics and not post nsfw
this one is blessed
thats fair sis
everyones a dick and we should just nuke everyone
the idea of splitting people into left and right sucks
i agree sis
the guy with the birds
i love those ones
iceland's green party won the last elections (well, sort of)
yeah sis
gummy i'll vote for you purely on the grounds of putting "and stuff" in your campaign slogan
err what else
death penalty i have different opinions on
like if it's 100% proven the person is guilty
gummy make a pun i want to sentence you to death
umm pro choice
especially in usa
iceland has the best equal rights
canada tries but there has been issues'
while yes it should be a thing
i tend to closely follow all the political news in the u.s.
don't know how i've kept my sanity
but my mom and i talk about it every day
its socialism when its helping people not starve but its capitalism when its a mutli-billion bailout to a company from the govt
a presidency is cool though because you normally take 8 year cycles hating and loving the person in charge
plus i love tradition
and the one with the most publicity wins
but the party i want
when there is no food allowed in there
no drago
gummy keep your pants on
no no keep them off
im wearing this right now
the lawn chair, you may observe, is not wearing pants
night sis
but the studios that made shriek
and then suing humanity
she really fuck a bee
she does not fuck the bee no thats just my head canon
omg i‚Äôd completely forgotten about most of them
except like 5 people
flubs
need you...for something
tbh i can't remember what i wanted you in the first place now..
sorry i took so long to respon
flubs
alright
thats true, but usa does have better stuff
most of the time
though im tempted to get you a twilight plushie
alright sis is twilight, no argument about it, loves reading, strong leadership, prob could fly, and knows magic
flubs you are...hmmm
yes sis4
flubs would be like a male version of sunset shimmer
i can't wait
blitz we need to re-enact what happen
oh gosh lol
witness shoplifting while you are there
then leave and necro walks in
yeet
im not gonna try to spell that right
see how stupid i was
same time
cause i remember bella being on both at the same time
wish you can see
everything you do is cringe, dont worry üòÑ
will wings cheer you up
demon lord and drago were just normal impressions
flubs i apologized for wanting you to burn
lets quiz you
these are perfect
eat the wings!!!
call it cooking with flubs
i think the limit comparison test is cool, nuff said
see when people see dragon runes on my back they just assume there's already something wrong with me
i tried to self promote
but errr
i don't think the name is the issue here
shit
<a:superraritysad:476194401954168832>
why does she have like 7 axes in here
i cleaned it up for her
is it possible to have sex with the eiffel tower? seems a little cumbersome
to paris!
also the i was reading messages in your server from earlier and the way tenda just shut that person down is goddamn hilarious
flubs hates france
my desire to shove the eiffel tower up my ass trumps my desire to stay away from france
who was that person?
good idea
it's the best scandinavia country
theres a lot of people who go there for tourism and trash the streets, but off of the main tourist areas its real nice
yeah its cool. the touristy stuff is still worth seeing it just gets kinda gross sometimes
people suck
is turkey a place people want to go?
do you know discord well
like make the channel private?
maybe
ooh whats to eat
i decided to get a logo for my gummy jacket
also why the fuck
hey it's funny\
alright
it took you four minutes to get that joke
....
seems like since kingnappy has fallen there is now a new king in the pokemon community
flubs you missed a raid
flubs is always watching
my server of course
im the server troll here
just meme pfp are easy to ban
he does sometimes get a little accidentally rude when talking with one of his buds thats a furry but thats because hes stupid
tiberia primea
i wanted to buy monster hunter world and had the steam funds to do so, but was too lazy to do it. it just went on sale so i saved money by being lazy
so you benefitted?
how you know?
you know climate change
deal
gummy i got a pizza coupon that says "bring this in and we'll give ya a free pizza"
wanna go out on a dat w/me
this is good
what state again?
nevada
okay that ain't far
sounds great see ya then
he likes pizza
eh he can hang out at the entrance
sounds good
i use class for reddit
someone dm me over an issue with someone else
sometimes being an owner sucks
this essay will never get done
hhhh
but but
noooo
never let me drive agaon
car looks bad tho
drove into a traffic sign
panicking is natural, your in a machine that can hurt someone or yourself, but the important thing is deep breaths
that's why i don't drive
okay unless you are a city kid
never get them to start at the city
less cars and you aren't as pressure
god i wish i was there right now, see what i can do to help
can we have a channel to post/recommend music and stuff
what do we call the channel?
btw go ahead and make anything you want on this server
i'm still on the road
deep breaths and drive slow
like now
but yes easy sis, watch the road and im sure you‚Äôll do fine
amazing
though be careful of snow and ice
eh probably a few months on highways
our highways barely had anyone
i made it
<a:justkiddingipostedpp:399726365248847873>
im just dead
probably
left is this way < right?
that was correct
my turn to teach how to drive
my sister is brushing my dog's teeth
flubs
come back when youve done like 14
no im not proud but that whole essay i wrote bs
the sun never sets in gummyland
flubs is tired of existence. he needs rest
wanna see?
i believe it's the back one
thats real nice
im always tired
your nose is on fire
how is it going
how about u
are you still going to be a history teacher?
everything is going well
gummy why is my nose on fire
because i threw hot sauce at your face
gummy can i have one for my birthday
2071.1
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
never heard of it
im good at errr
yeah you got that big ol fish recently right
aminal it took you like 5 years to breed those two animals in whatever that game was
welcome to my life üòâ
lets watch drago's videos
im rioting
alaska
i love the cold but its still not canada
you haven't truly lived until you've listened to this
hmmm
uuuuuuggggg
oh duh
oh no hell is far far worse
well "work"
he lied about being alive
i have to find the electrical power needs of chicago
and now i dont know if i want to read it more, or less
watch the viking video drago
shit wrong server
eat that drago
yes!!
ok om nom nom
what is it?
so yesterday i discovered the names of the player characters in pok√©mon sun and moon
i had thought they were just called sun and moon lol
the black hole is very cool
like at all
probably
it's cute i guess
i mean its a hole. its black. what did people expect
also i mean thats shits mad far away so even that much is wack
are you calling my mom skinny
also while we're on the subject
```[4:27 pm] dragonite: "million trillion kilo meters"
[4:27 pm] dragonite: it's fun when science people try to make numbers understandable to noobs```
wow thats like 8 zeroes
it's a sextillion meters which is hilarious in modern english
and this is ida
....so apparently karna and mordred are siblings now
the spear wielder rarity is dressed like
son of an indian sun god
okay that is cool
how did it taste
why me
just because im on social media and pretend to listen doesn‚Äôt mean i can‚Äôt get the job done
my mom had a student last year who walked out after she told her to put her phone away
drago
one of out profs gave us advice though
i know she would win
so apparently there's gonna be another trg colosseum soon
i'm thinking i should donate this year
should be fun
i need someone to pay for my flight
why my server is connected to manechat when it‚Äôs not i‚Äôll never figure out
aw shit
you taught him that trick
who even
does that one even know what sex is? because its real hard  to do it through discord
i mean if you think about it life is an std, you put the thing in the thing and then the lady has a foreign body sucking the nutrients out of her blood for 9 months
someone got paid money to do that
the fat kid
i guess?
god i hate him even more
he finds out in the middle of the episode he isn't moving but doesn't tell his friends until the end
what a fuck nugget
he takes the pokemon and was like "oh yeah guys im not moving" and giggles
then she just takes his pocket balls and runs off
-random weirdo, 2019
something like that
huh, neato
drago come here i have a surprise for you
come stand in this cctv blind spot
sooo
sure why not
and im actually good at grinding money in that game
soo mayor of bells/mayor of money
but that only ended up confusing eyan lol
or my bday
those are kind of uh
go back in time and kill your grandfather. no more birthday
people have a hard time understanding big numbers, they should just take the base-ten log of the vote total to make things easy for the noobs
cause if every vote is placed in the hat 3rd parties would have a greater chance with the hat than the current election system
but then having the vp actually do something is an intersting twist
yeah
290 nukes for france
you could destroy at least one city with that many
no...i wanna eat them not die from radiation
well you nuke the fish then wait a bit before getting them
or ancient city
define those
wait no im 20 not 2
rothenburg, germany
do you guys ever voice on here?
oh hells yeah my dude
he makes funny joke right?
honestly
what's a voice
you remind me of the scot trainer
only angrier
i believe this man is what the kids nowadays refer to as "woke"
hey im edgy but i dont call him a libtard yet
life goal: see a term officially derived from the word "edgy"
im edgy
hi edgy
if that's the case then you're both edgy
what the frig is osu
wanna see?
thats amazing
also they hate the golden knights
there is no opinion or emotion in that statement
the rise of skywalker is reportedly set one year after the last jedi.[a][5][6] it is to be the finale of the skywalker saga.[7]
and therefor the last normal movie?
actually maybe
the other jedi
we already memed the shit out of how they can repair the timeline
sounds good
i wouldve recorded if i knew i was gonna win but id been trying for a while. the trick was to not die
here sis
also witcher is like 40 gigabytes so good luck me
it relieves stomach aches
actually don't answer that
because i live here
never met a maltan.... maltese..... person from malta
ive used pepto bismol exactly once and it didnt work
my turn to teach her how to drive
or the local asylum
the phone just does it
bad phone
why is it that my favourite sibling is also the only sibling besides my real sister that is embarrassed at most of my stupid activities?
exactly
i mean what
does this mean ida would actually be true sibling if we were related?
i dunno you should ask her
because im getting adopted now
huh?
adopt me ida
thats what i meant
no i can't handle that level of responsibility
if he chews on the furniture just swat him with a magazine
holy shit
hey im almost legal to drink
2 more months
still alcohol is bad for you
yeah but i dont need to worry about my health
drinking ain‚Äôt always bad if you do it casually though unlike drugs
still not good for your liver and shit though. but yeah a glass of wine with dinner is much better than a gram of coke with dinner
oxygen radicals damage cells over time
you spiked my juice didnt you
helppp
sooo
kendall chewed me out all night for not banning a troll
sooo she is officially officially sibling material as well
ooh trolls are fun
wait what
after realizing that gummy was never going to accept me, i basically started shipping him and kugal since it's probably the next best thing
any day
kids
what you think drago? good idea?
it sucks and i hate it
idk how to even code this
soo yay no rage quit
gummy im getting bored of editing xenoblade, should i take a break and edit the thing im lets playing after that instead?>
wtf is this
its every time link says excuse me princess in the lengend of zelda the animated series
my eyes
but still, link should always remain a silent protagonist
good fuckin job go get that shit
idk if i will get hired yet
they sell sport equipment and shoes
i mean shoes could mean anything
high heels are sports shoes you ever wear those shits?
shit should be an olympic sport
well they said competitive wages
idk man im bad with money
i don‚Äôt wanna get fired though
i need money real badly right now
go to dollar store
and more candy
i worked at a grocery store who lffered competitive wages and flexible hours and it was like "yeah, competitive and flexible for them"
holy moly i finally solved this damn calc challenge problem
ah sorry its crazy math so the answer is actually sin3
maybe once or twice
thanks
i already staked a claim to his pizza
the 4 slices i have left
where are the rest?
don't waste food
lets see we got em last wednesday or thursday? i cant remember
i had a&w last night
had a foodgasm
a warm body puts mickey d's to shame
you get what you pay for
micky d's doesnt take as long either but it's also not freshly made like a&w
in and out is trash
we don't have in and out on this coast
and meet drago
never heard of them
dq, imo, is again, pretty ok
never had it
i wanna try it
how bad is it?
they put 150% more tomato sauce than what is recommended
i like extra sauce
oh my
unpopular opinion
i hate papa johns
prob not
this is where gummy looks up my school on google maps
i havent had them since like second grade
i had dominos a long time ago, hated it
had it again recently, and i think they redeemed themselves surprisingly
dominos isnt bad but not my fav
not the best but ccheap
there's a buttload of wendy's by me for some reason
cherry cook?
prob best drink for you anyways
i can also go gambling....
i happen to live in the only state where gambling is legal
besides i spend more money in walmart on transformers toys then casinos
but it's g1
i dumped another 20 gb on nier automata recording today
i thought go big or go home
probably less than 8 tb
this looks cool
nice
but how else will you keep your butt smooth
or else no mor free pizza
putting food in the microwave at 12:26 am wont wake everybody up, right
i also wanna write code but the microwave is downstairs
you did it first
blame my sis for not sharing with you
you're a pickled
i don‚Äôt like pickles
it's ok, i'll be here when you're done üòÉ
you think for a second that being called a nerd is an ego check?
in reality i love being called a nerd, i live to be called a nerd
we wouldn't have technology if it weren't for them
man studying is dumb
i‚Äôll circle c for everything then
wait
imma viking now
alright how do i sign up?
this is so sad i‚Äôm actually in tears
how about you play skyrim instead?

life is work
it is thats why i try to do as little as possible
3 hey...
three is easy, it's just floor(tau*0.5)
five, on the other hand
you should mention how awesome your dog is
but definitely started to not do the best at the end
i rounded up
im a moron

don't answer that maybe
i do on most weekdays
because tomorrow most places are close
holy shit
how i know this...well i did read the bible twice

youre the second person who ive heard describe it like that, and i have a feeling you wont be the last
its fucking bonkers
so yeah
demon lord can you ask him why god gave us catholics if he loves us so much for me
most priests are usually pretty cool people. course the other ones are...not good to be around
it was this month back in 2017 when i last texted him
my apartment to acquire food units
do it
hey cool my video converter program is hanging when it boots up now
bye bye flubs
i would but money
don't look
well now you know
i thought agaravin was a guy....
wtf is this?
that's
gawain with a rarity cross dress it is then
also fate/ gareth was a girl
oh i know gareth is a girl
i only picked those 4 because wiki says they were related to mordred
look at likes
fairly sure agravain's a half brother on mother's side
ehhhh
i have a strong dislike for fire emblem these days
oh wait that's the reason isnt it
i asked her several times to be friends again
and no reply
_some_ of us just never stopped hating you
my two fav sis are also pretty easy forgiving
a lot of user interface
the japanese version
there's an english one now
and you draw 5 cards
yeah
also new players bringing friend's level 90 servants in just sweep through the first few chapters
oh my msg didn't send, it's been sitting here all day...
pepperoni
okay i'll eat it
....so that's what the app is called?
wooo got a reply!!!
like hardcore i can't even sit still
she replies to like everyone so it shouldn't be a big deal but it still is for me
i find the fact that ida keeps getting asked about it funnier than the fact that the app actually exists
it's one of those icelandic people things i guess
i also constantly get people replying with "cool" when i tell them i'm icelandic
then i realized you two were not alike at all
rapidash would burn you
it's on fire remember
oh yeah...
i won a pokemon tournament just like, a week ago
i havent played pok√©mon since i kick gummy's exfriend's butt with a shuckle last summer
ida did you even see the shuckle battle, my strategy was to just sit there and do nothing until she got mad and did something dumb
her strategy, annoy drago until he ceeds the battle
hmm or she can use a team of sylveons
weakness policy multiscale is the most broken thing ever and it feels like cheating every time i use it
well it's fairly predictable tho
because literally every offensive dragonite set ever runs it
gummy, flubs does not marijuana
weed fuckin sucks dude. its the least happy drug in existence
not even heroin?
i havent done cocaine i think
the ones youd expect from a pasty white kid pretty much
so like
you are legal
fuck
yeah but half the fun of drinking is im not supposed to. now that i can i just feel like my mom or something
thats fine im not the biggest birthday person any more
why did you check?
oh so thats why its been so colorful lately
which is why that shit will stay muted forever
most of the new episodes we talk about are in mlp spoilers
if you right click on a server
i guess we have a more colourful personality?
i thought for sure flubs was trying to beat my record back in zeal
more than gummyland or less?
i wouldnt be surprised
flubs is going upstate to yell at his relatives because apparently im not done with this shit yet
yeah. theres literally no reason i shouldnt be included and yet they wont
i have my gummy cannon with me
if we kill them they cant allow it though
holy fuck why is the house so far north
wait who is taking you?
a friend is going to buffalo to visit family and theyre taking me. the timing is good so im using the weekend to fuck over their easter too
but if you show up now
you can't fuck it up
grab me a pizza while you are up there
so that's something lol
id rather not exercise the privilege for a while but what can you do
"fine, whatever, just go away"
that was too easter
but seriously
forgot to tell everyone here
it‚Äôs now 100% confirmed i will be at bronycon
kugal you are such a nerd
math and english and the writing i tried my best but reading and science were like 'fuck it'
i dont remember ever watching a singe episode of that show
steak for dinner üòÆ
give me some
help
blitz is a fat boy
nice lol
no hug back?
i swear to god if i have another diarrhea attack
started with milkshake
"lactose intolerant"
i don‚Äôt think i am though
you can also develop it
shitttt
kinda sucks
could be something else?
if you think i can help
what is a democracy?
dude how are you not hungry
is a big one
well i definitely wouldn't be getting that at gamestop
they don't deserve to profit from that imo
actually sure
what kind?
ask wolfram whats the answer to int (arctan )/x dx
oh drago
it has bacon on it
yeah i don't really get why he's broke either
8 or 9 year old me loved the shit out of transformer action figures
im starting a collection
it ain't worth it
im returning my toy today
returning a toy
she was jealous and intimidated by your awesome toy and didnt know how to cope
thing is
because he's a butthead
i‚Äôm gonna drink my stress away
school is eating my ass
same
i haven‚Äôt started finals yet. they‚Äôre week after next. my teachers just decided to give us a bunch of final projects
you must die a slow and uncomfortable death by dehydration
just turned in a research paper today and my teacher was like ‚Äúhere‚Äôs another paper‚Äù
gross
papers actually wanna make me stop existing
gross
after i get this done
i gotta get a job and but another transformers toy
oh yeah gotta get the stream to work
after you get this job done i can beat you up?
yeah
also finishing off the supergummying channel
thats also taking time away from me since im researching
what the crap balls
gummy that was like the day care league of roasts
i got him down to $50
but litten resist fire
every single comedian does it
okay...
but not all the time
take the one past the shelf date
i may have errr yeah
i ordered a pizza
maybe there was a mass exodus to 99
oh wow
im looking for someone
55% for one
nice
oh just found out i passed my hardest class with a 62%
big cool
and a gummy hand
better gummy hands
your hands arent *bad*, theyre just not that great
fair enough
i dont know all my times tables. im pretty bad at math
all yours flubs
their slogan makes it seem like they arent
one couldve just bought the other and they couldve ruled the continent
unless mcdonalds gets to them first
the newest and biggest one closest to me
and my favourite walmart but also the furthest one
that's where i do 90% of my grocery shopping
the hell is that?
no im looking for a special kind of soda flubs
i live next to one actually
well cross the street
so if i ever visit a place, first stop would be walmart
old people
i hate being up early
ok but why
because i like hugging you
you are a wonderful sister and you tend to lighten up my mood when im down
nice to each other? and you dare call yourselves siblings
with someone thinking if they should call 911 or not
but violence is half the fun
then talk to my other sister kendall
well it goes both ways, she got me banned from the kitchen i annoyed her every day for 15 years straight. you win some you lose some
are you calling dumban old
is nice to have internet siblings
gummy wanna be internet siblings
thats why i have 3 internet ones
im kinda scared but me too
i knew it
wait that is flubs
but maybe magfest 2021
witnesses?
that being said
am i good or what
that might not be 100% it
its exactly like youd expect, it seems kinda fancy but isnt
that's exactly what i would expect
i wanna go
but first thing i wanna do in new york...
we had a target in town but now we dont
nobody went there so they replaced it with king kullen or something and now nobody goes there instead
they replaced target with lowe's where i live
lowes is dumb
hardware stuff
i went to a lowes once
like, voluntarily
isn't that guy a poet?
dirt bike racing
such a shame since he went from that typical bully when we were young to a nice person in high school
can i spoil avengers for you?
sure why not
wait damn it
thought you were a fan
if you are a fan of avengers and have no seen endgame, don't look ^
i'm somewhere in between "can't be bothered to go" and "want to not be blindsided by the memes for the rest of the year"
i think ill duck out of this channel for now just to be safe
never seen an avengers movie in my life
loki ain't coming back
bucky got the short end of the stick though
why?
oh i was wrong, endgame isnt the end of phase 3. the next spiderman is now a part of phase 3. so black widow is probably the first of act 4
im anticipating getting fucked hard for it
how do you know it was undercook?
says here pork should not be eaten pink
we didnt eat a bite
food poisoning here i come
eh if i do then whatever
wait there was another person i know with food poisoning
that is no fun
hmmm
that always fixes something
what kind of chcolate?
milk and dark
i swear im not racist
do you like white chocolate then?
hmmmm
the more you have em the more liekly you'll get sick
no...
sure
kappa
or yea what he said
ok im done being a pain in the ass
huh neato
i had to make a 1950s magazine about life in the 50s
maybe you can do it again for extra credit
but i like this better
the bear in helgen i mean
i ‚Äúhired‚Äù for free a person to make a website for my server wooo
oh shit
it was like april something 15-17
lets go blitz!!!
who else did i meet during this time?
two years ago
i actually wanted to rework that
i'll send you a version of it with fun modifications
yeah i knew that
it's 9 episodes long
i would but my mom dragged me to walmart
fricking tb got ban in 2 more mlp servers for asking people for sex
so he went to bigger mlp servers
he's the one who i complained about going "hi im depressed and everyone hates me, im going to go on a hiatus from discord" aboit twice a day in gummyland
and asked for sex there
would not be surprised if he were to go back to my server and act like a moron there
i think thats better
like if it was just your server itd be weird but its all servers so hes weird not the server
dont get me wrong, the server is still fuckin *weird* but not because of that
oh god someone get kugal the anatomically correct doll
he got ban in a fucking support group
kugal i need help graphing this cardiod function help
to each their own
my sister is in this server
what you mean to tell me is this lad got one girl, and then got a second
oh no
tb's ex who i hate has offered to make me a website
so im making a website for gummyland
well kendall likes you, and she also wants to talk to ida but at the same time jokingly jealous of her
i have trouble remembering which brony is which
not my fault they are like my sis
is kendall a mod or a weirdo or both, thatll be how i remember from now on
also a transgender
yeah theyre a rad lad
a yes, sportsball. the national pastime.
idk why but they seem to like you even though you are a non brony
they arent trigger happy your just trigger depressed
i know
i just feel guilty for banning a depressed person
if you did something really bad
yeah i picked great mods this time around
agreed
exactly
if you wanna see an example
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
yeah that's not good, especially not now in the me too era
this was what he said to me a month agp
what kind of play would you have said yes to?
pok√©mon d/p wifi battle
harmful to himself
if someone was really harmful i would have called ida to jump on them
sorry i have an appointment for hammering hails into my kneecaps
but snails are god
can we go to italy?
sure i know where grandpa flubs left the key to his house
i wouldnt try to get it though its fucking filled with bees
better than wasp
things sure have changed
you troll me
nooo
if you don‚Äôt die
great now that i said i will imma get hit by a train on my way to work or something
we need to protect flubs
gummy guess what
oh and fries too

kugal that's like saying "my legs hurt, let's do an iron man"
im a professional dumbass
but iron man barely uses his legs hes in fuckin power armor
they havent made me sick yet
his power armor hurts so he flys to oregon or whatever and makes his suit explod
so i accidentally did this again
why are you excited about seeing kugal in pain
yea thats mean üò¶
no not that
www.gummy.com
it sucks and i hate it
becuase that's usually the most expensive part of it
and that star and me will have less control
it is
are you doing things
that you do
he doesn't think
gummy out here spitting straight fucking fire lmao
as for a gummyland website, thats actually gonna be a real thing, plus with the last season of mlp, a launch of this website will help
so i made accounts and pretended to be someone else
i need to sleep off this burn
okay this website building is harder than i thought
well it is hump day
fuck tuesday
i was up all night dry heaving, gpt 2 hours of sleep, worst pain ever
thanks
i can't believe my sis got addicted to this stuff
im just bitter not mature
i think the materials for my calc iii class are free üòÆ
flubs can i borrow $200?
$224 for me
can i have flubs currency?
.0000000375 usd
$100 for chocolate?! is this switzerland?

pop rocks are hot garbage
oops animal man said something dumb
i'm a wuss that can't eat hard candy

gummy i'll tutor you
whats a group of math lovers called
if i cloned myself
hmm getting a job at ebgames....
you know you want to
maybe
did you see my msg above?
im thinking about trying to apply
yeah they seem chill
you voted for my sis?
damn you flubs
was it because she likes smash bros and zelda?
gummy we are no longer friends
i actually don't like that game as much as some other people do
now im only making these things off games i have done before
why would i email u
i never said you
yes he is
i still have my yahoo email, its kinda crap but it was my first email and i still have important accounts built using it as an email
will i ever get access to my school courses again?
not like i have assignments to do or anything
arson is physics
i mean yea
crap the quote is "i can teach you, but i won't be held responsible for what you do with the knowledge"
it's ok, i forgive you
and my last name twice
look it's not like i told him to do it
yeah
ohhh she is gonna hate me for that one
i think the correct word would be "had" your last name because i think she will be un-relating to you shortly
ready for this?
yeah im not gonna risk it
kugals last name is nerd
change your name
my dad originally wanted to name me carol
or vibaldi
vivaldiblitz
gummy what have you done
by like, a year
drago you suck
maybe he meant phat
blitz is fat
i feel uncomfortable when you are bein so nice
shut up
that better?
blitz from now on
i had steak last night and the night before
not cool
y'know what?
yeah i went there
kugal im banning you
because thats how much i like having you around
he deserves the pizza
everyone here works hard and has their own struggles and deserves pizza
hi always hungry im flubs
i know right *dab*
i think god is mad at me now
i donated $20 of that
it all goes to direct relief
aww but why?
dragonite gets it
thats for my collection!
instead of running away, you're coming closer?
only i'm allowed to kill my sister
i wouldn't even try smoking tho
wait why do when i search "mordred" in gifs there are a lot of animations of her without many clothes
or have safe search on like me
wow drago is right
i mean even if it wasnt cold id reccomend at least a first layer
kugal you can post some naked singularities there or something
now that is a nice pick
even though yanis has the sexiest accent
fuck those guys
eh, not really
you wear dresses
...what
in april
venice is garbage right
me in medieval town
i actually don‚Äôt look that bad....
just put dragon runes on it
one of my favs
he is safe
he likes pokemon drago
you should already be bowing yes
alright then
yes, my commandment is that all subjects shall be made to read danganronpa
guys my garbage disposal says "insinkerator" on it how do you feel about that
oh it did
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
when gummy tricks me into joining the mlp server
did you just ask me on a date?
this ain‚Äôt a mlp server
my dogs face is unusually wet
he probably washed his face
yes he washed his face in my lap which hes been sitting in for a couple hours now
i give my dog less than a fist sized bit of food every day and he finishes it like 1/2 the time
i second that
hes a weirdo?
no she was already a weirdo
oh gosh
then broke one kinda
but i threw it on the ground
lmao
are you sure this isn‚Äôt eyan?
gummy i got 100 on todays history test are you proud of me
tell me about it
and it ended off with obama's presidency
my history book went up to him when i took a history class while he was still in his first term
does his name mean fart in scottish
i can't imagine it'll be that positive though
alright i think thats all im gonna say on that to not stir shit
it's okay kugal we're adults
pretty much
classes get really passionate and those only have like 40 - 80 people as it is
probably one of the more interesting things of the class
we got to go home from school after just an hour
that's about when we went home
we were not there for a terribly long time
8:46 am and 9:00 am according to my history book
jesus
on the upside i got 96 on a physics test i was sure i'd fail
it was fun
thats a lot of significant digits
good drago
what game
on no
yea wtf china
wait
welp
since his bday is on 9/11
give me
you mean like the big things on the power lines?
gummy i dont know if those are safe to have in your house
only if flubs plays with me though
sure drago
funny you mention that
okay if the file ever opens
is it a dating sim drago
all right anyway
you can probably piece the rest together lol
who's masae
no it was yours
you're just useless
can you put that in one message so i can pin it?
wait i can just pin both
you could also screenshot it and pin the screenshot
fuck you
though im the favourite
nooooo
cool
didn't even know until 30 seconds ago
so basically, it's probably going to come out around holiday2022?
i made a new anthem
gummy go away, away, away
today, today, today
200 slices
how?
just cut any pizza into 50 slices
alright drago
but only if it's veggie pizza
give me meat
what the crap is lood
it means lewd
i no longer have a keyboard addiction
wait what kind of keyboard?
this was a used one for $62?
what mechanical switch do you have?
theyre reds iirc
why is your server so loud
flubs please tell me that is a rhetorical question
did i ask a question?
god im really starting to fuckin lose it
here no one gives a shit
sup my dude
you fell on the floor right?
ooooh
calculate the impedance of an lrc circuit
typos
kugal stop being young
what the hell gummy
i knew he died
im already awake tho
well
alright looking to replace my two monitors and i got a few options
the american education system sucks
seeing as how i don't care
imma teach you then sis
since my monitors aren't full hd
i think two slightly better ones is better than one great one. after a certain points monitors dont need to be much better
thanks
close to $2k
mine was 700, dropped another 80 on ram and another 80 on two more hard drives because you can never have enough hard drives
fun fact about animal crossing in smash is that if you play on the animal crossing stage between 8 pm and midnight on a saturday, k.k slider will be playing music
i wanna play now
i got see the pikachu movie
5 times
its 8 notes long and loops infinitely
did you listen to the song i said sounds like benny?
soo thats why i think of benny
or is he the one that founded the usa
movie was sold out
what kind?
yummy
gummy here to protect you
you should talk about how the new york mets are going to have a very good summer
how about im edgy
*noms ribs* i like ribs
i guess most of them were like drago you are a banana or whatever
im seeing a pattern here
üòÆ cupcakes!!!
mine are vanilla
so like
why not put it in a kids show?
i think its a good thing, we should normalize it
i'm all for normalizing it, but i don't personally think it needs to be in shows for young kids
i think kids tend to know about sexuality/feelings a lot earlier than people seem to realized
true
i love gossiping
real
ohhh mb
i think i should have said girls
my brother wants to be a teacher and he goes "um, er, well" even more often than i do
source: he went and pointed that out
so flubs you are wrong
i got problems with commas
hes the worstest
looks good actually
bad pic but you get the point
i only share cupckaes with cool people
i made a pony
then made it in human form
and this pony is based off me
i hate you
you're awful
good
dont get sick
this is us
which one is you
wait a minute
i love flubs
yeet
it would also be funny to have ida there babysitting us but that might be logistically more of a challenge
hey kugal want to join us at magfest
i may dwell on here.
flubs
its great
fuck you commander holly
jared did a bad
what was her name again >.>
she was his ex wide
ya boy is back from the world of maths
no that's not why i want you to go but okay
why you want me?
i want to meet ida because i want to know if she's as grumpy irl as she is online, i mean uh, because she seems nice
just catch her on a good mood
i dunno if he'd like traveling
ida has a bunny?
made a <#578002937544966145> channel
going to have to remember that exists
thats absurdly funny gummy
im not sure if that's how it works but sure
imagine being that full of confidence
oh no
flubs help
i recommend shitting
no please go on im almost there
if drago's ever suspected of a crime, this is who they'd send for the interrogation
so cute
should i troll them?
he yells a lot
baby charlie!
that's a shit idea
ida are you in the process of waking up, or in the process of going to bed?
she died
ida you hurt my feelings
<:fluttercry:570771095033085952>
<:kurisusip:561042019112321034>
wait what
now lets see what mr ken does
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
<:smugsip:569872790518366208>
hey im better
here
they explain what it does so often
well in that case
god i hate this fucking planet
anything i can help with?
it's been a rough few years for me
i know i haven't always shown that on here but yeah
thanks
people currently active in zeal send their regards
give him cake
pizza
good good
eleven hours of sleep is fine right?
star is that you?
there are too many rarities in this chat
there's only one.
first is still smb 1, because of strong nostalgia.
lost level was too hard
it's my favorite from all 2d scroller ones.
what consoles you through your entire life?
it does in a way.
nice.
try to get one that's not on life support
life support?
because it's very old and was used for several thousands of hours
so now my working 3ds doesn't leave my desk ever
i see.
maybe a few
why aren‚Äôt you in gummyland today?
only we two.
she's a brony too?
she refuses to watch with me
we might be celebrating tonight
no about graduating
i see.
i tried
my brother also graduated hs too, his walk on stage was legendary lmao
did he trip?
never
they post clop. it's disgusting.
guys
nah sounds entertaining
then it's going to spend most of the time on the battlefield giving you a look of disdain
mjhvbjjkh
i think i have an extra one in the shed if you want it
thats impressive
92% on criminology final and holy bollocks i got 11% on my calc 2 final
and he would look at his left
at driver
i feel so lied to
i just ate an oatmeal cookie thinking it was peanut butter
(ida you didn‚Äôt have to point put the obvious)
it cost me $120 just to take the exam
120 fucking dollars
i bought a webcam becuase it was required, those are expensive from what they want me to get
such bullshit
i still plan on being at streams but i think it was a good decision for me to leave the server
wait you left zeal?
on wednesday, that's why dragonite asked how i was
was rainy creeping you out?
she too nice to me now üò£
sis*
on duty
for some reason the idea of gummy being a shepherd is way funnier than the idea of ida being a shepherd
shepherdess
whichever
you wouldn't be entirely wrong gummy
one would say enough to drive you insane
gummy
remember that one time ida described how you have to grab the rams by their horns to make them go where you want them to go, or something?
hey i frighten easy as well
we were in ireland two years ago and literally my brother's favorite part was when we went around dingle and we got to pet some sheep
they're terrified of humans
good idea
and also they were probably used to humans because they were owned by an old guy who was like "two euros and you can give them food and pet them for as long as you like"
plus i am clumsy and will end up hurting myself in a way
i'd pay at least eight and a half dollars to see that
hey maybe you can herd her bunny instead
i would do it
if you can come up with a more creative name
since that is her real name yeah lol
i didn't know
ha no one calls me by real name
flubs name is steven
the army of ste
a decent amount of people know my name by now
sis's name is charlotte
and also i sort of imagine he spent a lot of time smoking weed
nope the opposite actually
i'm bad
well still dont make drugs at yourself because two wrongs dont make a right
i remember doing track & field in junior high
i came in last place in both races
im trying to download this platinum emulator
brb shower probably
1.37 miles
one person said i ran fast
and an elderly couple i ran pass pretty sure thought i was crazy
so just wait for me to kick it and then ill get right on that
noooooooooooooo
try that flubs
running with a backpack on is very taxing
june 12th is bella's bday then 13th it goes sour
i dont think its going to be march, it's cold in march
why are you bothering with whatever month is coming up
13th in 2015
schleep.
gummy is merciful.
lmfao
i dislike math personally.
it's my favorite math class to date
nice.
wish me luck

meh.
hell yea
i already did i love that channel to death
im trying to sleep
i want chipotle right now
even though never seen one

hey chuck

but here roast beef
so last night as i was printing, i learned that there are things called spherical coordinates and cylindrical coordinates
hey it looks like patricks legs
it looks like a butt
you need to try harder
flubs tonight
gummy those two teams are parts of so many sports now
league of legends
shots fired
kek.
now flubs needs to song
i think for everyones sake i need to not do that
here
you used to listen to it for like a month
i am not elaborating on that statement
too small
eat it
my favorite pizza is round table
you are making me hungry
im making myself hungry lmao
crispy chicken burger
there's a lot of shit i havent had gummy
the rest are up to the other people

i gotta think of good math emotes then
do it
<:charlie:579566514248744963>
im working on new emotes here
so no xkcd 303?
star
hey i said limit to 2
no even a single star emote.
id make a bunny one but im feeling lazy
so flubs when are the fortnite videos returning?
thats easy
like that will smith movie
i experienced it a few times with cs:go.
i used to play mario kart wii out the ass in high school and then i didnt play it for like a year and when i came back it was like what are fingers
and thats why minecraft is the best game ever created
drago you upset people
i hate that show
ooo gummyland raid
can't remember her actually banning anyone, but ok.
anyone from a raid.
i wish i'd remembered that trick during the recording but oh well
just barely annoying enough to not get a new one
hey flubs if a poison expires, does it get more deadly or less deadly?
when stuff expires it just gets worse at doing what it does. milk tastes worse, meat makes your body explode from disease, etc
flubs stop hitting on uni students
we're both made of atoms so sure
yeah but dont you run him on a pi
and thats made of atoms and shit
just let me know when the "next time" happens to be
time to see salty people
time to see if its been uploaded to the internet yet
of course they are
i hate game of thrones
have you seen the petition flubs?
sooo when will walking dead end?
don't you also hate that show?
wow a lot will end in 2019
there's more to come
what?
besides iw
like spiderman far away from home?
oh 100%
i think it was only made to introduce her for endgame
im surprised you don't watch the dc stuff
and what have you seen so far?
maybe
it was many moons ago
bad year
jake paul is trending
reason why is because he wants to stop cyberbullying....
i forget does the internet like or hate boogie now
i think i remember a disproportionate number of people being classic internet condescending pricks to him over something undoubtedly small
and drago it's funny
boom roasted!
gummy beat him to it so gummy gets the point
how will i function?
i need someone to remind me not to do something stupid everyday
i suppose you could return an array or an object containing multiple values if you want
cone of shame
when is sis gonna get online
good!
have some more
gotta spice things up
you post a pizza picture then
and i also have to go back after that so yeah its a while
great
flubs can i borrow $999 for this?
noooo
you can borrow $999 for a big pizza though
how big?
so big it costs 1000 dollars
"$1,000 pizza sold at nino‚Äôs restaurant in nyc features caviar, lobster"
thats all i know
its fish eggs
its also fake rich person food
now thats something i would do
if you need to flaunt your wealth, it isnt real
*getting* money makes people evil. money is great
god if my metabolism ever slowed down id be such a fatass
luckily thatll never happen so we're good
probably some yogurt idk
yeah but im only gonna be up for another hour ish so thats ok
you are up late
ooo pc givaway flubs
might as well just replace my pc for this...
my newspaper likes to advertise computers sometimes
so i looked at the specs
that was it
darn
and try not to over work yourself
keep up with your strength
hmm, then try something liquid
been trying to drink water and fruit juice
so you don't overwork yourself
sleep is proving to be more difficult
because if you can't sleep, try to relax and clear your mind
i assume you fell asleep, night sis *hugs*
prob a good idea
i thought the bot only talks when you say his name though
and it did nothing
that sounds like a good metaphor for life
last time i had one was in 2015 and i caught it right after going through the college of winterhold quest, and to this day i feel queasy when playing the college of winterhold quest
ah, pavlovan conditioning
happened when i was in elementary school too
tbh i should sleep as well soon
go sleep
drago go sleep
fine lets explore the city instead
alright i will add all of those
sup peeps
hai there gumbotron
pretty good
good thing my mom just gave me a whole box of chocolates
can i have some
dark?
what do yall think of this picture of me
yes that is my leg but thats irrelevent
thanks
aww thans
i know right
<:wat:579563576914870333>
watch it flubs
ayy 100 on my part 2 final for english
how many do you have now?
you don't need to replace the headset
cool
im bored flubs
im talking a 45 second, big long yell. i cant even whisper that long
only slightly less photon-black-hole-ish
ah yea
people are so dumb these days
flubs created the world
either that or the universe is (essentially) flat and the world is curved
how do you know i'm even wearing pants in the first place
you are wearing shorts*
in which case go ahead
what happen was in animal crossing today, a fortune teller told me to wear shorts to avoid luck so i said on stream that i should take my pants off
some other web sites would let you do that probably
the exception being when i have to go outside in the winter months
nope
when i wear shorts
in _may_
i call her crazy also though so it's okay
is she crazy?
i'm sure my mom must think that about me too
my grandma is the craziest person i know
so my mom has had plenty of time to get used to it
6 more followers and if i can maintain 3 average views
though she got pissed off at me during the stream, mostly for fun
yeah
because i asked my viewers my starter pokemon
prob not gonna stream ultra sun for the rest of the week
she has work all week and weekend
so i think maybe an early morning animal crossing stream
her fiancee is michael from mandjtv
he apparently said to someone during a stream they should die a horrible death
yeah...worse than my pants joke
how long have you known gummy? i dont think that even makes it into like my top 80
yeah.
there is still time for you to escape, starlight
flubs i known since july 12th 2017
~~just to suffer~~
he lives to mock you.
i could be, for example, a gummy
lmfao
drago you are a gummy worm
but what do you expect from a guy that likes muskets?
the cane is only to be used for the betterment of society
then you can be an infinite number of triangles
and i dont know why i installed it in the first place
origin is a bad launcher
hmm i need to be in class in like ten minutes
kek.
i got 96 on the physics final woo
seems like my server now has a similar issue with that but instead of an account called the greatest, we have an account called ‚Äúflippy‚Äù
remember when you told me about the greatest account?
that they might be some server bot thing?
that might have been it
makes flubs a milkshake
watch miraculous ladybug flubs
kek.
oh drago when you get up i need to tell you something
we need to do an old folks vc again
though we need a replacement for the other 3
i'm trying to avoid dairy for now since it's not uh
good after being sick
even if you can't sleep
star shush
that's nice of you.
well as long as you got sleep that is good
yea.
thats cute
drago
well real time sub counts
youtube crackin down on the channels that center around drama prolly lmao
i hate to say this because it's a very interesting system but i feel like socialblade isn't going to last regardless of what youtube does
true
they let you see the specs on your competition but other than that you just get so much more data from analytics
hey drag join freedom yet?
bunni that is not a bunny
i decided to chase after a scammer
i thought the same thing, gum.
you should tell the service about it.
hes not that crazy
they're very kind to canadians there
thats true
so that's convenient
lol yeah
well i won't be leaving the resort, that's for sure
as soon as they were sitting near the fountain and pikachu told tim he knew his father would be proud
plus the bad guy...really, he meets the guy thats says his son is the bad guy...really...that early in the movie?
but man these movies are so predictable
lets build a city for good purposes
im so close
thanks demon lord for donation btw
and im really not, i just like streaming with my ex a lot
yeah i remember you saying that
which is why i'm never buying bits or subscribing to anyone
i mean isn't every site money grubbling?
and the culture on the site is so toxic and bleeds into so many other things
i know facebook and youtube does the whole money grubbling things as well
oh yes the memes are dumb
and twitch also has this "here's a thing you can do to support your streamers but actually we take most of it"
oh yeah they do, do that
bits and subs
is to directly donate???
but direct donations are the best
problem is i don't have anyone that i really like who streams/does youtube...
wait you're giving me an artist?
im finding an artist to commission a drawing for you
on youtube
but amazon is cool
grossest thing in the internet is dragonite
drago 1675
was creating this server not enough
this server isn't crazy
maybe you dont
and they died because the new person died?
and then she left
gummy now you see the problem
also demon lord
because isn't this place technically zeal?
well zeal was different for me
this place is a lot more outgoing
no this place isn't composed 30% of people who need to go out and see some sunshine
you could always have put it in the trash can
drago you donate
no thanks i like my money
good news, i unlocked vip on twitch
she actually knows how to entertain people
and flubs how is this place better?
gummy
hes my everything etc etc
true believers
oh if no one knows, meet starlight, my head admin
it's awful someone even made it
yanis has conflict with you two sometimes
it gives me a headache
was yanis the one who sorta went into cardiac arrest when told him to stop thinking about things he hates for ten seconds
you never met yanis before drago
and he is french
floral was fun
yeah thats floral to you
salty 30 year old
i don't dislike him
that's terrifying
also we need to do an old folks vc again
compost
your choice
you wanna be rolled in toilet paper?
pay me
babies
caffeine drago
have fun with that
wanna help
im pretty sure im a god. i just swiped a spider off my face and it fell straight down my sink drain
but you might have hurt the spider's feelings
exactly
top kek.
was the most i had
kiddies
tonight i will stream for 10 secs at midnight
he's just in denial
<:wat:579563576914870333>
im immortal
iron man.
<:shrug:579725441099890689>
you gotta be careful of friction gummy
i mean she's probably just going to tell you to do it sustainably, too
she ain‚Äôt lewd
thank you sis
no yo udont
the mlp was the only thing that was different
a lot
or transformers?
yay!
<:wat:579563576914870333>
i see...
if you are ever asking if im biased
all right..
so i can announce my special day?
looooolll
how do you fail a tax form
flubs i can't tax
but also good job
hold on
availability of stormy
but you should get a schedule. and a job. and friends. and other stuff
alright flubs
okay discord ruined that
yes it does
it sucks and i hate it?
i‚Äôll take that as an eh!
also ida something possessed me to poke through the hold tla roleplay today
give me the bits
in the usa they are
they're free in the us?
for watching ads
also the ads are super loud and shit
and half the time you wont even get bits for the ads
gummy banner is done
that's already like a 3x better ad rate than on youtube videos
plus i have ublock origin. lol.
and congrats
the ones you watch for bits
those get around it. so you do still have to watch them
i'd subscribe to gummy.
flubs what?
let me guess, it'll be a rarity emote
maybe sylveon
flubs can pick
pick rarity.
flubs this is the worse time to sub to me
the worst*
you guys picked a horrible time to sub lol
also guys i have to admit something...
you're terrible at everything?
admit what?
he cut school the day of the big math test
oh yeah hes a liar and a cheat
oh i made fake accounts on my forums
active
when ida and i had second accounts for the rp thread we'd go into the chatbox and yell at ourselves sometimes
right ida?
too bad i never fight with sis anymore
unfortunately the logs from the chatbox dont exist anymore, there were some gems in there
fun fact sis not stormy is the person who can calm me down the fastest
better than your banner drago!
becasue it'd ignite instantly
well
my banner has a reference to everything
does that count?
s is blue based on rarity's dress colour
no tiberia was me
gummy you know this
he was crazy
are you going to tell the fishing pole story
drago went friendly
then he went super mean when zeal server was made
then when i left for first time he went friendly
hes been friendly ever since
flubs is weird where he loved me
i was mean to him because bella had just left
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115>
lemme cross-reference that real quick
kek.
i chased after a girl who was mean to me
star
isn't that worst?
so seems like our fights are better
yay!
which i need to make ding dongs joke
it's me, a boy
to the server of fun people
pink it is
i gave the the role of the moose
or more im not sure
ooh canada boys
demonlord and gummy are in the land of canada
lol yep
what have the peoples been up to
and i only learned about it today
doing well besides feeling like i should be productive right now
my sleep schedule is jacked too
i like the new profile pic
or however you spell that, i don't keep track of pok√©mon much these days xd
you spelled it right lol
:o lol
cuba :o
i've known quite a few people who've gone there
also there's a direct flight to there from where i live
convenience rocks
aww nice
it's not a surprise though, it was her idea actually
well that sounds like fun
yeah i've never been on a trip like that before so it should be fun
sick
i've been barely out of the state let alone country lol
lol same
i've been to the us quite a few times, mostly just minnesota since i'm only 45 minutes away
last last summer i was *supposed* to travel, by car, to wisconsin but plans got cancelled and im still a travel virgin
didn't get to see the capital sadly lol
well we drove all the way to arkansas so i guess that kinda counts as going to a few states lol
alright i'll brb peoples
oh my this place talks without gummy starting the convo
welp
flubs is a jock
drago
yes i am
anyone who dies is dumb
and flubs
or turpentine
i‚Äôll tell sis on you
my sis protects gummy
ah mobile
dont go that dark, moose
fabulous
i have no work!
i dont know code but sure
i tried
drago sleep
im gonna attempts to stay up all night
drago cant, his doorway is too small
remember he's like 7' 2" or however tall dragonites are
im small
am i tol or smol
thats not a pokemon
i thought yahoo was second most popular
interesting
the fuck
you can't talk to kevin
morning
how did you even find that
me too
charlie knows how to make life hell for me
what he do?
wtf today is tuesday?
but benny is faster
except he isnt really gentle, if he steps on your foot it fucking hurts
gummy do i want to know why you are google searching my username
charlie doesnt slobber on me, im an expert of avoiding teh slobber
sure
alright sounds cool
hope charlie doesn‚Äôt eat me
nah he'll just howl at you from 10 feet away
gummy i have my own anti-charlie bible
bye charlie!
not my joycons, them bitches expensive
how much are they actually
youch
its cheaper to buy a pro controller then 2 joycons
$376 cad
it's a dinosaur
unless the graphics card is way underpowered and the botw people just did some insane black magic to make the game work. they probably did.
hmmm
he'd say sylveon is a good pok√©mon
ive been waiting six years for my dragoniteite
or i could make drago mad saying im returning to youtube
/lenny
are you really still stalking me
loopy or katsukity?
my loopy card actually still works it's just the 3ds itself thats on the fritz
you should touch yours- that sounded a _lot_ better in my head
a what?
he nearly murdered my balls when he threw me a pack of mambas
oh like a hit in the nuts
of course that server becomes pretty active when i'm asleep.
yes.
yes.
he's gentle 95% of the time
back in like 2006
those were the days
im worried about this now
if people give me money on twitch
youtube walkthroughs (plural) / let's play (singular)
shit
mhmm
i want honest truth?
it's simpler
i like both but the second one pleases my brain more
well, not symmetrical but you get what i mean
scroll up
remember the old days of camelot
actually i don‚Äôt remember much
i was?
it was you, master, and i
i don‚Äôt fully remember
lets try to make this the golden age again
dont try to recreate what has passed
thats a good idea
yea probably idk
<:dan:579731005317971969>
we have all the people i want here
theres people
i think drago and i need to roast each other more
thats attitude
well there we go
the rules are there are no rules
2 be nice
booo
the morning hours are an amazing time of introspective awakening
i want pancakes
ugh i got a busy day tomorrow
congratulations!
i wanna play in the snow sis
yes drago we too nice now
i like how we're two days away from june and idaland still has snow
thats the only thing i didn't change
well flubs, the guy is on meds now and plus if i ban him i might be responsible for a suicide
i have a cool mnemonic to remember this kind of thing
if it is your mental state you are responsible for it. if it isn't you aren't
and people are generally more active
all the mods who well didn‚Äôt work or gone
youre not his mom
if you spend your whole day watering your neighbors lawn, your lawn will remain unwatered
except for the part where he was being toxic and/or making the other humans in your server uncomfortable
kugal don't you start
team up against him
wow thats mean
gummy we should do something special for twosday
the ss forum dudes were planning a tenth forum anniversary event like, a year in advance
the anniversary was last year
we're still planning it
i demand to be invited!
will!
nice nice
lol ^w^
<:wat:579563576914870333>
the shapes are bigger and closer
top kek.
my game boy player start up disc finally arrived!
a what now?
they allow you to play gba games on your tv
since no one plays gba games on the go anymore i figured i may as well get one now
what's that
then there was the game boy micro which no one had
it came out after the ds
well flubs
i like cookies and milk
with the native americans
muy interesante
nice
ya boy may or may not have pulled another all nighter
operation stupid is starting
wow they shaved off a whole dimension
also this bus smells like piss
yummy
i think the 2ds xl is the best one personally
i forget why i got a 3ds xl instead of a 2ds xl
would have been way cheaper
yeah imma go get 2ds xl
you there
which one?
thanks
she said it‚Äôs better to save money and wait till i have an income before i spend
or else i might go on a spending spree
and no way im taking my capture card 3ds around
probably
alrught
99% think corphish and his gf broke up
he already hinted something if you are around his twitter, plus i can tell by the way he acts, he's borderline depressed
yeah i dug around his twitter
but i can tell they both aren't on each other's description
you might remember i was suspicious about eyan and nightshade breaking up
rainy and eyan seem to last
more just people having fun
rainy and eyan have the most sixth-grader relationship ive ever seen and i love it
and i hate it
yes but how much
a lot
rawr
hey it was made in 2014
the one where i got accepted into rpm network when i was a senior in high school and then like a month later youtube was like hey, you dont need an mcn to be partnered anymore
checks out
i dont remember so, no
lmao
sort of in the same way that having all of your legs amputated sounds fun
you shed a little bit of weight but on the other hand holy crap you dont have any more legs
i remember my first thumbnail was in paint
whyd rago
why drago
someone told me to
the hell
ive always assumed it was your upbringing but it could always just be your basic nature
because your skill is susceptible to breakage under immense force
thats even worse
drago screw you
there's a party going on in vc :o lol
all right so since he's not answering i'll just tell bunni that flubs is the robot
i'm not dead :o lol
i feel deeply offended
haven't streamed for a week rip lol
last surprise? lol
they added a handful of songs
welcome person lol ^w^
when's my birthday gummy? lol
im just playing smash bros
ive had so many cats
i have 2 currently
i wish i has a cat lol
adorable kitty <3 lol
"easy"

no emotes then rip lol xd
yeah i think it took almost a week for my first emote but 2 or 3 days for my second one

i'mma be leaving the vc too.
playing brutal doom rn.
have fun lol ^w^
lol xd
a cool person? lol
ooh lol

they're totally not screenshots and stuff <:bsdderp:584676007664156675>
holy guacamole
quote of the day in another server. you'll know when you see it lol
is there no times new roman in google docs? how have i never noticed this before
oooo
much better than chrome.
flubs you missed a big vc here yesterday
also bunni was there and she doesn't sound like a robot
so i'm very grateful for that
the one night i go to bed before midnight lol
eyyy
rip lol
i should do it
i wanna see what's on /r/calculus now
welp reddit just died for me
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115>
hey i know i barely met you guys but i need data for research on a video im oding
feel free to vote multiple
i was streaming this morning
i was probably asleep then lol
nice lol ^w^
she has the personality to keep my stream alive
i love how rarely anyone promotes their stuff in this server
when this server is made for self promo
here is an example
indeed.
<:bsdderp:584676007664156675>
a danganronpa character
that too
not sure
everyone is gay
you're a girl?
hey gummy wanna go out on friday?
back off, she's mine.
it‚Äôs a good meme
the switch will release most wii u games
gummy, you can give me your wii u.
i don‚Äôt have one
even if you get one for free
wii had even more great games.
oh it also had mario mak - oh wait
which nobody played
because ive been too busy using my wii u as capture scaffolding for wii games
but i also dont feel like spending money
ahh 8 am
sounds like war music
now this is relaxing
obligatory
so drago
xenoblade
thats a short game
kirby is a fun game.
there
where in god's name ddi you find that
i typed dragonitespam banner
i know
booo
note that it does not have a due date
gummy stop reading my notes
and my sis is on this server
all people are garbage
i realized everyone that works for me is an asshole, an idiot, or a bootlicker
i honestly cant tell which of the three is worse
idiot
without question
or an asshole
but are we friends though?
or sis depends who wants to hang out with me on my bday
because im amazing
who esle is excited for a new season of black mirror
milk expiring is like the death of a loved one you monster
or you put it on craigslist and ship them a brick with an image of your junk taped on it
i try not to
all the first male flubses are named mike
idk somewhere upstate probablyu
well i want gummy relatives
you wouldnt like being a flubs
i think gummy was asking you out
sis nooo!
wanna actually be related to me sis? ~~i can hook you up with one of my french cousins~~
they seem to have one thing in common with me
i got cousins
i hurt my hand carrying a chair
hey no roasting me
sooo the guy who looks like drago who is depressed showed me his prom pics
you know the one in zeal
and is getting depressed since the girl didn't want more
booo
i mean i did reach out to him back when he was really depressed back in zeal
late bunni?
like right now?
no drago it's fine, he is depressed
sure i can wait
okay
i can't stay up too late either
i dont want to deal with myself
jeff was one of the few people who was able to make eyan angry
that should say it all
yeah but he had memes in the way r/frenworld has memes
shall i play ranked game and hope i be done
which i guess it's a good thing
i didn't want bringina to see since she and i joke about essay a lot
and i didn't want her to see me angry like this
yall is plural so it woild be more correct to say yall are weird _gummies_
for everyone especially bringina to see
bringina has never seen my grumpy side and i hope she never does
no flubs that what gummy and i so
drago i rarely get ticked off by him
only a few times
on second thought this sounds like a lot of effort
and like 1/3 of the population speaks english but the other 2/3 yell
that time
i miss them
invite the uncle
go to sleep gummy. listen to ida.
not me
well now someone has to use kissing booth then all channels will be used
superyummying.
very minimal amount of fat too
yea i don't either, i like a little because when you cook it it renders down and makes even juicier
i like but hate food
still up?
oh shit youre still in school?
i mean it was kinda obvious but not
what subjects?
physics and us history
nice ^w^
here i am still not even close lmao
managed to get level one on my server with nitro boosting
my server invite is like....
welp need to get on pc first
does this server need boosting?
im considering something stupid
hmm what should i do to get more people?
im on university probation
i like how you actually included your pc specs in your description
of money
and if you sold mario 3d world with it you could probably get a fair bit
my pc doesnt need specs
im too cheap to buy a web cam
but i managed to take 100% of it
no drago
thought you own one
my sister has a wii u game so in order to sell everything
no my cpu isn‚Äôt twice
it‚Äôs just the full power supply
well guys
why both we have all the stuff we need
well this server doesn‚Äôt have nitro people besides me and sis
i doubt zeal has any either
so on average you're ordinary
average isn't median
that is to him what xkcd 303 is to me
i think i got that from animal man
right now i am too hyper
next tuesday i get the best haircut of all time and im so pumped
oh you know what maybe you can do this
kugal i will pay for your haircut if you do that
done
i didnt see anythign would be a lie
shhhhhh
im reading 50 shades of drago
ya wanna know a fun fact about the human body?
good job
that is good
do i even want context for the line "50 shades of flubs"
either that or 49 pages of me crying and one of me masturbating *while* crying
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115> <:revolver:582671595235966976>
flubs i thought you never cry
drago
it sucks and i hate it
how dare he get a switch
i have a new 2ds so screw that
the firmware in the joycons wants to update
the screen protectors do not need a firmware update
well flubs
it‚Äôs tight
17-14 wow
god damn it
oooh, ad astra looks sick af
no i mean no he cant have it
yeah two years ago almost
guys
youtube is going through another adpocolypse
if i got the news then yeah many have
why do you have a sheep in your computer silly
i don‚Äôt want a new one since i will upgrade a lot next year
hmmm
could also be a final fantasy game though
send it here
flubs
do i need it to be the same brand of ram?
i know it has to be ddr3
sometimes i confused my left with my right and it makes me feel like a special kind of stupid
so that's the part of your brain that got retrofitted as a space to store extra calculus
actually the same
i can never remember what's left and what's right
oh you know what else i do?
those are a l classic six day a week moment kugal
i picture a piano to remember the difference between left and right
one time my mom accidentally put chocolate milk syrup on my waffles when she was on autopilot
see at least thats sugar on sugar
let's go with acid
im pretty sure you're right
stress, some other issues, and i was soaking wet leaving my university today because it rained hard
i've been feeling the weirdest mix of guilt from being off of school
there's just something satisfying about going places in the rain
i like it when its a light sprinkle
what did you lie about you rebel
like did you tell em your dog ate your hw
pc3-12800 ddr3 1600
drago is about to part with some first edition ddr100 ram and he doesnt even know it
it's a holo-foil charziard on the back
pic pls
i should do some research
a very weird part of me wants to cut mine short
and yet i'm still probably gonna do it. i'm a fool
get out of here with your proverbs ya nerd
got em
gummy is that you?
speaking of money i just paid a $360 fee to my college for calc 3
oh right
i dont believe in mornings
kugal
same honestly
not that pizza
gummy why do you have a petri dish in a pizza box
and the year skyrim came out
but it‚Äôs giving me a stomachache
gummy this is why you dont eat off of petri dishes
yummy\
i like food
even more treason
my bot must be stopped
so did zeal server get boosted?
what is he doing in my sis‚Äôs room?
i am very confused right now
anyone wanna share these cookies and milk with me
they're yummy
will gets some cookies
this is big brain time
buzz buzz
did you finally buy one of those sheep from ida or something?
the lady
you don't need to, you already have a cool accent
maybe russian
it may work or it may fry my pc
nice!
probably more like 25, since it's not shiny and new, as if that matters for ram
also i feel like i didnt hear _anybody_ speculating about emile playing chrono trigger until like, three days ago
on twitter they were
i thought he would be
same
and beat drago in yt once again
like, the entirety of it
it's going to be twenty-six seconds long
is that your sister?
i feel like i should have an entire hard drive full of those by now but i dont
here is my dank meme
some moron destroyed my gummyland poll
and they didnt invite me?
it was a straw poll
i had it set to check ip
which option did they vote for?
yes.
so guys
who wants to bet chuggaaconroy dies after 20 episodes?
some of those bosses can be rough
ct is one of those games that feels longer than it actually is
i havent done that since december
yall are clearly playing a different isaac because i thoguht it was the most boring thing ever
well tell him to do them fast because im busy tonight
i'll bundle it with the ram
do you want my pc fried drago?
give it to blitz
sis is watching this in the background knowing i lost too many brain cells
welp
which one?
one of them has cleaner lines
the other seems like it's got tv static in the background
i like the top one too
thanks
it's cool to see another him doing another non nintendo game
the only other 2 he did were okami and sonic colors
i like it in the actual avatar better
kiddies
i thought that was just an urban legend
cool
well shoot
reason being is gummyland is too self center towards me
i mean i got 172 people so im happy
if you want a server all about me well you are in it currently
though then drago took over
why aren‚Äôt you arrested then?
i might need to get a custom server icon that can either animate or not depending on
alright so this server is basically what i intended gummyland to be back then
a friends only server not public
that being said, feel free to invite who you want here, rules are strict but no nsfw pics and stuff, you can kinda talk about nsfw stuff depending on what it is but no pics
also no bullying people or swimming
no nsfw pictures
and most but not all do have mod powers here
this is basically like early gummyland days without ponies
god fucking damn it
if server changes name
i have to change everything
will did that for her server and its glorious
you dont actually lol i was just joking
it'll make conversation with my non-lgbt supporting friend much more interesting
i saw a really good tweet recently lemme try to dig it up
guys
only reason streams are alive is because stormy gives me a nudge to stream
when i told them not to
funniest part is you guys aren‚Äôt even supposed to watch my stream
i never promote it here so idk how people know
i just ignore them 9 times out of 10 so i miss most streams
asking for a friend
my sample size is uh
well i only know one of you so
or its larger than that but their brain cell count isnt
listen flubs
i dotn mind if youre straight
kugal let'
s be nice to flubs
have you even _seen_ my posture
i thought you said you were demisexual
or however you spell
alright
i guess technically i wouldn't be fully straight since i'm asexual
gummy youre hereby banned from your own land
can i have money
so demon is (straight)^0
so heteromantic would be accurate
that reminds me this happened yesterday
```[11:48 am] dragonite - guru of life: i had a dream that i was having a philosophical conversation with a girl i used to like and now i cant remember what the conversation was about```
burning questions
i hear that
mood
i guess color wise it does?
talk to you weirdos later
he was always in a bad mood
interesting statistic: one in twelve people are born without a soul
who am i kidding no i wouldnt
ask my sis out
gummy seems like he would be about 40% better to be around if you were completely fucking wasted
i need a summary for the reason why
so ida real quick, which of the two of us would enjoy asking the other out the least
what
someone get him hes getting away
i realize i'm probably just making this even worse for myself
nvm i forgot that one guy
(„Å£‚óï‚Äø‚óï)„Å£?
hehehehe
sis wait i have gummy bears and chocolate?
yes ma'am
youve streamed league?
eyan's playing my champion
and i'm here dying in final fantasy
weirdly close to installing ffxiv
i'm way ahead of you, i've gotten three classes to level 70 and i'm still completely incompetent
imma get to level 71
then it'll be 80
it's free for the first month or something right?
though some of the social features are locked
i should probably also re-install eso now that i have the hard drive space for it
you can easily hit the level cap just by doing quests
sounds easy enought
the system requirements page says 40 gb though
on mid-atlantic united states internet
clearly it's called "read"
is it still possible to attach it to my steam account after getting it from square's web site? i wanna broadcast how much of a life i dont have
my email is not in the system
sargatanas is one of those sub-servers on na
i see
weird game
and there is a way to raise chocobos
that game sounds confusing
mmos tend to be that
like i genuinely feel ill being there
all right now the 25 gb download begins
sign me up
cool
hard to describe
~~how gay does she sound~~
it finally installed
oh my
ill refrain from sending you a screenshot
youll see later anyway
oh for god's sake
oh my
im making this gta 5
urgh i basically made her my rp character because im uncreative and making her last name "prima" would be very incorrect but it also sounds the most normal
guess i could just fish up a last name that doesn't suck
wait am i not allowed to strafe
what nonsense is this
okay hold mouse to strafe, i can live with that
oh gummy
also flubs
gummy did you install ffxiv yet
no drago
then you should stream animal crossing
just six days a week
the seventh day starts on sunday and ends on saturday
alright
can you have an odd number of ram sticks? ive never thought about doing that
you can have one
im pretty sure you can have like three if you have the slots, and they dont even need to be of the same size
i put an extra 256(?) mb in my computer (previously 1024 mb) in 2009 and im pretty sure it worked and thought it was the coolest thing ever
but i have borderline ocd
this was me two weeks ago
looks like me playing dishonored 2 on minimum settings lmao
oh boy
yeah
lets do the lower quality rivalry
im coming back on youtube drago
so far stuff has not blown up
drago those are flubs‚Äôs panrs
why the crap did you leave flubs' pants by the mail box
so we don‚Äôt have a mailbox
that‚Äôs on flubs for not protecting me
shit
god damn it sis
you humiliate yourself, i just laugh at the results
also the message didnt mention you by name did it
<:stpc_ppwhatdidyousay:480683452933472276>
since when were the three stooges of camelot role colors red blue yellow
i know
damn i can‚Äôt beat you in anyway
cure me and my morals
there now we have the three stooges role
speaking of which gummy we got to jump on ffxiv later so she can scream at us and then pretend she doesnt know us
hi, gum.
mission complete now to get food because im always hungry
nice.
how you know?
i love french fries.
because that's what you always go for.
i hate everything
wait really?
üéâ now your computer is up to 1980s standards
i kinda regret not just building a new one tbh
well..
i remember arguing with master over a super tower/case and i finally managed to prove it does exist
yes but with the rack for the drives and the ginormigantuan 1080 and the 0 working case fans it doesnt have great airflow
i still cant get the image of superman's decked out rgb pc  out of my head whneever oyu mention it
$1,200
actually it's 903.11 united states dollar
its like something one of my dumbass cousins would buy lol
that is enough pc upgrades for this year hopefully
well a potato can generate electricity under certain circumstances
a pizza is hot
we're havin steak and roasted potatoes tonight hell yea
the potato can be quite violent though
do not anger the potatoes
unless provoked
it all makes sense
you are a potato
no not yet, very soon though
and i prefer the more general term "vegetable" thank you
flubs he's saying you dont get enough exercise
gummy dont tell him what he cant do
i did not expect that answer
golf isnt really about creativity. its about hitting the ball so hard it lands in a hole but not so hard as to make you look like an asshole and embarrass your dad in front of work friends hes trying to impress
you only play golf with others if someone has an ulterior motive
mmmmhmmmm
who is that?
same
it was an on going joke that chewy and i were dating
invite him here if you want
so i can see if i can remember
do any of you people know what im talking about in gummyland?
kendall and i aren't even watching the chat
its the rail on train tracks that murders people who touch it
due to the fast fast many ton machines much stronger than your bones
i like subways
it's whatever
everything is whatever \:d
i dont know half the people here
moose is like my bff
we should vc again soon
oh cool never
oh electricity
i was calling it fast juice because i forgot the word
i'll hit y'all up later
my mom thought it was cute of me to have cookies and milk the other night
gummy get out of bed and go play outside
gummy get out of bed and go for a walk
fine i‚Äôll do the get out of bed part
it's good for you
thats too much
$11.60
oh she changed it i don‚Äôt have to match anymore
another one in my server got banned in manechat <:facehoof:241025290875174912>
but what got him banned was
he‚Äôs not ban in my server but he pisses me off
if it's just you you can still tell him to screw off but it'll be easier if it's everyone
is threatening to kill people who dont exist bad? i mean i know its really sad to watch but is it anything beyond that?
is that code
oh so it was for being a butthole mostly. thats valid
everytime someone wanted to discuss about a villains
and it‚Äôs a cartoon so if villains get redeemed so what?
flubs wanna watch some care bears with me?
god damn it
the evil care bear that wants to destroy the upper class care bears
i rather mod flubs than him there
gummh that was youbwasnt it
well the user account was from another country but still
"we're not strangers, im your fan"
i was gonna say lmao
sos man, she must think really highly of you
dont ask how wow got turned into sos
and i thought you guys were insane
is there a reason a disproportionate amount of bronies are batshit crazy?
aaaaaand grandmas asleep again
not all, but a bunch more than youd expect
i know a bunch who are normal
yeah thats probably a big part of it. also the internet makes people weirder so thats probably a factor
i'm not a mod in eimm
probably won't be tbh
so i'm not exactly the perfect candidate
ida are you sure you dont need a hug
you clearly don't read the graveyard channel
eh, i'm good
like _actually_ mad
oh i remember him
he doesnt count he argued with _everyone_
long gone
gummy that was like two years ago you should probably let it go at some point
i do the same shit i have done for the past 2 years
why not? its like zeal but without any of the annoying people like gummy drago and master
yeah gummy was too insane
even though im right here
actually i haven‚Äôt done anything crazy irl lately
i kind of like this place tbh, it feels pretty chill
zeal is weird
~~ida you didn‚Äôt even wanna join in the first place~~
the people who talk in zeal are just extraordinary enough for me to notice but not enough for me to be alarmed
except rainy
he threaten me to many times
yes flubs?
anyways as for gummyland seems like conversations can start without me but earlier morning and it needs to have right people
im pretty sure rainys actually really nice she just wouldnt be caught dead showing it
yeah she is
but that might be because of the gay agenda
it‚Äôs rare but it has happened
necro?
yeah
because he's donated so much
technically demon lord is the royal treasury im gummyland but he needs to hit the $100k mark
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
won‚Äôt be a long stream but yeah
candyman makes me nervous ngl
just you know more errr
what shall i say it?
explosive?
and probably sexist
and plus if you ban him
yeeeeeah
some jokes i think are okay
sexism and racist jokes aren‚Äôt okay
idk why people want him gone
flubs these arent organized very well on my phone okay
i just checked
he is still banned
but let's not get political
my cou try sucks
they can't ban them though since those tweets will be in the national archives
as crazy as that is but yeah
they can
there would just be consequences
plus jack dorsey apparently is mutual followers with a bunch of white supremecists so it's not like he wants to anyway
and lgbt stuff should not be consider political stuff
ida point to one time in history when that was the case
i feel like that would spark the renaissance faster though
also fuck the romans
imagine if european monarchs in the 900s could order spices on amazon
and spices yum
i don't like spices, i'm white
does yt not realize how long animation takes?
gummy how many youtube channels have you made now?
i have about 5 more
and streaming is worth it
nah man its cool
i am also not banning people who are right unless they do something
we don't need to, i got it handle
gummy the baboon must be studied
so i did it
yeah that's uh
that was your advice drago
flusb
hmm bring sis in to chew him out then ban?
i doubt mods mind someone like that being banned
no not that
```[2:48 pm] dragonite: free speech doesnt mean everybody else doesn't have the right to tell you to shut your pie hole```
i reminded him of that just now
i forgot
send me an invite to this place i want to see this
like time out chair or bad boy corner
no one is seeing this
lol drago
and what even is the whole unmotivated thing as abstruse locution what/
too bad i can't give you the honours to ban
what opponents?
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
to be fair i think he was doing that when gummy muted him but still
like why we drive on parkways and park on driveways
ahahaha
or why it's called taking a dump while you're leaving it behind
turns out
yanis is up
deeo
and frencg
you think that's a lot?
are you sure youre a gummy bear and not a marshmallow? people sure seem hellbent on roasting you
here is a glimpse of people being banned
like theres a 100% chance thats all he has to do today
>keeping you here a bit more because you're calling me "baby"
yanis is great, but hes 15 so expect arrogance from him
ask him if it was a straight pride rally, a milo rally or a kkk rally
i wanna know what a degenerate rally looks like in person but the more bodies show up the better it looks for _them,_ plus i wouldnt be caught dead at a kkk rally
hell yeah, gun control!
there were a few thousand people there who were going "enough is enough" and one guy in the back who was going "nra! nra! nr!"
ironically iceland has a really high guns-per-head ratio
we can stop mass shootings in america by telling all the rednecks that mass is an si unit which pounds technically arent
yeah then they'd just go to - i'm not even going to make that joke it makes me sad just thinking about it
and the people doing mass shootings dont seem like the tolerant type who want a bunch of no good [insert minority] filling up their heaven
holy shit this server has never been this active since last year
if only the churches that are everywhere did psa's like that
dammit i wish i asked the rednose guy that
past tense
this video is wonderful
but i have time now
how you been?
im not ruthless
i know you
i dont hold it against ya :p
but i had to pay car insurance and gas and other stuff ya know soo it took me a bit of saving üòÖ
aren‚Äôt you that guy
i mean i used to play csgo but i had to stop cuz everytime i got headshot and heard that noise i would begin to shake and shitit
i hate saying it
this is a christian server we need more foul language in here
i mean ive had it but like its not like i do it every day xd
wait no thats fowl language
yesh
and make him feel very uncomfortable
nope, changed direction and is going the other way
where in your mouth should your tongue rest?
its still not that bad
good one
perhaps you are approaching this from the wrong angle
this is like the upper atmosphere of flubs
oh by the way you have great taste in profile picture
gyro is my favorite character in all of manga to this day
no one has taken that spot
there are people out there who wont even be thought of a week after their dead and the chance youre one of them is much higher than youd think
honestly there are worse fates
i mean im not even dead yet and gummy already forgot about me
growing numb to pain is the shit my dude
like the fact that golden sun 4 will not be revealed at e3 this year?
i think we might get there
there is no winning against time. your only hope is assimilation
üèì üéæ üèì
oh the i and a are in the opposite order
thats dumb
the next session is scheduled for 4:30 so youd better hurry up
you missed some great quotes
bringina: "local dictator takes a part time job at cafe, villages hope they dont get poisoned"
hes eman
a lot of flubses would be wrong
its the internet youre twelve years old ffs
whats the context even
pretty sure it was you or drago
our opinions are quite similar
"did you rob the gas station?"
"the other guy took more"
also, all i did was ask why theres a d in fridge
theres no d in government
also gummy ask him if it was me or flubs, and if it was tell him that we've been working hard on our shitposting for years and that he can't just walk in and think he can take us on
dont be so harsh on yourself flubs
im not an expert but i understand it. you cook it a bit then munch on it then digest it
who is big brian
i meant big brain
but i dont know what the third one is
kugal don't be ridiculous
thats a bit too much salt
yes they have similar designs
yeah they both have heads
and eyes
thats me when i lose my temper
but i usually flip something
guys
i should play fortnite on youtube just to see how many subscribers i lose
you prob would gain subs
it was _amazing_
that must be a different game
welp
spoilers!
i don't keep up
also the guy who threatened to kill mlp villains is banned for 3 months on manechat flubs
i mean in gummyland
well it is very salty
rather emotional
since you say anything that doesn't seem right and get jumped on
i see
a friend of my mom said i look friendly
i fuckin love just dance
keep in mind im incapable of being serious so probably
leaving zeal
i was only in it for the convienence of not changing my muscle memory but i found a way around it without the random pings
i still play just dance in the og wii
i mean im the one who went through with it so yeah
i‚Äôll sue you flubs
after i make you breakfast
man sis..people that are in eimm are scarier and colder than you
<:wat:579563576914870333>
thats probably what caused the stomach pains
i would like to be alone with the milkshake
demon lord, how big is the sun and moon, not ultra sun and moon aftergame?
alright i‚Äôll see what i can prepare
quick and painful
worst is clearly slow and painful. its not fun
they fuckin dead
lots of guys like that are not nice
plus they werent big on regulations in the 1500s
gummy they have anopheles there
i sense a market niche that needs to be filled
and have a constitutional monarchy
i miss the old dynasty
normally i'd yell at you but that might actually be _less_ suck
no thanks
is that the company discord had a random big investment from?
i watched some of his videos and he seemed a lot less unbiased than he would want one to think
but he's nothing like that now
highly doubt it
this all started with vox and steven crowder
they _can_
they probably wont unless they fire like all of their pr people
they can't censor right leaning people
and hateful stuff
(‚ïØ¬∞–¥¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ /(.‚ñ° . \\)
thats a problem...
we can't get mad at each other anymore
we need to gang up on someone else
though tbh...something about the old camelot days made it seem to be toxic
let's gang up on drago
i do gang up on myself
all in favour of getting rid of some channels/combining them?
i feel like self promotion and media should be combined
i guess media works for him
clear stuff up with stormy and hopefully be able to watch direct with her
yeah
i gotta get up at like 6
prolly flubs then
time to **pun**ish him
mine was worse
are you even trying
screw you
that *smell*
kugal go to bed
blitz stop why beat me up? i was told you were nice over on this server
no puns allowed
regal if you catch kugal being nice you should put him in time-out
you should be
everyone's got the role that lets them screw with stuff
and it was gummy who said y‚Äôall were nice
well i did take hm out on several pizza dates so
kugal why do you have to be such a great person
wow, amazing you'd go out of your way to compliment strangers, props for spreading positivity
well tell them that they did a screwing good job
that is not cute sorry dragon i gay so nude pics of men not my thing
wait what
wish i'd known about that sooner
hell yea
but it gets the job done
no regal we're not contagious i swear!
i think i see a business opportunity
flex tape should fix it
heck yes
dang it's worse than i thought
hamster üòÆ
actually yeah i love weird stuff so
bunnies are **bun**dles of bun and fun, hun
rainy that's okay, you can be as weird as you want as long as you don't be so gosh danged polite as kugal (‚ó°‚Äø‚ó°‚úø)
dang
i dont like you
cus i do
it‚Äôs a puppy dragon
congratulations on finding a computer case that costs more than my entire computer
he half australia shepherd and half golden lab for anyone who wants to know
yes you two he‚Äôs a dog
doggggoooo

all trailers are now in <#563455726048247808>
because you want my money or you want me to talk
how so gummy?
u surprised people bitch about anything
i'm a bit surprised they're delaying it
i knew it will be a big game
if it was a copy paste from new leaf like how city folk was to wild world
but can i do exactly the same thing every day forever?
but i prefer art from oot and mm
nooo regal
i never said zelda games were garbage
i want sword/shield so baddd
new evolution not great but i obsessed with the new legendaries they my kin lol
same
you could ask candyman lol
it's setup as a joke rgal
huh uh
then you have season
then big movie
maybe my game will load? well i guess not
okay i have officially watched drago‚Äôs selling out video
omggg
not that ive seen
i love kiki
flubs you are adopted as well
flubs wtf is this
but i want superman to visit me
and hes one of those shitty ones that stopped caring years ago so youre awkward and they dont even really care
i‚Äôll get err
did someone actually take me?
because im currently having a side effect
trying to
well you might be right flubs
i would have pledged a penny
i know you like hi
nothing much regal
one percent of the time lol
you cant annoy me
he can‚Äôt annoy me trust me
i am immune
other fave sis*
she just can‚Äôt know i choose favourites
thursday is known as my bad luck day
bud tomorrow aint thursday
june 12, and 13 are bad days for me
but the 19th is good
i going to the beach tommorow
cant ur broke like me
that reminds me i still see thelastsane at eyan's streams from time to time
im very broke
thelastsane is crazy
harassed me under anthony‚Äôs orders
yeah
good times
i don‚Äôt like too peaceful
also some cool people
i try not to
black and white good
devent
(i did not just say that because both of my sisters love black and white)
plasma in back and white was cool
btw demon lord tell me again
i asked you this since 2018??
oh you missed the stream today
i had so much audio issues because of stormy
oh yeah i was out probably
sure
stormy likes it and having stormy around is very nice plus i never played those games
but i said colosseum first
theme park world
not sure how much of a zelda fan she is
i remember there was one animal in the original that literally had no eyes
not sure if they were in the later games but yeah, she wouldn't be wrong there
sorry kay kay
showers with short hair are a breeze holy shit
yea ok skarm
skarm you didn't need to share that okay
see the shit we have to deal with?
my backs already destroyed so, come at me bitch
oh ok bye skarm
didnt know you went to school
i mean
i mean, ill give it
always about drago isnt it
drago is leaving, very quickly
threesome?
im tired of your bs skarm
for perspective, that means they dropped from $45.50 to $43.50
that game isn't even all that awesome.
they are there to make money
makes sense, i guess.
your face aint free
you aren‚Äôt free
i didn't feel like installing it anyway
ive had worse
isn't that like super spicy?
flubs i'll buy your channel from you for $400
im a bit jumpy today and will be a lot jumpy tomorrow
charlie is yelling at me becuase i wont give him my friend's number
yes it's 555-5555-555-5-5
thanks i'll just - hey wait the four-digit block is supposed to be the third one, not the second one
oh boy
june 13th
tomorrow?
not thursday lol
every year but last year
he doesnt even remember
i remember him
or shortly before
lmao
due to skullkidfan being in the middle of it
i hear she has resurfaced
gossip amirite
how bout that
i tried making peace with him months ago
he didn't like it
and something about an old friend coming abck
at this point if cuddles doesnt want to talk to anyone that's his problem, the thing you did was like three years ago now
oh i know that drago
he seems..better??
and that the ratings pisses him off
eh idc
"but drago you asked out that one girl from high school four years after graduation"
fricking i hate her after i re read our old msgs
bella's nice
probably
even though she was mad at me one time for not knowing how babies were made
same honesly
i think that stupid crush on bella was what screwed me over
she always said i was like a little brother to her
i will read that book
but yes very weird old days
a lot of drama
i'd dredge up another clip from something i recorded but i dont feel like opening premiere
hey, i wasnt even paying attention, what was that for?
drago i will fight you
with my bare hands
blitz was already punching the shit outta gummy when the gun was shot
who's rob
i see a rob

i only have like five dollars on me

i know a good rob
appreciate it xd
no jk
will smith or wont smith
sleep
coming from him that's basically i love you
what?
no swimming allow here
yes drago les gooooo
i will get lillie bot working skarm
1.1 million
soon enough they'll just re-release old gens as like an "pokemon remastered" or whatever
sleep bye
dont let the bed bugs bite
alright blitzypoo
to the battlefield!
oh good, i have time
muskets
march to the battle
fire!
no one wins because muskets are scarily inaccurate
i do
i play so many games
pour a bit in the pan
i need a detailed step by step process, mla, 12 point font
ram that bullet down
fuck yes
no way
not pour the powder in separately
see the bullet on one end
crazy
this is musket bullet
yea i knew that
and this is what they are stored in
and the circle thing is the bullet
i didnt even know i was hired
am i dreaming?
fine
ive had weird drea,s
too many to count
tbh when are dreams ever normal
caught her with her ball mid yawn
but errr more expensive
thank god
i cant wait for pokemon fork and spoon
well.
but it's only thursday the 13th.
the time i got ban on youtube
that was 2015
someone took control over it
yeah it was no fun
who took control over it?
i wonder if you even know him personally.
i've met the guy a bit
though these days we grew up so it‚Äôs like
‚Äúyoo gummy! everyone say hi to gummy, we met a long time ago when i had 10 subs‚Äù
yea how many subs does he have
i dont think i've ever formally met him but good for him
he‚Äôs cool these days
it'd be different if you badgered him to do it
you don‚Äôt stream
to be fair, to my knowledge, nearly 100% of people in here are your friend lol
that place is haunted for sure
theres fewer people and they are on average better
i just made my profile picture this in honor of pride month
plus i like the colors lol
i see. kek.
but mostly ace
but nope.
yay!
oh really?
pretty much
so you can appear asexual but its just that you only like those you know exceptionally well basically
~~that's kinda gay~~
i had no wifi for like 5 minutes
what i miss?
we're all gay gum
that too
kek.
i wouldn't really want to have sex with a man.
are we human?
sex is the issue here
people went from wanting to get away from me to closer to me
(but honestly i wouldn't have an issue with making out with someone cute, but i would have an issue with bedding them cause that's terrifying)
(the thought of bedding with them is terrifying)
(depends)
(wait, no)
oh finally
needs more beige
my bed has these super bright blue sheets and brown blanket with a grey and white cover blanket and it feels like heaven
i have a habit of oversleepign from how comfy it is
i had to wake up early
of course animal crossing.
i tend to be grumpy during this day
well yeah
minecraft
hell yes
youd rather play minecraft
oh silly gummy, you thought you had a say in this one? no. you shall play minecraft and thats the end of it
stormy's outro today was funny
you and stormy were bickering over what to stream
im just tighter with everyone here
in zeal i almost have nothing to talk about
same
talk to drago, he is there...i think
usually in the original camelot or zeal i say something
blitz do you blow?
i wish
its ok we've been on several pizza dates
alright i'll be back i have doggo chores to take care of
thats good
going for walks is too tiring pretty much
yes but he already knows im in power
though tbh he could overpower me now. dont tell him
benny, wanna lead a revolution?
new pic of him pls
pls don't burn this place down
omg so cuuuuuuute
i dont know if we're ready for that amount of beauty yet
true
plot twist flubs is a girl all along
i see
4 years of me being banned on youtube!!
i had this hung up my wall for a long time
(rest of the server besides flubs and blitz peeks in and says "yup, gummy lost his marbles")
true
the dog or the steak
i have butterbeer
from harry potter
it's basically cream soda with yellow food color
didn‚Äôt work
ida wanna play ffxiv yet
what adultung?
tbh it sounds like a scam
lol it is
oh yea and thats another reason why i like being here so much more
my parents just got home so i get to go hang with them in a bit and kick it live
been busy
later on you start going to a lot of funerals
im cry at my chicken'a funeral
sad sure but not like crying sad
i miss my chicken :(
we have 14 chickens
dont tell my dad though
we will use them for eggs koogul when they grow up
he just got very sick all of a sudden
same with our doggo that one year
she just got so sick one weekend and it was time
u watch stephenplays? i knew i liked you
it's great if you enjoy him, i'm just giving my opinion that's all
i hope that wasn't serious
regal isn‚Äôt trust me
all right
i'm sure a lot of stephen's fans are quite passionate about him
great i rewatched the memento mori and now i really miss my chicken :(
water or grass pok√©mon?
grass
e!game spaghetti
same
also how many people have asked you what but'i means so far
good
prob asleep
mine is horrid
so ida lives in iceland and operates on new york time, and drago lives in new york time and operates on california time
he‚Äôll still be on the game
you don‚Äôt play that game
guys guys
pizza and wings
oh there will be
oh shit i just got it
i finally did it. i figured something out that wasnt completely obvious
i didnt know those wrist bands that absorb sweat are supposed to be used so you have em on your wrist so you can wipe your forehead until some tweet pointed it out
nice to hear you found someone gummy
not that kind
"it sucks and i hate it"
your face is a drago opinion on twitter
your pokemon thing
too many pokemon anyways
i mean, duh
hey man no declaring war on the flubs
i will shoot you. no invading flubs for resources
what are you gonna do? sic benny on me?
well im also hungry and need more food
youre the one that lives here
i found a new favorite ice cream flavor
can i have some?
new favorite flavor
nani
i should be studying but im playing pokemon
was wondering if you were up for league?
yeah.
i take it you guys are watching mlp together
ah lol
tbh flubs would like it
it's great
doesn't seem very biologically accurate
my brother was a big fan of tmnt way back
one of the best animated tv shows i've seen.
i like the 1987 version as well
exactly
that was a good one
lol that was reference in the lego batman movie
t!top
why are the kids in eggs
or flubsology
flubsology is the study of flubses. thats a horrible field
od horribly
ergo ily
which are made of math
math is math!
dragonite dont insult my absurdly large body
im not doing anything gross lol
i promise
i dont have one but i love it, i used to play one one of my friends all the time
lol yeah i remember first playing that game with my cousins
for yellee
there's charlie for ya
is probably one of the best mod choices i made
doesn‚Äôt care if you are a friend or not, when rules are broken he is strict about it
wtf how am i 6th?
yanis is a good mod. he silences people and thats funny
drago is very consistent. very consistently weird.
ah, will added it. forgot she liked it.
fuck, ive been found out
that's
he leaves it on a table and pokes the screen
phones aren‚Äôt that heavy
are the stories referring to the same event?
the comments were very acab
hi, gummy!
its reddit's two ideologies, both of which are annoying as shit and very reductive
all cops are bad and all conservatives are bad
hi star
so reddit and news are bad
even though it‚Äôs not against the rules
kek.
i only allow game news tbh
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115> <:revolver:582671595235966976>
black and white instead of trying to do that soft reboot should have picked only a hand full of popular pokemon from past gens
nah most gens you can find plenty of pokemon or trade
when the game comes out itll be fun and most people wont give a shit that theres only some pokemon in it
like pikachu
flat out
no fucking way in hell they should have tried that
probably however
transfer i believe is gone
would you pay for something like that?
"in the newest zelda game, link will be paid dlc released 6 months after launch"
btw idk about you
botw has such a nice art style
it's my favourite game?
the only way botwo could be bad is if it relies too much on motion controls
i liked ss with motion controls
imo its ok if its an option not mandatory
speaking of which i should probably open my bday present from you soon
i got things to do today
welp my youtube was left on for four hours with no one home
im still streaming
nice
i watched but whenever i tried to type my keyboard would glitch and only really rude and accurate things about your gameplay would come out
strange
lol flubs btw there was a crazy hippie at the beach the other day
i wanna be his friend
or girl
inappropriate? thats my kind of music
he also had a crazy husky dog which was super aggressive and it was p-u-s-s-y
it was also named dracula or something close to that
someone with multiple hips
im playing zoe
nah man im asleep
noooo
sounds rad
sorry doggo borked
i'll listen and lurk though üëÄ
kugal quit it with the niceness its hurting my feelings
sounds fun
thats ok flubs, i stilll love you
gummy is actually trying to talk me to death
gummy
i just broke my chair
üòè sexy
i pushed down on an arm rest and it completely disconnected. ill be right back
well shit
nothing you could ever eat tastes as good as being healthy feels, but eating tastes good now and health feels good in 6 months - 10 years
me too, if i eat fast food i have bad poopoos
its the worst
gumym
gummy youre so smart it scares me
you should probably dont
accurate though, demon
yeah he barks often its just quiet and high pitched
probably doesnt lool
teach that dog the word of the lord kugal
its too much of a coincidence between all of the cultures that they all predict an afterlife for there not to be something
what if all the afterlives are mixed together into one big one, but you need to meet all the criteria to get it?
so everyone goes to hell since most religions need you to be of their religion to get into their heaven
all the gods are in a really big proxy war with their followers as puppet states
that was my dad lmao
if the two gods are equal gummy, that means i have all the power of humanity - one weird crippled guy
am not religious but take me to church is one of me favorite songs
dont need to be religious to be unhappy tho üòé
even 20 years ago it would've been social suicide to say something like that
hell, all of us could be wrong, it could be something none of us can fathom
im intrigued
im not fully sold but ill try it
why die tho
ok done with my duolingo
i would vouch for it
you were pretty deep in the closet, you said to me that same thing one time, that being gay is bad
im pretty comfortable with my sexuality, im straight but bi curious ish i guess
go ahead
i dont think you should sterotype voices lol
im gonna head to bed fellas, have a good night
in vc
if you can das fine lol
hello i just got 11 hours of sleep
welcome to my world
you and me are like you and my sister, since we fight over nonsense most of the time, and ida's like my brother, who's usually looking on and going what the crap is wrong with you two
i will call sis to protect me from you
oh true
i'm 100% slavic.
flubs i will sue you
does this mean you will catch up on mlp?
i do that in bed silly
besides i can only go thru season 8 on netflix i think
i bad at movies i try to finish it tonight maybe
ida i meant regal
whoops
can i be your third sister?
aren‚Äôt you a boy anyway koogul
maybe
as long as it involves math
what was the other core subject
im a boy, got the xy
if i could find a mate who was also a math boi i would die
will do drago
oh well that's good
good!
i too anti social for the pride parades lol
will
he's upping the pressure on me to get a girlfriend
you nerd
lol xd
there are only a few things i can think of to respond to that and they're all terrible
tell him that you agree and think you should be enrolled in more math classes
i like it
same lol ^w^
ive been thinking about what mine should be after dan
the glasses help
i feel more photo genic with my new fab haircut
das right
üòÆ aw shoot man
flubs more like fabs
ok help me here
it's almost the 204th year anniversary of the battle of waterloo
it's almost the third anniversary of the first time gummy disappointed me
no it isn't
there's a whole day to go
sure drago
they do make some exceptions to those rules
so i have a game that i play for eight hours 3years ago and now i can‚Äôt find it? okay steam sure
theres a chance it was removed from steam
im pretty sure when that happens the game poofs out of existence
interesting
great well least it was free
das good
at least i'll be making moola
with a different background colour
what do you recommend?
too much purple
purple is one of the best colors, though.
leave it the way it was.
still...
but if you want it that way then keep it becuase that's just my dumb opinion lmao
pink for sylveon
yeah
shhh
no stay dead
they watch
its ok if kids watch they'll be too pure to understand
oh yeah
there
she said "hmm" is not funny enough
iron_female
some variation of mine could be cool
it‚Äôs actually a real thing
so what if others can see my nipples?
that's what she typed in anyway
because chemistry and biology
kugal shut up you would have done the same
rip my headphones they died
i meant hard to take care of
perfect
hey drago's sister
that's like asking a rock to be a rock
are you calling me a pot head
well i got news for you
you look stoned
drago 1, drago 0
then we can make a meme lke "who would win? one weird dragon or one koogally boi"
if kugal taped puppet eyes to his face would he be a googaley koogally?
i would hold a calculus text book like youre holdin a skyrim book
but i dont know if i actually own a trash can lid
also gummy
maybe it is not us who is stoned, but gummy who is stoned
lol xd
how did you get your dog to hold a guitar like that
why not?
stone
he's as tall as a skyscraper if not taller lol xd
i could probably murder someone with it in combat
guys charlie is sleeping right now and it's cute
i should go outside and pet bunny
even though it is one in the morning and bunny is probably sleep
pupper üíñ
seems like starlight is one of the few people who like the informative style that i do
unless you are chugga who shouts
shouting is fine to an extent
and swearing..welll
it‚Äôs really bad that my server is one of the better ones out there
huge example one guy kept giving ownership to random people and getting it back then one day he lost it and got kicked
made a new server and did it again
now has a brand new server
benny who
he's on first
well no hes an independent being
my favourite lec victory music
kinky.
you are ambassador to gummyland here
demon lord
they lied to me
but yeah sorry to hear that
floral is the one who i like to call the cute little ball of anger
im angry as well
*thank* you
but story goes deeper
floral who knows tb is crazy
benny can be the cute little mop of anger
turns out
tb doesn‚Äôt like sex when being asked
but she broke up with him since he said no to sex
isnt not liking sex when asked just the definition of liking sexual assault
get a room
also since i wrote that i can never become the president of the united states
thonk
yes, im in control. haha of course
so ask benny what he wants to add to this server?
he said nothing but he glared at me
maybe he is mad at the cats in the server
it just broke
good good
whyy
kugal stop howling at your dog
but he likes being howled at!
ive installed this app that my sister told me about that connects you to lgbt people and ive already got this 15 year old guy asking if we can be bfs lmao
ok this dude just asked if i have a big butt
but it'
also i had a dream that someone that got banned from gummyland just recently snuck in here and caused trouble
it wasnt a dream, that how i spent my morning
well class is cancel and i wanna stream but i can't since parents are here
sure
how is your booty?
quite luscious and ready for display
well flubs just buy me a drink first
ok thank you
i mean if a nuclear war was gonna start its probably pakistan and india but besides that and the class imbalance its great
president flubs
went to specialist to learn i just need more fiber
go ahead
damn
gummy knock it off
just finished the best game of bf4 ive ever played, 34-22
im pretty proud of myself
dont worry i deleted the app again
people are so interesting in their ways
he also asked about something else after asking about my bum bum that made me go "yep definitely delete app"
he asked about your day. the sick freak
i know right
oh no
their singing was cringy
if i was there it would've been a lot better
i can legally drink guys
that shit is disgusting
haaaapppyy biirthday tooooo youuuu
aww gummy, doesnt that just make you smile? (:
haaaapppppyyyy biiiiirrrthhhhdaayyy deeaarr guuummmyyyyy
haaapppyyy birthhdaaay toooo youuuuuuu
that was bootiful
then again, smile more, it looks good on you üòâ
thanks for the idea kugal
no singing on my bday pls
okay gummy fine you can have a happy birthday. but not too happy.
gummy you can have seventeed hours of happiness but after that it's $4.99 an hour
thanks sis and drago
it‚Äôs rain!!!
when taking pictures like this
you are 22 and im 19
and now we are both legal to drink in canada..
still
gummy i challenge you to an orange juice chugging competition
you should probably surrender now
apple juice pls
gummy
alright how about soda pop then?
<:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132> <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
yeah
so they dont want to moderate pretty much
they never see the positive that i see
hes like a young ida
thing is
okay i apologized to them
youre a bad judge of character
gummy you should hire me. i'm the best in my class at not listening.
dang
hes gone
right now drago
what else is new
for you yeah
just got my new phone woo
im sorry for roasting you ida
moooo
wait, no, they already made dumb n dumber
blacking out is sleep mode and passing out is turning it off and back on again
true
though they said i cannot take criticism
they have a point
like if i tell you that your servers economic policy is backwards and rooted in your personal bias, thats good advice. if i tell you to be taller because you look like a troll at your current height, thats bad advice
gummy theyre nerds ignore their feelings
just imagine. then you wouldnt have to deal with tb _or_ floral!
no i'm haunting his dreams until he dies
or that one fellow who has been mighty strange lately
hes *always* a massive twat
im so happy im on a new phone on a new plan
that probably always ended well
get your dad arrested for possession of cp
top ten pranks
it was just a prank bro calm down lol *dab*
i made a person laugh
damn thats a good pup
im offering free hugs to all
i did it
nothing
a nonexistent price to pay for salvation
anyone care to join?
ok üò¶
but when i stream animal crossing, all a sudden new viewers join and talk
and beat them with nets
implying my room has a lock
wait coke as in coca cola? or err.... cocaine?
only to be replaced by yanis
yeah
haters gon' hate hate hate hate hate
anyone who joins now will automatically get a role where they cannot embed links nor post pictures
now we're going to be back to the pre-2012 youtube spam.
hey you should all visit (remove the spaces)
freebuttz .com
for free buttz
a person who is called flippy keeps coming back with alts of the same name
gummy i am in need of free butts. mine has sprung a leak and i won't be able to sit down again until i can replace it.
i don‚Äôt get why zeal isn‚Äôt raided as much?
link is public
i thought you did drago
discord me is open
plus link is in the description of eyan‚Äôs videos
drago i only have burritos
you gotta fight benny for it
we should meditate on butts
be patient i was dropped on my head as an infant
this is an acceptable substitute for tacos, thank you
i expect it to be delivered before yesterday at noon
fucking drinking i thought would be cool
beer is great but pure alcohol is far better
it's not tasty for me.
nah i mean itd probably destroy your mouth throat stomach and intestines
that's what alcohol does.
also the withdrawls can kill you
alcohol is added in beer
drink with me drago
i don't need any more problems with my health, really..
but if you aren't, you're pretty sane.
gummy i think it's past your bedtime
<:wat:579563576914870333>
and a geek
and all you have to do to move around in 3d space is multiply your current matrix with your updated transformation matrix!
im bored
it's raining
just talked with my dad for like an hr so that was something
flubs are you wet?
how fun
either way i thought it look so good
though mine will be bigger...so $500?
nocturnal emissions are fun
i personally would only spend that much money on something that i would use for a long time
hmmm prob should find an artist for sis's gift
i talked on the phone for an hr and 13 minutes
and that drained 7% of the battery
wow dude how could you
then their products sucked
now to stream animal crossing
wiat
because its fabulous
just some douche
he looks like el=vis
thats me lmao
it only has like 510 cameras
but yeah that'll be a bit later, gotta do a few things right now lol
i forgot what was it
oooh dayum
sure
haha nice
kugal dont encourage him
oh ok
gummy why i thought getting trolled was fun
here is the thing
it should.
well star accidents do happen
as for floral...she keeps going back and forth on dating tb or not
this is like the most entertainment i had in years
ask them if they would like to collect tips
he's also older than me.
but i'm older than gummy.
wait i actually need flubs
you will see embarrassing deaths
too bad
so flubs im going to steak place on monday
here is a menu sample
get either the prime rib or new york those sound yummy
and i just had new york strip on my bday
"steak"
mine!
here eat the lasagna
bitch lasagna
except for ham it doesnt look bad
drago, what do you have against ham?
i've been eaten.
oh yeah the bot does that
ham is good
which i guess encompasses most pork
silly gummy died lol
but like ham and actual expensive pork is just blah
thats pork right?
lets see only 8 wings
skarm gets two
i forgot he existed
shhh
who needs alcohol...when you got this
drago doesn‚Äôt get one
it's his favorite reason.
because he knows i'd haunt him until he dies
haunt his ghost lol
i need sis protection!
drago...no giving her ideas
nooo
doggo.
"keep the stupid deaths cummin gum"
not yet
gummy you missed the coin
then kill it
gummy keeps dying like a silly pants
thonk
didnt you just turn like 18
im 19
when i did that stuff i was 16/17
til im a terrible friend
i give dragos 1.1
i should have known that emile would get me to replay it xd
i had the best league game ever
code blue
you know
the reason why i like you more is...you didn‚Äôt give me a death card for my bday
i didn‚Äôt know fluttershy had a horn
thats gotta be a violation of something
gummy wanna do my homework for me
she sounds proud
she is one of a kidn
you already have no pride.
eew get it off my screen
i meant dragonair
you and me both
im hungry
how fun
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
oh i need to add you as a friend
which server are you on? if you're logged in you should see it above the minimap.
i think it was the one you said you were on
feeling a tickle on your face and then wiping that spot with your hand to see it was an ant
becuase that sounds fun
what level are you btw drago?
done fuck all, have you?
you know i've got 3 alts i've not played on, could play along with you or something sometime
no that's race
no, it's subscription based
i see
it just doesn't let you level past 35
khajiit has wares, if you has the coin
tiberia prima, same as role play alt because im not creative enough to think of a second fake name
i seem to be able to stream in hd without lag...
you died gummy
except my youtube that goes to flubs
yay i disconnected
there should be a quest marker on your minimap
i feel bad for saying i would play even though i haven't yet
sorry sis..
gummy how dare you not play video games
i just haven't gotten the time or commitment
there something about a main scenario quest in the corner
hooray im competent
this is where i nod and pretend i did it on purpose
i also happen to be following you around
oh is that you
is that going to get me killed
but the help prompts should still pop up
oh cool i hav ea fire thing
awesome, i died
just need better gear than what you start with
lemme see if i can figure out how to put it on
wow your connection to the server is worse than mine
starting like two days ago
or the other way around
the game doesn't realize i'm disconnected
like i can still walk around and stuff
the first dungeon is unlocked at the level 15 main story quest
i see
i will catch up when i have time
kugal is being generous with his pizza
just got done stuffing my face
sure
same
btw kugal have you heard rainy's voice on stream yet?
i've been a busy boi so attending streams has been kinda hard
i gave up on zeal i think
yeah i'm still a mod on stream but i left the server too
well if he by some miracle starts making youtube videos again maybe i‚Äôll watch
then the jerks took over
wow jerks amirite
i love streams but i would them a lot if i didnt have a fuckin clue about how the games he played worked lmao
wow i can talk
much yes
i hate to admit it because i love the guy but it's kind of true
i still like the streams though
not because he wanted to be entertaining
he has with me anyway
but i enjoy watching league most of the time
i barely even understand that game sadly enough
it is
my mom got me these chocolates where its these dark chocolates filled with caramel and its so yummy
ah rip
5 sec delay
feel like shit
but you can even feel like shit when you stream!
nash
for stream i can
grandma says i'm a bad boy
we get along really well
got my new external harddrive set up
nice
maybe you could partition the 8 tb one a few times
this is not newsworthy
no it wasn‚Äôt
the idea is so innocent and cute
and terrible because fiften year old drago sucked
well pokefusion is trending on twitter and it‚Äôs terrifying
problem is..i don‚Äôt remember
im going to go out on a limb and guess that it was to treat my channel like a business and not go "ehh i like making videos i guess"
me either
im not even trying to now
gummy did you see my selling out video
nice
it's actually not, space is far too empty for there to be any reasonable chance of a direct hit from anything
plus that's like the 500,000,000 year forecast
yeah the universe is big and empty
well at least it's probable that people will land on mars in our lifetimes
i believe my mom was still a teenager when we landed on the moon
have you even seen twitter?
see? qed, fools!
just had a very successful stream
ida misspelled it
i would die, but yes i do scream
well in terms of viewers
due to respect for eyan
i don‚Äôt take his viewers
well animal man showed up today
point is something something honour something
besides would i like it if someone self promotes in gummyland...*realizes he encourages that there*
fuck my logic
don‚Äôt encourage this...
regal you should have permissions to screw with roles and stuff if you get bored
i mean uh
i gave you the purple i guess role
gummy can't kill you if you kill him first
she just has to overkill him
helllp flubs
dont worry youll be fine
bye gummy, nice knowing you
also that would cause me to lose all my data and stuff
sleep
well if your parents are bipedal and have arms, that probably means they're of the homo genus
sis sleep
i wish
both you are sis
no you smart
hey that was me last night
lucky you
i'll wake up at 6 pm
i feel bad for going to bed cause my hound won‚Äôt share but i have headache
well i going to try to go to bed now hopefully dogs are good
no i need to go to sleep
if i strangle you but only partially you might pass out
not a fan of a method that may induce brain damage
what about mathematical hugs
mathematical hugs are just as great
the ratio of the average cross-sectional distance and the perimeter of your arms is pi
nooooo!
nooo i missed sis being drunk
they are kinda nice...
and then i had work
yay...aww
~~twitch streaming with gummy can be a job~~
retail sucks though
or the delivery guy doesn‚Äôt steal my medical stuff or whatever happened to my last order
im looking for an artist
if not then i‚Äôll sign tonight
did you remove the punctuation?
the space
and a certain person should know what im doing
he wants porn
lies
flubs i know what you did
(sarcasm) lets get sis porn for her bday, she certainly won‚Äôt disown me and kill me
that would be inefficient
screw you
meow
why did you put ida in a box
i want both.
so it would be basically too tempting to use on gummy.
you can also kill people with a shield if you know how to use it
it was doctor drago in the conservatory with the hylian shield
wow you revel
no drago
at least according to my friends list
i don‚Äôt want any more zeal connections
nothing screams fancy like deep fried potato
how much alcohol have you had and how much did you eat before that
i feel a light buzz
>"kiddies"
it means your blood alcohol content is too low
red face is because alcohol restricts the blood flow to your not important parts
all your blood streets tighten up or whatever
keep doing it and youre one step closer to a sclerosis related death :\)
thanks flubs
this is this the shot i tried
my sister had scoliosis
now time to hide my celebration drinking activities from sis
borrow drago‚Äôs microwave
make it 65
and i‚Äôll buy it off you
gummy
yeah thats a fun way to say hello
only if its scalding
omg popeyes is yummy
thank god i don
or rarely
gummy you should stream game dev
i'd pay to see the game design tools they used to make mario galaxy, too
and no drago
that is?
they told me online
it‚Äôs all online mow
that's odd.
yeah even simple places like mcdonald‚Äôs
in poland you can do face-to-face normally.
they told me they aren‚Äôt hiring right mow tho
but consider me
but yeah...walmart probably need to apply online
goddamn enforcement of online applications for jobs.
which i hear is terrible to work at
me too
and far places that i can‚Äôt get to easily
also if i start thinking about twitch streaming as a job it will get to my head
you mean you'll get addicted?
yeah..
streaming
howdy doodles poodles
asking for some....reasons
asking which one you should play?
also ida
neat
it's about accurate too
ah yes
big balls for someone who pissed on the couch earlier today
the screenshot?
you know my final walkthrough plans?
but im gonna do...
sure drago
bios?
stormy will just tell me what to say
we just finished
turns out
she sort of likes me the most
that's good to hear.
the thing you are gonna give me
woah
i dont know if it actually saved me any time but it was fun to make right?
because it sounds funny
that sounds like a place where people go when their shoelaces are untied
who runs this server btw?
and i guess skarm
give me ownership
i gave it back.
yeah star
i'll proceed to transfer ownership to an alt who's attached to a ten minute mail with a jibberish password that i won't be able to recover
all right, then.
sounds like some nice entertainment.
which led them both to be suspended in mlp support group as mods
floral's ex
but not about his ex.
but floral broke up with tb and went with his ex
play ffxiv?
when i have time
i paid $200 for that
we have a problem
we need someone to stir up trouble
necro or candyman anyone?
what about noponz
i think if he does do youtube it shouldnt be anything too ambitious or he might fall into that hole again of coming back at full power and then have no energy after a week
oh i thought you did
for me it would be opposite
and i learnt so much now
but fuck let's plays
i should do a let's learn
your health is important
it's a dnd joke but i think you might like it for the angry bun
idk what to think about it...
i meant in gummyland
you have weird dreams
i want to be a game developer. i have weirder dreams.
she has like high white socks
i like high white socks.
oops, just killed half the universe.
but we discussed about getting back together in the future
though if i get this job
which means i may be able to work on youtube and get that done instead
would you be working on youtube stuff while at work?
go to walmart
im excited though demon lord surprisingly
they were white drago
probably redo nsmb 3
videos will remain the same
just with new overlay
hey gummy do you ahve a big fat spreadsheet of your youtube stuff?
might just re-record everything tbh
i see
maybe strawberry
nice nice
hai friends ^w^
ah rip lol
i went through another youtube crisis
so im restarting again
oh boy
that too
game reviews aren‚Äôt me
that's what eyan has wanted to do for a long time
what i wanted to do for a long time
im probably not gonna refilm
too much work to refilm
are you dead?
yeah idk man maybe my soul is shutting down
flubs i just want you to knowi
or shpuld that be the other way around
don't die
thonk
im still worthy!
im restarting nsmb 2
a soft restart
just different overlay
so i get double the deaths!
ive had 2 wrong numbers call/text me today
hound dogs are the best
doggo
ha i did tell everyone my pony influences help
influences what?
they influence our friendship i guess
alright you passed your drug test but you tread lightly
(yes really)
lmao
skarm stop mocking will
wow that is a long time
100% worth it though
trying to get my caregiver to text me wats in the food she left me cause it looks like beef and i don‚Äôt eat beef
yeah thats gangstery lol
for rarity it should be "darling i know u love me"
apparently not
i would say alcohol but that never helps
rubbing alcohol?
i was thinking methanol but sure
yeah it‚Äôs a pain but there worth it ofc i have the new 2ds xl so i dunno about regular
and i don‚Äôt think i butchered it that bad
"i butchered it but not that badly" is what i heard
now those strangers will know im smarter than them
‚Äúdo you do outdoor activities‚Äù
well you still are
well interview..i can't fuck that up
you can though
in fact ts real easy
not final fantasy
oh cool it's updating that's fun
not for cheap people like me i assume
come on update faster ·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
i have to sit
oh a dragon just got stuck in it somehow
flubs can i walk benny today?
no. my dog. go away
ida am i allowed to play as a dragon in this game
like sonic
july 12 is important guys
drago it‚Äôs also almost 3 years of knowing each other
i know
17-20
who‚Äôs following who?
not me.
no one told me the 2ds xl needed that
whats up gang
kugal play ffxiv
i got a job interview
a really edgy bunny lady
or a lion man
but im procrastinating those as usual
er, exactly how does this "cast interrupted" thing work
remind me, do i _need_ to do the main quest before i can play with friends or can i do random side stuff until i get to level whatever?
sometimes damage interrupts if it's severe enough
or a silence even
sword has a dark souls boss in it lmao
yay.
hey some advice from adults needed
also don't let them make you feel guilty either
you are entitled to your own time
i happen to know a thing or two about that from my own father
no it‚Äôs not broken
that happened with my first 3ds
one of the shoulder buttons would stick
death peak in chrono trigger comes to mind
i'm good at taking care of my stuff i swear
drago stop breaking things
should you? yes. legally? no. will you? yes again
<:thonking:562120028493709321>
i got $65 gamestop credit
can i have it>
flubs can i have it
we'd never do such a thing
oh okay
wait why are these the sealed grounds now
i think will might still be stuck down there actually
im sad
3ds and charger
oh so you smack it on there and it charges it without annoying wires in the way?
the dock needs to be plugged in too
well we already knew i was weird but now we know gummys 3ds peripherals are weird too
fucking on thing i hate about 2ds xl and where you insert your game
it‚Äôs stupid and i scratch the cover trying to get it open
sure
any vc with gummy is a cool vc
then we can
drago you won‚Äôt like beans and shrimp
yeah how could he like two good foods put together
drago hitting us with the absolute hot takes
bad food doesnt taste good
i have one about perl that i havent read more than about three pages of becuase it turns out that perl sucks
let's see my self is currently:
30% one piece
30% potter and potter-related media
30% programming
10% whatever other junk i wanted to get off the floor
do you normally get stranded in places?
so lets say 11:30
go to sleep
good night
maybe 20
alright
be weary
oh no then i can't have him, mom wants clean carpets
weary is probably the worst named emote of them all
ah yes the single most confusing show to explain to someone who walks in
"no mom it isnt porn, theyre *cooking!*"
theyre making a fourth season this fall
im very excited
you could wait, idk the last season ends kinda abruptly so that might be better
so start rewatching the first 73 episodes of bleach got it
~~hey bunni gummy said im better than you~~
night
bye bye haha
i tried sleeping but my blood sugar felt low so im all shaky and weird waiting for this ice cream to soften so i can eat it
swipes at dragon
nope no speak that language
hopefully it gets fixed because games acting weird isnt inherently fun, especially when you dont want them to lul
no the mouse is acting up great i love games i really do
oh crap
and now i having another issue let‚Äôs see if reinstalling works
cause i don‚Äôt use mods so i dunno what the problem is
i fell asleep
uk that‚Äôs not exactly that far off from some of my dreams
welp
broken champs are broken
my dad is disappointed in me becuase me and one of my female friends havent indulged in anything nsfw together
no lit would be covering yourself in gasoline and jumping into a fireplace
hang on
yea me too
you trickster
but you don't want to sword fight your non-romantic lady friends becasue thatd be too dangerous
he wont be disappointed in me any longer
i mean
did i say that
duolingo has mommy issues
do nsfw stuff
yes but only when youre prepared
need safety
can never be too careful, man
i know
i've heard some interesting stories about grindr on r/gaybros
the gay reddit subs have such original names
dad: you gotta show me how around grindr
simon: dad what do you think grindr is?
dad: it's like facebook, right? for gay people?
no not in the good way
an antirockstar
yup lmao
lpt: lots of people in the exact same situation at christian events
guys my barber might be santa claus
i wanna play with you
any peeps alive
ida do i want to know
and someone had left a light pole in the middle of the walkway
feel alright besides the dry blood on the side of my head
pls be safe
ask drago about that
i not i just really confused
right now i am arguing over forms of government
i watched it like
booo
well i couldnt watch it the minute it came out!
well
wrong
this was the first world war
see?
yes star
they never called it world war 1 or anything
gummy!
fight me flubs
doesnt seem fair but sure
he wont have the courage to fight back
charlie is a wuss
but he acts tough
and he looks tough
wow charlie is the opposite of benny. benny is cute and sweet looking but will murder you while charlie looks tough but is really sweet
benny vs charlie pls
she will
<:hanssip:562472347823505410>
yeah right now i have to protect her until she can protect me again
also i never responded to league but okay
gummy you're already gold in my eyes
it got real quiet real fast
yeah
omg you adulting!!
kinda
im constantly in a weird mood
it‚Äôs a gay thing probably
journey was a band we didn‚Äôt deserve
just a small town girl
she took the midnight train goin anywhere
being gay is the only thing you should be doing
their shadows searching in the night
im gonna go have dinner peeps
flubs im ignoring you
well i don‚Äôt want rice and other stuff keeps messing up
alright gang
damn kugal the fuck happened at dinner
dammit
tomorrow isnt pride month anymore
lmao dont do that
misclick
also no kugal
it's dangeous to hold such power for extended periods of time
what hes saying is that now you have to be *really* homophobic for the next 30 days
flubs that made me laugh way too hard
but that's what his dad spent all month doing
but westboro baptist hates everyone so when he's done with that kugal would have to unconditionally love everyo - wait crap
tell me hopw fabulous they look
lmfao
no offense gum
im always doing something gay
the gayest
kugal i dont think your dad thinks youre gay enough
oh yea he doesnt
no do the first one. you need to ease him into it.
ah right right
nope i done i try to be worry about hamster after she gets her nose stuck she escapes again
dang hamster
nighty night
a lot of gay shit
that would be a crime against the universe
discord thanks for delivering my messags on time
there's more compliments where that came from
i have to kiss a guy
ew boobs
shit he went to bed
how are you?
hanging with stormy
surprisingly she ain‚Äôt mad for what happened last night
hmm my throwback
phone super user kill streak?
in my case
lmao
only person who has like little personality change is like demon lord
drago you never beat me up in the past
how can you throw a car, if you're so small a mini car is taller than you.
my knee hurts and i blame gummy
i know
did you delete your nsmb2 walkthrough?
gonna reupload them
oh thank god
right now im having trouble with it though
i should
yo deber√≠a
turns out kiera uses poke balls as well to catch legendaries
without watching eyan
i apparently have the number of maria now
because i've received 3 wrong number calls/texts for maria
dammit maria!
she's almost as gay as kugal!
sis‚Äôs name is mordred
blitz is err 72
wouldn't she prefer less dread, though?
no thats your name
thats a cool ass name ngl
or make something up for fun
kugal you're a builder and worker in stone.
*a wat*
gummy you were named after my middle name
gummy your name is officially "mr bumbledink"
i actually probably know most people‚Äôs actual names here
let me count
he knows my full name.
11-13
reason why i say 13 since i think i know vortex and animal man‚Äôs names
you have rainy‚Äôs name regal
it‚Äôs just spelt differently
like the christmas kind
there was an incident on ss forums where someone accidentally guessed my last name by shipping me with another user named "lord penguin"
if you hosted a conference about vocabulary would it then be called a "lexicon?"
or fen but no one in real world calls me that
well outside of d and d but haven‚Äôt played in forever
i guess sis‚Äôs name
bad dragon bad dragon
oh hey we talked about this yesterday
hey i put work into that one okay
i hate puns but im willing to make them if it means someone will get upset
it's reading that you're -84673118843 now

they were never this weird in zeal
yay peanut butter
only if you birng the ice cream
regal's bringing ice cream
vanilla

damn dude way to flex on us
but thats it i swear
darn.
demon lord
wow lol

god shit on the kaiser!
so i got up and said "at least i fell fabulously" and z snapped
my friend was fucking dead

skarm start singing
skarm sing
my turn to sing
and you say you never sing.
its fun
im telling people stories today
uuuuuuuh
(‚ïØ¬∞–¥¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ /(.‚ñ° . \\)
i vaguely remember the matrix math i did on my own accord a year ago
i do already have code to turn world space to screen space and vice versa but it's for a perspective projection and not an orthographic one
so demon lord, even when bleep this might happen
tbh i don't think swearing should be a big deal
i solemnly swear that i am up to no good
i would never listen to youtube
but after a while who cares
yea i dont really swear in front of people i dont know well
darn drago
mostly anyway i'll tell gummy "what the crap" and stuff but that's about it
i wonder if charlie swears
what war crimes could i have committed?
you nuke pluto
and he likes pluto
ooooooh ok
my god
that you dont know what youre doing>?
gambling is dumb
i rather go to an interesting place
my dad goes gambling every now and again and every time i swear he wins like 2 grand
pc, xbox, playstation, and nintendo switch
a fortnite one currently
they have league, im thinking of scouting it out to see how good their pc is
guys help me charlie is going mad
can i have him
sis! you look cool
ida why are you awake
i'm going to sleep now cya
ah nver mind
animalmamansmans
kewgal
i need someone
i will prob just use the sylveon head
i saw that in theatres
no one stayed for the credits but me
have i told you youre great???
no hugs for drago apparently
henlo
vortex!!
hugs gummy
if anything this is my favorite server to talk in
and this is gayer
with the smaller
the bot says otherwise.
oh. i am glad we met, then. it's nice when people know what you mean.
lmao
therefore gummyland now belongs to her
i don't want it
im his biggest fan
let me know if he‚Äôs like a good neighbor
since 2014
nintendo stocks pls
i better sell before then
how you know amazon was my second choice?
i hqve my sources
oh yea true üò¶
has he?
you usually do something super gay to cheer me up
lmaooo
today kugal didnt have time to do gay stuff
he had to adult and get his bank account situated
if you dream about sexy men it dont count, its only if you'd act on it irl üòâ
i envy that tho, i never see sexy men in my dreams
ida why you do this to me
all the guys in that last picture are the same guy
omg i was almost stuck on emoji keyboard
crap im being nice to people in front of drago
aww how sweet of you
becaise i do t
it's ok he just needs more time in the kissing booth
yeah, sounds good
i'll offer free hugs though
this is confusing
wait you are above age right
i remember when you were like 14 yeesh
dang you younger than gummy whoops sry i thought you were older
that's fine i get it more than you think lol
yeah people think i older or something or they used to
i turn 18 this december
yeah totally didn‚Äôt mean to hit on you kugal
kugal and master are both just perpetually high schoolers i think
are you thinking of panda? he's also gay and fabulous and way older than i lol
i don‚Äôt remember i just know whoever was getting stuck in their basement all the time
hmmmm
kugal in a blitz
ida your special gift will be delayed...
what he said
and maybe not for years
i thought you just has changed and weren‚Äôt getting stuck in the basement anymore
if anything
i should at least get up and changed but i don‚Äôt want to
no rule that says i have to stay up right
kugal you're adopted
sry if tmi i have weird social borders
for example he cant stop shouting how gay he is
regal kugal and i just spent all of last night in the kissing booth i think youre going to have to try a little harder if you want to achieve tmi
regal was decidedly not in the kissing booth with us
i mean, im not even gay, i just like making things weird, and saving it for later would be the antithesis of making things weird
kugal do you know any cute single dragon girls?
i know that feeling all too well having been raised by a single mother
that's good, dont need all of that toxicity
bb in a few minutes you guys are cheering me up
ask him if he prefers carbon, potassium or uranium
i mean, not nice but
there was one time when my dad got upset with me over not wanting to get the lion king on snes
what the
yes, really
there was another time when i actually threw sand in my dad's eyes on the playground xd
i must have been mad at him that day lol
lmao
demonlord: *bends down to pick up sand and mutters to himself* "heh, nerd"
i  back with fresh underwear
the only person you have to fear pissing off is gummy and he'd never dare defying his sis
getting out of bed is hard
im not depressed i dont think but i have a tendency to sleep in till 3 pm
lol that‚Äôs late i dunno i don‚Äôt have faith in myself to not bug people if i in wheelchair right now
the latest i've slept in was 5 pm lmao
demonlord you madlad
ooooh
kugal have you even read my code
i tried promoting my deviantart no biters
in fact i think i killed the server
im busy right now
they will be back
great one of the only surveys i qualify for money on breaks goodie
how do you search up users lol
im back again
lets see dis bootiful art of yours
i dunno
sunset too
im getting my bank account set up
i thought it was like a sub thing
you throwing me money drago?
100 = one dollar
(‚ïØ¬∞–¥¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ /(.‚ñ° . \\)
lmao
go away skarm
im gonna be out of bed for at least another couple of hours
u live west coast too kugal
oh nice
im not sure my parents were just like "we're moving to oregon" one day and now we've changed our minds apparently
he must really hates it
even sis is better at making fun of me
skarm are you dead
lion king
lion king ida
me want to pet
i want it
and everyone runs
needs more plaid
whats up gang
nice
sorry regal :(
you got it
being too sexy?
maybe you could try the crime of sharing cute puppy pictures everywhere without permission
sounds dreadful
i second that
king corphish
king nappy fell
keep it classy, pok√©tubers
regel guess how many gay youtubers im subbed to
youre only subbed to 30 people?
ok 60
not 30
demon
37.1
that's too rational of a number
i just realized
guys
you forgot we are missing someone
<:wat:579563576914870333>
i miss him
until flubs is back
viking sis
gummy that sounds like a real good way to get her mad at you
or both of us
i'm too busy being sad all the time to be mad
final fantasy is making you sad
after windows update
drago you need an update as well
god damn it
did someone say bollocks üëÄ
we used to have a lot of kitties
but we dont anymore
guess my parents we're just allergic?
cute.
while it wasn't my favorite show, i'll admit i liked it too at one point lol
it starts one minute in
in what numerical base?
let's go with 10 for now
sweet
tyler oakley
sounds about right
two girls one dude
i see
wouldnt the dude get lonely
one girl two cups anyone
maybe viking sis as well
hes an innocent boi
can i not share links on mobile
but anyway even if you dont get the original joke, the second joke is that i'm apparently using a girl's name on a business account
the third joke is that i'm too uncreative to come up with more than one fictional name in my life
so gummy should pipe down
in wonder how many words i've said in my life, and what percentile that puts me in for all of humanity
god damn it
my problem is how it makes you think the chat is fully updated and then it updates at last second and then theres 50 new chats in front of you
anyone around? i need someone
i'm here
i need an intervention
im back
justy had dinner
it doesn‚Äôt matter guys
can i call you rigel?
that's a star in some constellation somewhere that's probably going to explode when it dies
hmmm
i hate everyone equally
besides you and will, not really
yeah she's actually an art major in college iirc
she never online
alrighty, have fuuuun
what's up ^w^
also i'm always around it's just that my silly phone would say i'm offline when i go on something else that isn't discord lol
nice nice lol ^w^
haha yeah i dont want to slee
but i should if i want tomorrow to not suck
but it's going to anyway because i'll be in the car for five hours
am i the only one who doesnt really care about the fireworks
some dumbass shot one off at 12:07 this morning
oh nice
i've heard several go off every now and then lol
will is it even tomorrow where you live yet
in an hour and 20 minutes it will be lol
whatever
sleep
same here
west coast gang
she's even more cultured than i am
wait, that applies to everyon
aaaa
since i'll be there for a week
that's the plan anyway
lol nice ^w^
hehe looks like mod training for kendall did well
it opened yay lol ^w^
kk, nighty night
oh no
that is not a very reassuring combo tbh
are you okay sis?
take it easy then
sorry sis that your other gift never happened
19.12 is quite the fun amount :>
but im trying to get that other gift for you that will be late
for that matter, i should, too
apparently
some 60s thing
we know it's you.
i know right
kugal youre not allowed to not play video games
dang ok
so the switch lite is coming out in september apparently
it‚Äôs cheaper and less fun
just in time for 2 years of knowing each other
pretty much yeah
i missed you too my dude
sis kinda took your ambassador job over at gummyland...
either that or i thought you would hate my guts
ida surprisingly gets along with everyone there well
more like
hes gonna be a bounty hunter
flubs will help me
that is not a plan for success
free slurpee
tell us
i never knew you liked drugs
i don't do drugs but i do take cannabis to help me stay relaxed
you calling drugs, meds makes sense
can i have some?
drugs are not cool
why do you even want the meds though
thats not how anything works
and it's in a nice case
gummyland doesn‚Äôt need me much anymore these days to be active
who wants to keep this place active?
i am sorta
flubs i just check my server
damn
i like your server but if i dont take it in small doses it hurts
server too huge gummyland i mean
do they still all hate each other?
but thats normal
tbh all i do there is basically talk about how smoking sucks
vaping is gross
like flubs said, this economy is ruthless
some vape flavors might smell worse than cigarette smoke. which is saying something
what kind?
it's a danganronpa reference
$1 for a cup of noodles? thats a good fairy
look ida, free money!
it's open, boiled, and in your hair
im here friendos
or we could be lewd here _and_ there!
what even the crap kugal
i can put it in the gutter in _half_ that time
that's like
youre pretty dang good
is seeing how fast you can hurl a ten-pound mass
bam strike
i can hurl the ten pound mass about 17 mph on a good day
thats how i won against like 4 other people one time lmao
which is 14.3 mph
interestingly, i did the math and if i can hurl a 5 oz mass at 60 miles per hour that only comes up with half the kinetic energies as the bowling ball
shrimp!
that looks like popcorn shrimp
i personally like shrimp when i don't think about them too much
like the part where they're basically massive bugs?
oh right, plastic in the seafood
we're just trained to be disgusted by bugs
but cattle isn't sustainable for the rest of the world to all eat at our rate
bison
bison is supposed to be healthier than cattle for proteim
dy/dx (e^x) ?
e^x * dx/dy
more of an irrational constant, its quite real
wait this is an integral?
no thanks i tried bothering my calc teacher with int(sqrt(xx+4)) and he just said "no you cant do that, go use a calculator"
yea!
if it was a hot tub you could say it was a boiling pot of water with other people and people would start asking interesting questions
thonk
time to do something crazy
i got a haircut
and since some of them know my mom it was awkward for me
she is probably the best person to cut my hair
she will take me to anger management...again
well i like smashing keyboards
fluba
flubs
nobody should display interests in public
gummy go get me advil im out
hell no
actually dont, it doesnt do anything and its bad for your organs
so glad to have her back
well you did
sis and i need to hang out more
i hear hes cool
kugal, i'll hang with you
nothing wrong with some cannibalism to start your day
you guys make my heart melt
only im allowed to get angry at kugal
what on earth did i do to deserve this
flubs
happy 2 years of knowing each other
gummy make the pain go away
i can't
gummy that's your morning routine
say what?>
that's one dang expensive box
i never do
drago get pineapple
my brother likes pineapple actually
make it the whole controller
half the controller
ya boy got a switch
my face is great
that bodys a real shame though
damn right its flubs
it's fibus
i had pizza
and you didnt even give me any. some friend you are
it's for benny
benny shouldnt have pizza its got cheese on it
no thanks
is it history?
ask drago
part of me is arguing with myself
skarm same
drago is maria
i just broke another one of my dishes
yea, get some fresh air might help clear your head
sorry if i worried you guys, but i thought it was important for me to be upfront with you guys
but i realized i'm not gonna feel better if i don't reach out
dont worry about it dude we're here if you need us
are you sure you dont need a hug
and the offer on the hug still stands
i still have no excuse for breaking dishes though
sometimes ya gotta do whatcha gotta do, i've done plenty more dumber in my life so dont beat yourself too much over it
i didnt have like a 4 hour dinner lmao
the feel loving one, for example
my ex who was paying for herself and her "sister" it's like similar to me and ida as siblings was hit hard with bills and stuff
and there was a song/special release mentioning about perfection
or only with me because of money
oh jeez your anti-leaching off of her
gummy there was a scene in stranger things when lucas was like "max and i already broke up five times" and i thought of you immediately
he hates me
that's time you could be antagonizing me instead
oh gummy i know the strat there
either way she did say one thing
i never gave up
> you think
her current state is none of my business, it stopped being my business many many moons ago
which one is sarah?
oh shush its her fault
sure why not its a funny story
idk i think 3 things was too many
flubs, buddy, you have _really_ bad luck when it comes to girlfriends
i guess everyone has their demons
luckily
i mean she might not be
oh hai flubs
no i did not kill her, this is not true this is bullshit. i did ***not***
i also didnt poison her
no youre his master
i have a shirt that looks like that
and today i spilled sauce on it
i want a version of that where i says "be rational" and œÄ says "kill yourself"
he really doesnt like complex numbers i guess
says you
i need to get in contact with your aunt immediately
kucf
he likes shirts
thats literally my entire outlook on life thanks for distilling my being into a single sentence. not gonna haunt me at night. nope
<:coolgal:596255472324182017> <:charlie:579566514248744963>
true
the fuck
maybe sis should train my staff...
i don't think i'm qualified
well heres a degree
so how are you sis
you're not alone
tbh i think we'd all be a bit happier if it weren't for social media
social media really dements what we know as real social relationships. i know i'd be a lot happier hanging out with irl friends than browsing reddit for hours a day... if i had any.
like i used to always grind school but i havent really done so since its summer and my brain has just been like "you degenerate of a human get to work"
thats good sis
i'm trying to find groups of computer people physically located \*somewhere in new jersey\* who i could go meet as part of the "making friends" part of finding a job
"i halp"
drago
gummy
how about you be friends with me?
but i thought you liked my math stuff?
this is certainly an eye opening experience
no to destroy someone mentally advice
or maybe it was stab them
yeah, just not always great for _gummy_
then she msgs me saying we will never stream again
so i asked her whats wrong and she said her other ex bf threw a tantrum because she wanted to live stream with me over watching stuff with him
why is everyone on the internet a goddamn child
i literally was like
becuase im not 18 yet flubs
flubs dont ask questions you already know the answer to
ok but if they arent dating why does he care what she does and why does she care what he thinks
so this is the situation
yeah but still. it seems like all the gears in this broken watch and stopped
what kind of asinine reason is that
idk but he only attacks when she and me are streaming
he gets custody bc hes known her longer? fuckin idiot
gummy how can you be so consistently smart and dumb like this at the same time
my actions however aren‚Äôt smart
then we arent friends any more >:(
flubs stop hanging out with flubs
sure he sucks
no need to waste time
but i know his bf to keep him off us
nuuuuuu üò¶
hey no nuking servers is my thing
and tend to complain to flubs about my issues
im literally meeting this guy at bronycon in two weeks
punch time yay
i wanna collect muskets
ahahahah
gummy if you actually suspect there's going to be a physical confrontation contact the security desk and tell them
i can‚Äôt wait to meet drago at magfest
a real confrontation will happen
i'll go!
i should show up to magfest but not say so, and then nobody would figure it out
but he can do that from here
top ten best pranks
yeah but then id have to find you
thats like coming to america and saying "hes the fat one"
yeah i'm like the only normal person there
ehhh
drago looks like discount drago
drago. he does it
jesus christ 5 years
yeah but since hes finished a series
ah yeah
last one was black & white 2
stop being old
was it really that common
well a 15 year old shouldnt be dating a 12 year old
flubs are you 7?
i knew it
im 7 too
i'm a newborn plus or minus 23.8
fuck caillou
don‚Äôt judge me flubs
new me is dumb too
im getting a milkshake
or kill me
or both
olay
vanilla with chocolate syrup
go boil your head
who me?
gummy wanna get married?
no one is at this age
me marrying ida sounds like a good way for me to get murdered by ida
perhaps
same with flubs
thing is
im quite timid irl
i will murder them!
online im grumpy
if i was the wizard, would gummy be the thief and ida would be the viking?
i was thinking if i had to pick a convention to go to, it would probably be magfest
(i thought thief was my job tho)
skarm fuck you
flubs i wanna meet you as well
my dog is not the alcoholic in our relationship
on a side note, i would also rather wait till trump is out of office before i travel to the d.c. area
sorry for getting political there but yeah
no thats just a good idea
looking at dc from an airplane, 15 minutes away from congress and the whitehouse are neglected neighborhoods that nobody wants to invest money into fixing. really says a lot about congress' activities
i actually live really close to route 1's new jersey section and it's officially my least favorite road of all time
cool kids need to take constantly backed up bridges
both go east to west and theyre exactly the same
google maps doesnt even give the parkway its numerical designation lmao
trains
trains do not work
dont know
i would _totally_ take the train places instead of driving if getting to the station didn't involve walking through all of rutgers and half of new brunswick
it's actually not as ugly as the turnpike but the detail where it's seven lanes in both directions for like half of it sorta cuts the effect
the projected date to finish it is 2022, which means the next projected date is 2030 and the completion date is never because the lirr is hell
there's a relatively small county road which relatively minor construction began in 2015, was supposed to take a few months and finally finished in late 2017
uuuuuuuuuuh
ooh or is it parts of the vehicle
im not sure we're both about to find out
theyre all special
speed limits should be ignored if traffic conditions make them unsafe üíØ
excuse you i _like_ doing 60 in the 65 zone
my dad is the expert of always sticking with the speed limit, even if it means not going with the flow of traffic. we'll be on the freeway doing 60 when everyone is doing 70 and he'll be like "look at all these idiots!"
drivers here are slightly less horribl
left lane = the place not to be a dumbass is what i picked up on too
what about on windows 10?
last week this semi truck came like 2 inches away from smushing my dad and i on the freeway
im glad i was looking down at my phone or i prolly would've shat my pants
that seems like a weird case where you would use `me and my dad`
im the mathboi
the rule is "if you would say `me` without `other person` it's `[other person] and me`, otherwise it's `i`
same
if it was just a grammar usage and mechanics class of that's an automatic f
we'd rotate, at first we did reading, then for the next unit or two we did vocabulary, and then the dreaded grammar
what in the cinnamon toast fuck
that though is fine yo
yough and yo
are basically the same
it makes sense
you see?
oh ok
believe what you can understand for that is the purpose of languagge
language is hard
we should abolish language
what is your guys' dream language you'd wanna learn
dovahzul
i was looking at kotlin today and it looks pretty neat but i don't know if i'd ever really use it for much
people tell me rust is fun to work with, and lately ive been talking to a guy who lives and breathes in haxe
rust is a shitty game
and then it oxidized
i mean i've got both those endings in nier automata, t was funnier though
since i have no idea what we're talking about, w
flubs why are you upside down
can you hear can you hear that thunder?
which is why i sleep on my stomach, but according to every chiropractor, that is the act of a madman and you should never sleep on your belly
really?
flubs you were weird before this
fair
anyone home?
just hide it behind the big rock, nobody'll see it there probably
no we all know it's his rarity body pillow xd
leave it behind the rock and we can talk about this somewhere else
musket parts?
do i have to sign in order for you to set it on fire?
yea i would say that's accurate
maybe you need an older sis
like my viking sis
i only have one sister and she's absolutely horrible.
then buy her new stuff again.
i really doubt it, to be honest. she has my step-father's personality, and my step-father is the worst person i have ever met, and she shares a lot of character trails with him, which is an awful sign.
flubs why is all my compliments offensive and my insults are non offensive?
good
dammit and i just bought a switch lmao
this is why i wait
drago why is it everytime you buy something, and then they announce better stuff?
because i'm cursed
very much so
brot
but it's noon
i'm died
ida i need advice
they mention jeans flubs
and i burnt them all
same
i dont even dislike jeans
same
of the skinny variety
jeans look nice though
bad gum
skinny jeans are fabulous
<:pinkiedab:516359552090898453>
so kiddies
this is like 4 keyboards in total in less than one year
swimming in money sure is fun though
but think of the paper cuts
the alternatives are you all give flubs all your possessions and i skip town
all i want right now is stormy
i'm back for the next 2 minutes and i'll see ya guys in a month
even though she let us go early
oh damn gummys making bank
i‚Äôll be there from 31-5
gummy come to new york its objectively better than all the other us cities
no flubs
i don't know if i've ever been to baltimore
this is why new orleans is the best
‚Äúgummy do you think about anything other than food?‚Äù
im grumpy
frick
any glasses you wear are your cute glasses kugals
im a bully blitz
yay gummys a bully
that same guy also showed me his private part twice
i knew he had it in him
oh bully, kugal is here
this place is bully
be specific
how do you bully
flubs bully animal man
you told me you wanted to
damn camelot is making us all not violent
nobody is gonna fight back against the dude in a wheelchair, so i dont bully
sis was violent
but back when i was just the kinda scrawny kid who liked to run i would bully
was i violent?
you stayed the same
besides forcing two secretary birds to make  a baby?
you can do it demon lord, demons are pretty violent.
imma post lewd shit
ditto
actually i'm asexual so it doesn't really matter to me
who me?
this is what kugal is
is that gummy's?
i believe that is charlie the dog's wrist
this is me<:charlie:579566514248744963>
and this is my dog charlie <:coolgal:596255472324182017>
that‚Äôs benny‚Äôs wrist
mine are 7" around
wait
you measure your wrists
yes i had to for the bracelet lol
dragonite and i need to be lewd together again
nighty night
good night my son
i will though
they didn't move into the house we were cleaning out until the late 90s
so the medicine had been expired for a decade, and instead of disposing it, they took it with them
medicine can expire?
most of the time it won't do what it's intended to do, and depending on the compound it could introduce new unfortunate things
but the fact that people use twitter
game designers' home planet is twitter apparently so i'm okay with it existing since it's probably a net positive in my life currently
which was dumb in its own right
thanks drago
oh drago
have fun with that i guess
hey cool you have the same kind of cabinets my old house had
no grenades or rocket launchers? amateurs
woo!
thanks flubs
thanks kugal
you know what
lmao
if you saw this, it would make you so angry
yes it‚Äôs peta...but for once i agree
wait what
also wait are the roots 0 -3 and -4? im very rusty with this stuff
you can also yank out a 3
4 and 3
guys i got a new dream job
well reviews are mixed so i was just wondering
i got my switch set up too
a bit. its white
i see
thank you flubs
fair enough
im thinking about making a survey for gumland
drago...you were in charge of this one
gummyland is like a reactor powered by explosions that uses its created power to regenerate itself
today i sent this message
and no flubs gumland is stable
exactly. its stable but extremely fucking chaotic
skarm shut up
tbh it wasn't zeal itself as much as the people there that were getting to me
ash is also dead
all in favour of inviting squid and rc?
and drago don‚Äôt you put me down?
no flubs
no but you put me down too so it's okay probably
you two helped me glue everything
awesome!
im very happy to have you around
sigh
mood
and realized half of you wouldn‚Äôt survive in gumland
sis and flubs are lasting long though
did i have this poc
im getting new shoes soon
kugal i think i'm flagging you as "best friends"
mason <:pinkielaugh:544330346964058132>
thats my name shut up
dick
kugal his name is eric not richard
my name is supergummying
mason dope
im pretty sure most, if not all of you losers know my last name
and possibly where i live
but i cannot say it or i get beat up
i could probably find out what it is but she clearly doesn't want it out there so i won't try :p
didnt gummy also guess my name? i forget
at some point i just decided that flubs name was "steve" and i dont know if i actually had a reason for that
do you remember if i had a reason, steve?
paul
i haven't met too many people irl with my name oddly enough
well i meant dan lol
there was only like one class in high school i was in where there was another dan
it was a food class
gummy probably remembers who i'm referring to lol
yes i know
dunno if theyre all like this but the subways ive been to just . . . don't have good lettuce. or vegetables. or bread. or meat. the sauce is okay sometimes but i usually want more than sauce for a meal.
although i suppose
i had no idea there were any in the us
i guess five guys is technically fast food, and i actually like five guys a lot, so there's that
i know there was at least one tim hortons in rochester but i didn't have a car then and i wasn't about to get on my bike to go to fast food
i'm almost positive there's one in new jersey _somewhere_ but it sure isn't near me
flubs five guys is the best and i'm going to condemn you to eating cajun fries until you die
i knew it
then you cough up the meat and swallow it
flubs you are good at this
you should give lessons
flubs give me your waller
mine has the imperial legion symbol thingie on it, you can';t have it
mines just a brown leather thing from the 30s or something
oh you know what
anyone wanna join?
thats why the trick is to not mess up
flubs i nominate you to be the next man on the moon
pretty expensive
yeah bc its far
alternatively just wait a couple billion years till the sun goes red
scared the crap out of my mother though
vector equations and plane equations are loads of fun
he meant me
hi sisters
my ffxiv character posing like a fate/stay night character
cool
but i haven't seen that many people gathered at the park since 2016 lol
ah it all makes sense now
i deactivated my twitter a few days ago
i see
mom: grandma, these are your pants that you left here
grandma: why do you have my pants?
mom: you brought them over because you wanted to wash them but didnt have a full load of laundry
dad: no they're from the time you went home without your pants
i wanna watch mind games and social engineering not weird unacknowledged racism
me too
sis are you sure you don‚Äôt wanna watch lion king live action with me?
wooo
gummy i think she meant she was sure she didn't wanna watch it lol
hey gummy i hear youre in the market for another sibling
drago you can't date your siblings
according to both us and canadian law
just nobody knows to arrest you for it
im not dating gummy im dating kugal
i think
the third party is you
you observed yourself breaking the laws
imagine what people would be "encouraged" to do if you had the option to not take breaks
part time master
time to retrieve it tomorrow
i've got a question
steak
oooh
demon lord has it right
eh i hit enter too early
pizza with a topping of steak. the fun part comes in that bits of steak are dropped onto the pizza as its being cooked so you never know if the next hit if meat will be brown, blue, pink, or almond
alright brbr imma go get steak
nice to meet you
im back with my steak
i'll share with drago since he's my date
flubs, buck you. i don't want to sleep, i want to stay awake.
flubs fuck you
parents came remember
ffffffuuuuuuccckkkk
you know it
mondays don't exist
tuesday happens twice
<:wat:579563576914870333>
tuesday 0:03 am
look it's not my fault you never learned the days of the week
<#542153256898658319>
it's the fur okay
or scientifically speaking, it's the floof
hehe
hello gang
how do you know if a bar is gay or not? did you see it making out with another bar?
no i joined in
you'll be all right kugal
i don't know why you're going but i've been through similar experiences since i was a kid
not gonna lie i totally cried during that phone call lol
how thought provoking
<:wat:579563576914870333>
im back from ss office
thank god
schutzstaffel office
<:wat:579563576914870333>
no, it was a schutzstaffel office.
he was blowing it up
gummy if it makes you feel any better i'm sure there are already a ton of suspected murderers already in your province
i dont know if that would actually make you feel better or not
aw thanks
what happened to the other keyboads lol
i found it out completely by accident and was shocked
my keyboard is so cheap but i love it
and this is where bad luck starts
which is also missing the shift key
sis you need a new laptop
depends on whether you plug it into the port next to the heat sink or not
and that had button issues
i told you people about the old keyboard i had that was okay except for the real heavy keys right?
nope
well mine aren't heavy keys
it may just be simple teasing.
same
>there's already that thing added?
yes üòÉ
no problemo friendo
that or we just made the volcanoes angry
i think people as hot as flubs contribute the most
volcanoes are human enthusiasts confirmed
it beat up your hand.
guys i have exciting news
dont ask how i know
how do you know master?
e!wolfram can gummy bears contract vampirism?
shit
after gummy dies, i take dips on his pc!
sis gets that as well
i have two flubs
thanks.
green is the nerdiest of the colors
i will try out that windirstat program.
there's also ccleaner and stuff that can identify large temporary files and whatever
that thing
reminds me of windows defender lmao
its good if youre not an idiot online
thanks flubs
good thing im not an idiot online
flubs
you own a company
but i wont
pattent pending
no risk, no obligation, no red tape, no down payment
so come on in for a free demonstration and a free consultation
with our friendly, professional staff. our experienced and knowledgeable sales representatives will help you make a selection that's just right for you and just right for your budget
speaking of money
i got my debit card today pog
i've only got an interest checking and a money market account
should also probably get a stock market account set up and invest once the next correction hits
sounds lit
you're lit, gummy!
y'all are lit
get drago to put it out
oh crap it's animalmanaanaoan
aminal
oh shoot gotta go
why the ***fuck*** am i green
animalunderscoremanunderscore
so far so good, kugal in a blitzz, how are you doing, kugal in a blitzz?
nein
i bet it is cool, for a math wiz
lul wut
that's all you should be doing
you better not
right now i am working on bringing the server to a staple 200
i mean, i might leave the computer, but discord will still be on
when flubs join the server only had like 80
red is dans color
animal\_man\_
f30252
i prefer dixie land though
you'll get there
and that is lincoln's fave song
interesting
maybe this red is better
everything else is light
even on windows
skarm
though i can do that if you want
damn it
gosh i'm not special anymore because you chump nuggits took my color
what
no way
and musket games
and cooking mama
you have to game at least somewhat reguarly
i mean i liked the first one on ds but after that they went overboard imo
specifically the first one, but 2 isn't bad
infinite mario levels
omg that looks exactly like my cat
it's a real possibility
thought...
it took me 3 hot hours
e!role thing
e!role thing
yeah me too but anyone who watches jojo and plays siege is cool in my book
try that
e!role thing
e!role thing
no clue what you mean
re: windirstat guys i think i might be a videographer
indeed
back from dinner follks
i ‚ù§ you too bot
all organized and perfectly balanced as all things should be.
awesome
i second that
but almost getting hit by a car is like almost dying
behold mortals
nothing crazy there, everything in the order of operations makes sense
now ive heard of george carlin
good
this guy seems on the up-and-up
he died 11 years ago
but yeah he was very lively
‚Äúif my doctor told me i had only six minutes to live, i wouldn't brood. i'd type a little faster.‚Äù 
‚Äï isaac asimov
what i was just talking about with not dwelling on life he really addresses that starting at around 38 mins
gummy forcing me to be social
so hi bitches
gummy i say whatever i want and you know it
im hereeeeee
oh gummy i still mad at you
wait no
thats starlight
oooo hot
thanks.
best description of punic wars ever
kugal no yoshi üò©
really
he's pretty talented
kek.
yeah drago, you need an update
i did update
or something
fen can be a brosister
kugal wanna be my brosister?
nothing animal man
but we're all very homo
... i have issues
gummy it‚Äôs your fault
yes i wasn‚Äôt hyper until you forced me to be social
i don't want to be social
sis you will be social
my caregiver basically living here this weekend isn‚Äôt that social enough
the hell
gummy, you know what you gotta do.
it was random really lol
i'm not sure how to feel about that xd
wow, nice.
you're as old as one of my friends.
you same age as me cool
nice
im pissy right now star
tmnt?
skarm and demonlord are twinsies
you know i realize it's probably on github
lol beak
to be fair i wouldn‚Äôt mind some hand holding action
i face palmed so hard
that is an infinitely better mnemonic than the one i learned
he‚Äôs won‚Äôt eat him
it's 9:30
it was dark an hour and a half ago
dude biking in darkness is great
so that might actually help
the dude was kicking till like 80 he covered a lot of shit
i'm like 95% sure the mets are going to lose
i mean i get the part where a solid half of all games are derivatives of ping pong
youre 100% sure the mets are gonna lose drago
xcom odds
why are you so optimistic about this flubs
bc i was raised a yankees fan
oh no
how awful
oh hell yeah
im only in gamemaker and letsplay and a couple others that only get like one post a day like pokemonrmxp and stuff
everything drago does is fun and good (:
okay fine i'll make them take a bath
flubs you are green
im like a very pale white on a good day
on a bad day im pretty sure i just reflect all light
shes plotting to take over gummyland once and for all
oh jeez sorry about the spoilers then
it happens to the best of us
sure discord just dont load the gif dammit
it‚Äôs that time of the week again where i question how well i am as a server owner
cause no one here can run gumland
<:thanosthink:582667010392195115>
i just worked opening to closing
ahhhhh
how many hours is that? :|
t mock the super sentient ai
8 hours
master i finished up the kepler thingy no one took up the offer before i finished the lesson feelsbadman lol
the good news: today is mr met on the moon day at citi field and they still have some left when we arrived
the bad news: mom's phone decided to bug out so they can't scan our tickets to let us in
welcome to the future
i figured out how to make my ffxiv character read
/r/brandnewsentence
it's the max level
i see
but now it has confirm to also be ending
go skydiving, try some meth, see a play
guys i think i went to the wrong game
drago went to an alternate universe
we got pizza yus
lol me too
yesssss
we can be pizza sisters
it's 2019 after all
be both
that sounds like a challenge
lets switch for a day then flubs
switch forever?
and you wouldnt have to go to college or work any more
because eyan thought it was confusing
i must have been either sleeping or just too busy to pay attention to stream
get better flubs
september 20th could be a fascinating day...
the green or yelow?
there is now rgb
hmmm
thonk
not me
never played
cause you are constantly tired so i gotta keep you away
gummy i had an opportunity to give you a war cry
shit
apparently i'd manage to get int
or perish
is that an `and` or `or`
gotcha
you fool
you think that you can catch me with this
no i meant thanks
tho gummy might know some of them
eimm people
oh yes, they are all cool
not even the || redacted ||
and then she killed me again
since i don't do the whole betray people very well
thats cause youre very dependent on people doing work for you
since they do it too much
yeah i am too tbh
what me?
when she died that one game
i was basically screwed
we need to find a new game
speaking of which i havent played that in a while
oh my god yes
fine i will download it now
give me link
no you mean youre going to download it overnight and install it tomorrow afternoon
im usually online if you feel like trying to get into it
thanks sis
which still lets you try all of the classes
you'll name your character upon creating them
something about story progress?
i was just wandering in random directoins and doing stuff that people told me to last time i played ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
cause that's kinda what quests are like
you should be fine doing that until you figure out a more directed approach
iirc i have fire, ice and one that i don't really know what is for
while ice mode nerfs your fire damage but buffs your mp regen to insane amounts
and time to sleep
commentary
rip x 2
i'm lacking in microphone and the ability to talk into a microphone
yeah i didnt know if that was a thing you actually would do or not but i figured id ask
stereotype about dragoons is that they always die
oh come on now _i_ want to hear your voice
gummy you sure you dont want to commentate? i wanna hear _your_ voice
good point
basically my ex told me not to be stupid in front of her sister which is like ida and me, they aren't actually blood related
but point is to not act stupid
wait what
did that msg delte?
i have no clue
holy crap i thought we removed that like a year ago
sis attack!
musket
muskets
it's `ex`, from _that_ stage
she was telling me not to act stupid in public
my sister keeps calling breath of the wild "the wild man game" because she can't remember the actual title
im gonna call it that from now on cos i like that name a lot more
<a:a_wild_gremlin:590514192507994132>
animal crossing stream in about two hours
<:ponkohyouknow:525081375888506883>
wasn't starlight here already?
actually i don't think they care
...morning????
i just got out of bed about.... 5 minutes ago
hacker yes
and everything
i was eating a burger
<:pinkie_awkward_smile:636655055134785558>
i deny all allegations of attempting to give bringina chocolate with hot sauce and hot mustard
i'm just showing
here take this sis, that should keep you happy
chicken? extra no.
oh you don‚Äôt like chicken
well mitch we should see if we can drag tenda in
if she hasn‚Äôt slept
also some vandalized the first nations university
hey sis i gave a warning about me saying something stupid, plus im in a russia mood because im currently learning about the russian empire, and the song itself is truly beautiful. it legit sounds like a lullaby
e!xkcd 2265
what im trying to say is it can either save you a step or cast variables when you dont want them casted and its a double edged sword like no fucking other
wow im dumb
there we go
e!crash
i really want a hot dog now
e!bot
disgusting
like gums when he was young
but vietnam
so i've just been informed of some rather
‚Äúyoung people in vietnam continue to be taught at home and at school that same-sex attraction is a ‚Äúdisease‚Äù and a ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù that can be cured and treated, despite legislation designed to support and protect lgbtq+ rights.‚Äù
fuck i forgot about the review
so he has a terrible infection in his hand, which has spread to his arm
yeah
he is expected to make it through to summer
the sooner he starts making money again the better
3. don't invade russia at all unless you can conquer siberia before october starts
also germans did well against russia in ww1
what
all the more for the rest of us
with whipped cream
and there are two more in fridge
we already have whip cream though
why _don't_ i need cake topping
why is gums always happier when streaming nintendo shit than pc shit and why does he get better views?
because "pc shit" is probably league and league is toxic af
pretty much
theyre fun
kugal you should probably play the kingdom rush games too
fun is an illusion by the entertainment industry to sell more
frick, they're really good at it
my backlog has actually gotten smaller so far in 2020 instead of bigger
ask sis
a lot of updates have been flooding in
but 90% of them are great updates
so im very thrilled
wait you read all the msgs here? what happened to being lazy?
thought i said a lot yesterday
exactly
forgot to do that lately
okay
also now that it's not constantly bugging out the new youtube studio's actually okay
admittedly it took them like two years to iron it out, but still
and gums is being threatened on twitch
like take a look
yeah who would even do that, also congratulations on your achievements bringinga
you rang
he only has like 45k subs
no but seriously
44k views in 3 days
if your pok√©mon series is binomial or higher i'm not interested
what the hell is a binomial?
anyways
gums with bringy and with tenda lurking around
binomial means its got two names like all spanish people
thanks flubs
216 questions lets go
it's like a binary partition but more bureaucratic
see i called it
who?
basically cool germany
then i learned where poland was and thought "oh that explains why it gets invaded by russia so often"
why is pic so bad?
eh fuck it
the kingdom prussia started off in a small territory of poland
the two will connect together after destroying poland
and i didn't realize there was a middle ground
well it was a small kingdom that grew
oh i love that music
actually no
they were just called the german empire
that's like saying sparta survived till today, implying they were still a self sufficient city state
in some cases the epic covers are just completely unmodified
most of my history comes from the bean people over at extra credits
which one was i thinking of?
lmao
meanwhile athens absolutely fucked the persians up at marathon, so hard, they sent them back home with a grudge
oh wow
so how were athenians on equality?
in grade 10 class
while all guys prefer athens
but still, pretty good imo
not like roman slaves or something like that
vikings are metal af
but i think those were also able to work for their freedom
which was followed by ww2 and us being cut off from denmark and basically going "screw this"#
they did, because greek skirmishes were a daily thing
that'd make tug-o-war more interesting
i bet they were called the dark ages because it was before they'd invented the light bulb
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
then fucked thwm right back when they were weak
ouch
too bad it was another 1000 years until greece figured out flamethrowers
true
$47 in total for gas
so probably
i always get a new followers
i take it someone didnt make it through
nah i just felt like roasting
nor have i had a mood swing
that's good
lads got powers but this one dude dont. hes the main character
gummy told me u hate anime
it's a shonen anime
yeah ive watched heroaca. fell off with the latest season bc it didnt interest me but enjoyed it up to that
the animation looks pretty neat though
its pretty light on the moaning which is nice
not free of moaning, but close enough
its a good show but kinda weird
the escalation from normal to weird is slow enough that if you watch the whole show it doesnt matter but if you skip pretty much any of it youll drown
i've made some mha oc concepts
real name: something japanese 
hero name: lord fafnir
quirk: transform into a massive fire breathing dragon, but is incapable of speech while transformed
age: 41
status: deceased
ngl i love momentum related powers
accelerating mass and shit is kind of insanely op
i sense two opposing forces at play here
you rang
name a more iconic duo
so guysss
so me
okay i found a quiz i wanna do
but hey at least im not an absolute monarchy believer?
guys
e!crash -f
e!crash -f
e!exit -f
now to modify the batch file to accommodate for that
alright
i just rolled two critical fails in a row in dnd
e!bot
i like how im maybe and drago is just a flat no
no he is nice
i have finalized the most important development in the history of let's plays
is that image 8 pixels or has my internet died
that is a damn fine idea though
is it bad that i'm legitimately worried about the bunny dying before we finish the game? because the bunny's like 9 years old and the game is listed as 50 hours on hltb
oh god not rabbit
i can't right now
he has one and only one facial expression, and it's "intense disapproval"
so here is my latest commissionb
ooooh
oh drago
is this true?
i want spaghetti
bringina doesn‚Äôt wanna watch batman forever and batman and robin
~~mario boobs~~
hello sis
if you were to claim he's gay *and horny*, though, then it might work.
but people assume he made them like that because he was gay
diego might
is diego even still in here?
same
cant you filter by event like "join / leave," "nick change," etc though?
joins and leaves don't appear
welp
it doesn‚Äôt
it circulated a while ago
not you too
e!bot
my log bot records all joins and leave
and they are not allowed to join voice call
i feel like you would get a lot of those, somehow
we do
gummyland is on a public discord site
us being a pony server targets a lot of raiders
but this would be the first time he's uploaded since discord became a thing
funny how time flies right?
something like that
ah yeah
and the last thing i want is sis being pissed off
drago very simple, edgy 16 year old
reminds me a bit of skullkidfan in a way
you are either on her soft side or not
thank god im usually her soft side
also drago
oh two more as well
banned 3 already
that messed them up
mod training vids?
yes flubs
what did you think though?
is for anyone who is a regular or a non troll
i also dont think we have chick fil a
be super super nice to regulars or new nice people
it was more because it was on the side of the turnpike and i needed food than because i wnted to
want an ice cream sandwich?
who am i kidding anything is probably used as a lewd term
i mean a real ice cream sandwich
that is wondeful
truly we live in an age of wonder
thought these are better
who would willingly admit they live in wyoming
anyone living in wyoming
wyoming falls into the list of like 25 states that could be consolidated into one and still be both the least populous and interesting
carbs and sugar in one meal
of course that's not happening now lol
make trudeau buy the entire usa
im happy to hear that
mitch im disgusted
gummy is british and not canadian
my dream was to move to the uk
everyone here is either left or close to left
it has to be a castle or palace
with*
but i wanted to make a joke about there being no dying in the pokemon world
make a joke
make a joke!
yes there is death
they kinda brushed over lavender town in the anime
the original series brushed a lot through tbh
strangely enough though i think it was the best series out of the first dozen or so because of how they didn't have as much filler
20% was not filler in johto
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
<a:rarityspeechless:585545014927556636>
male feminists are basically people that support women or something
guys
if you don‚Äôt
guys
no surprise there
that series has been running for 25 weeks and youre just now realizing that?
im in the library
i had no time this morning to make breakfast
we dont have food
yeah i don't get it either, but amd's tripled in the last three years so i probably shouldn't complain
guys
it's the newest one
see? new,
im going to play so much of that gme
most people considered mystery dungeon dead so hopefully this one does well so they can continue it
hopefully it captures the charm of the originals well
i mean i don‚Äôt think we had any stupid bits in the original game?
like if a pokemon you recruit faints then it gets unrecruited.... that was a bad change
but i also have a real copy
which i think i bought in... estonia?
twice
7 years ago
why do you have lewd art of your oc
do not answer that
im narcissistic
is it incest though?
it isn‚Äôt
i assume you let it off in the woods on friday, let it bounce around randomly for two days and pick it up again on sunday
why are you advertising that you have lewds
you just rapidly oscillate the muscles that contract and expand a limb. i can do that for short periods of time with my left arm before it starts hurting.
flubs eats food?
too bad see ya in heaven, loser
life is full of regrets
by "these pretzels" do you mean a specific pretzel or just pretzels in general?
i meant in general
sorry i didnt realize you are kugal and havent eaten anything but nutrient slurry before
drago im trying to troll you and sis
you two like never get mad at me anymore
so gotta bring the zeal server personality to you guys
cause flubs not gonna lie
you seem to mellow down
what should i do then
ok imma just distill comedy into its purest form
<a:ponkclap:585600215822893066>
im innocent and pure <a:starlightwinkblep:587239549785079819>
why do you want us to be mad at you
nostalgic
these days it‚Äôs ‚Äúthats gummy to you‚Äù
im trying to get flubs mad at me
fuck if i know
damn it sis
that doesn't mean i'm omniscient
i have no clue what that word means sis
but i was joking, no one can know everything
not the gob
i dont know that
not glob
but only for knowledge
oh yeah i assume that sis
stop that
all right demon lord let's get this straight
im on my phone typing
trump is a literal stool sample
theres a big difference
trump instills existential dread
i'm just saying to pretend he's a real democrat is laughable
i wish he'd go away, yeah
thats just worse democracy
idk flubs
napoleon didn‚Äôt do everything thing
what the heck i never knew he was a pervert
that's when things will get exciting
they don't represent the diversity of the country at all
so i'm not 100% sure if there were any winners in that debate
i ignored the last few but i watched this one because the crowd's a bit thinner now
its more entertaining knowing that none of it will matter in as little as a week
sis sleep
the animal crossing direct i told you about and that was discussed last night in vc when demon lord was in the call
....
kiss was in vc ya know and she was fangirling over the invader zim voices
doesn't have alcohol
gummy thanks for dropping the animal crossing direct, i'm super excited for the game üòÑ
bringina, if you love your island, don't do it
no clue
gummy and nightshade do i even have you on switch
what the crap i thought you said you got one
gummy you're going to need one for a.c
nice!
well hurry it up then
or sis
best friends is a stupid concept
best friends exist?
mine abandoned me really dramatically, does that count?
im still waiting for the day bringy abandons me
idk that seems pretty dramatic
depends on the kind of cake
there is ice cream cake but im also hiding inside it. the abandonment was a ruse
otherwise all the pand shall be thrown into the ocean
its called mutually assured destruction and it's wonderful
museum is so pretty, the big aquarium? absolutely beautiful
ive always wondered if you could kill someone with a smoke bomb
<:ponkglock:644266129925341197>
well i can name a place or two thatd be better than others
which im currently not at
part of me wants to dig my 3ds out of the deep recesses of time just to play the mystery dungeon games that i didnt know existed
really confused about why the a button is only working in specific places though
it open again!!!
i just broke a hair comb while combing my hair üòÇ
flubs you break something
fine *breaks his own heart*
flubs
i got you a new pet
how sweet
blitz do you like the chicken, pig, or rat song?
i mean, that would help
ok this is great already
rip my sister for about the next 6 months?
rip my social life when animal crossing comes out that is if i can get it day 1
i know he would xd
where are you?
galarian transgender pokemon yessss
ordered a new headset today so i'll be able to join you guys again soon
join us soon in the gumlands as gummy freaking out
lol as long as it works that's all that matters to me
i want a nickname after watching a cartoon
snacks
awww
sagan wasn't even that old, that's just heartbreaking
same
hasn't been a good week for cats it seems
it's one thing when you know a cat is old and nearing the end but this was just way too soon
our little best friends being taken away at all is painful, especially when it is too soon
wrong channel, whoops
gummy and i pretty much pulled an all nighter we watched and did so much stuff
omg lmao
my favorite part of the night was making gummy suffer with pokemon black and white
wrong server
that is called natural selection flubs
blitz
and rn there's family drama, the type where family members declare they'll never speak to this family member ever again
and he decideds to call me to only tell me to tell my sister (who wont talk to him) to call him
so more like not very surprising but also im a bystander watching all this drama go down and i can't help but find it the least bit amusing
make a youtube series about it
it's amusing for blitz
and yea pretty much, and i dont wanna have that shit spread lmao cos it just exposes how fucked my family situation is lol
how old are you sis?
<:mordredthink:561981371279605771>
im not that surprised
oh yea i am
the day we got together i cried so fucking much lmao
well
okay now lets take a look
headset advice
sorry i'm watching a fire emblem stream right now lol
guys
it's a mix between snorlax and piplup
it's easy
what
i'm already yellow
worse than that
4chan related
thats the one
ill give you something yellow
please do
flubs
which are real words
so there's at least that
so they lied to me?
remember when i said a broken clock is right twice a day? that applies to uberfacts as well
take that flubs?
new plan
they should really call it ubertrivia
what you mean?
i think it looks interesting
what??
and how dare my influence isn‚Äôt working?
animal crossing!!
"several cutscenes will now be played in sequence"
so you have chosen.... death.
all in all: whoever created that menu belongs on a fucking cross
ah my food expert here
basically in simple terms: peanut butter, banana, and bacon milkshake
cause it‚Äôs good?
even sis can‚Äôt stop my milkshake addiction
no one can
<:rarithink:620106873110134794>
because gummy is cheaper than mr krabs
no demon lord
and the cables are making me suspicious
gummy where on earth did you even find that
magic drago
mario looks like a mexican - gummy
<a:ponksnapped:643691595614519297>
"always manage your textures properly. you don't want to end up like that guy, do you?"
guys
i just played games when my parents let me
sounds similar to me when i was 10ish
through naruto?
then i started to make accounts when i was 11ish
also gummy i will never understand you being proud of your own childish behavior
üëè üëè good job gummy
yes, through naruto fanfiction. "huh, naruto x sasuke... oh two guys can be together? thats new, okay"
because sis, why be ashamed of it? yeah it was stupid but if you think negative about it, it‚Äôs not gonna make you happy
if you think back and laugh about it, it cheers you up
....you know, that's actually a decent mindset
that's a skill you should probably put on your resume or something
just ask bringina, im very careful around making sure what she also wants instead of it always being me
gummy is high wisdom low intelligence character u see
is probably to constantly forget you do
it was bad
also that also taught me to plan ahead so thats why im planning super ahead with bringina now
also i remember when i drunk deleted my youtube channel, yeah i learn how to limit my alcohol intake to 1 drink every 1-3 months
and drago
you rang
that makes no sense
idk man i regret everything ive ever done im not an expert
psyduck is like pls help
i mean their trainer only wants it for the color of its skin of course it's uncomfortable
movie pizza
looks like meatballs
that was a great movie
even though it wasn‚Äôt a horror movie
if that pizza had a little bit more cheese, i'd say that looks fantastic af
you would be correct on that üòÇ
i mean sis i always wanted to know what your accent sounds like
at this point i feel like whatever we imagine ida's accent to sound like would automatically be funnier than whatever it actually is
eh i convince it similar to danish norwegian accent
cause danes sound like they're choking on potatoes
it was at bronycon
it was easy to understand, but i have some ability to understand most accents
think im going through a mini midlife crisis
my life is been the same lately
though some animal crossing and pokemon are making my life less boring
i mean no one really has everything figured out at 19
but it ain‚Äôt bad but feels like im like 50 years old
i used to have no idea what i wanted to do for short term goals but had an idea for long term goals
as long as youre happy, that's all that matters
and gummy, im sure you'll figure it out soon
that's kind of t be expected
lol well you're ahead of eyan at least
thats one
out of how many he finished?
the world simply isn't ready for his epicness
well it would be a restart since the old one was from like 2013
they still exist after all these years
he's been hyping it up for himself for 6 years now, that's almost a quarter of his entire life
yeah there's a few thaat haven't died from old age after the 80 years of waiting
like i said you have to be like ninja now
you gotta stream the big title games
some work out better than others
tbh i hate studying
and this might be ego ish
just to figure out how i can improve for next stream
we can collaborate on miitpoia
do dream together
dang i wish all of my rejections could come in the form of that
problem is im picky on who i want on stream
i already doubt my ability to sleep
streaming league is hard because i get pissy
like savage raids
i been studying some of them sis
yeah
people tend to stream the new content
it sounds confusing
like i have interest but it‚Äôs not enough currently
which could be either one but they seem to have gone with the same as trials now
and that's not how it works
there's 3 tanks, 6 healers, and 15 dps
the crystal tower series is at level 50, unlocked after the credits roll
some crafting maybe
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
and you could make a glamour
i'm fairly cheap too
a plushie of the pony oc made for me
i see
i think so
yes sis
~~wow she remembers~~
though i did promise nightshade an oc
i should actually get to work on that
get amd
not sure what else i'd have to frankenstein off though
fairly sure the 3600 actually draws less power than my current cpu too
but i rarely get anything for myself unless it's food or soda
oh god
barricade the doors and windows
can't sis, parents are coming as well
run away
or a sympathy discount
and for real for both you and drago, prob hop around in the house then leave 5 mins after
i can't sit still anywhere
fun thought experiment though
i did something amazing
did you get banned again?
my god that sounds gross
and it does imo
yea?
100% sure kiss ain't a skullkidfan thing prank cause she did a face reveal last night
there is this person that reminds me of skullkidfan in gummyland
so we weren't certain if this was a skullkidfan 2.0\
i drew this character
i was told to add a crown
butter oil
butter is better imo
for my striploin
so turn the darn thing around halfway through
thats kinda just an issue. if you dont care about presentation or one half being too cold, you could always chop it at the divide and cook the bad end some more
well i wanted a medium rare
1080p and hd?
thats a lot jeez
a broken clock usually just refers to one where the batteries died
this works well because battery can also refer to menacing or aggressive contact
sure why not
hey gummy
you mean dangaropa?
because i want to argue with you about it
spider man 2
i remember that
good job square (‡πë‚Ä¢Õà·¥ó‚Ä¢Õà)b
‚Äúkill yourself‚Äù
my dudes got a whole friggin arc
jesus is real
hey my dad told me to do that
thats also rude
he is
he often makes fun of religion
so then was the way of teaching the kids just the parents undermining what the other one says?
and dinosaurs are made up
and climate change cant be real bc the earth isnt real
he tells me
that scientist made the bones
and dug them up to make money
because he said if they were, then why can't we see them
also he believes and ghost and spirits are made up
but says trump will crush them
me too
> and dinosaurs are made up
let's be honest, that's his loss
i'm forever happy that i thought that in the shower one day and then later learned that other people who were actually smart had the same idea about dragons and dinosaurs
to be fair even the short ones
there have been people who made up dinos to become famous but those generally get uncovered as frauds and they're also violating dig site rules
it's the only thing that i've done with my life that's been even less profitable than youtube!
i just read his status thing
im pretty sure mine is still one of the boss songs from ebf3
my little sister just said ‚Äúi hope gummy dies to my dad‚Äù...
breaking the kneecaps is the american way not the canada way
now i just feel inadequate
pretty messed up because bernie is jewish
i don't think i would be against msnbc sacking him
im having actual pain
a ginger ale or something like that. a coke.
too bad i don‚Äôt have cola sis
healthy
hey gummy i found the problem
fuck veggies
ohh my stomach
and calling me a vegetable is incredibly rude
there are several possible responses i can think of this this conversation and they're all awful
im usually incredibly disappointed in the things i say here but that one made me a little proud
im not sick to where i cannot work
besides new horizons, what should i get, i can only choose one. new super mario bros u deluxe, super mario maker 2, pokemon sword/shield, mario kart 8, pokemon mystery dungeon dx
nor mario maker
if you have someone irl to play with, then nsmbu is a good choice
i don‚Äôt sadly
and there's an unlimited amount of it in mario maker
i guess dx in that case
i definitely want it for collection
i say dx or sword and shield
did u play mario kart on the wii u
out of all options
dx and mario maker are highest
yeah mario maker is a much better value for money than new super mario bros. u
mario kart 8 it is
personally i think dx is the better choice now that i think about it because everyone i know wants to pick it up
you sounded fine two days ago
huh guess it's the alternative spelling so it was spelled right
them and the guardian are the big (international) ones from uk
whyd you have to go and say that
also after watching a film
drago is main protagonist
i was the protagonist who stayed whole to nap
they still can't even pass the green new deal in congress let alone something like that
imma blow up the fuckin sun and replace it with a robosun
give the nation 7 more months
i found something
and then like a bunch of the supreme court people die so we can flip that too
if bernie gets in that means that enough of the nation supported him and he can continue to rally that populist base to put a lot of pressure on congress
they'll end up giving it to bloomberg if bernie doesn't get an absolute majority of delegates
if bloomberg is president good god we are screwed
god why do we suck
bread and circus
you don't think everyone in america wants the nation to end at this point we have fallen off the grid
no i think my dad is still enjoying it
i mean if america _actually_ ends the rest of the world's not going to have a fun time either, because globalism
gummy calm down at least you don't have an orange man who gropes woman as president
i want russia to be like the russian empire again
if russia ended i'd be pretty happy
references: am chinese
by ending
because it's japan u can do anything in that country
japan culture is better than america
just look at japan after world war ii and japan today
they need an emperor
they'd pick japan
mitch that's like asking the people who cut gym class every day if they approve of gym class
only until they realize anime wasn't a thing in the 40s
just a bit
i do believe shinzo abe is liberal
i mostly mean towards lgbt stuff and feminism
i remember in 2016 when he dressed up as mario during the summer olympics closing cermony lol
i dare donald trump to do that
i would do that
usa needs an enlightened monarch
one who accepts change
and has the power to make good chnages
haha he could still get worse, just kidding
since canada police arrested many today
imagine trump dressing up as mario lol
he‚Äôs mexican
i have a feeling obama would have done that if you asked him nicely
don't think so
i believe we had one in canada for a very short time
oooo lesbian prime minister
if buttigeg somehow wins i'll be happy because it'll make the conservatives spontaneously combust, but also i'm not the biggest fan of buttigeg so urgh
thats like the universal consensus drago
i'm content to wait for next go-round for an openly gay president
of course if he does win we'd continue to tradition of collecting one of every kind of president
lori lightfoot sounds like a dnd character name
some right is needed
i don't really see any point to the right
trickle down = give money to rich people so they can spend it and eventually some of it will make its way to the not-rich people
makes our nation feel like a prison and isolates it
thats why it needs to be fix
there's not much you can do about that
what are u gonna do cavity search everyone that comes in
by doing things like, for example, actually doing things with peoples' immigration papers that don't involve filing the away for the rest of eternity
borders would have done nothing to help
no the last major terrorist attack was by a white guy with an ar-15
i would make a simple policy
you don‚Äôt mess with ours
pick a mass shooting, any mass shooting :(
we gotta just eliminate the southern states and gun control is fixed
how dare you!
what are those reasons?
lets all move to errr
jeff van drew: lemme switch parties because it would get me elected
they are a republic
crazy part is people would prob accept an american monarchy
k bye night
just live in the pokemon center only problem is that's considered illegal
just left zeal
people in zeal gettin gyou down?
do i need to yell at someone?
i mean being in that server is like guilt on my shoulders too
no gummy but there is massive game stores
so no one pissed you off?
i was pissed but not at anyone
if anything you kept it off of life support
though one question
well it's not even necessarily the president who creates jobs
he's more or less taking credit for what obama did after the great recession
the one thing he hasn't tried to actively dismantle
and those tax cuts trump passed have not in any way helped the middle class like he claims
to what you said earlier
because "don't be annoying" isn't a rule on the books, as you might have noticed
i found a career for you
"supergummying: he could have been worse. 3 / 10"
i love this show
god damn it now someone's going to have to destroy that also
drago i will destroy your channel!
both of us, probably
thank god you quit sis
groan
also drago
good
you said i sucked at pokemon
i will kill that bot
i don't think i would recommend doing it right now
nintendo stocks!
you're going to laugh but that was the first thing i invested in
we are watching a vid on the history of coffee in class
i think this is false?
not surprising
yeah we were forced to take a christian test in grade 7
i went to catholic elementary and middle school, we had religion class
it was
it was a public school with no religion
fuck
though i did create a channel solely to upload twitch vods
2 years?
actually you were mentioned briefly by aqua
i don't know what else i can say really, he's a teenager so there's that
true
probably
also
i was mentioned
let me guess probably negative
it was more just a general acknowledgement
no, who is gummyv
i must have missed that
i mean
<:ponkohyouknow:525081375888506883>
what does that word mean?
alternately: sufficient, enough
also drago
so im used to their names from the cartoons
there you are
do this to charlie
oh my god
lmfao charlie would like that
i think i have a picture of charlie out and about in the snow just getting covered up
two out of two vets agree
does flubs agree though?
ooo drago
watch this one
god damn it gohan
i never even heard him howl much
the internet was a mistake
mitch it's not nice to dare people to kill themselves
actually taht sounds kinda like a frat party
ngl sometimes i do wish pok√©mon was still a small ("small") game made by a team of 30 people
ok so you're echoing me basically
so i guess that's why i haven't liked the games since b2w2
like there were fewer pokemon but didnt black and white do that to?
it's a benedict cumberbatch photoshopped image i think
yeah its not like you play the games for the story
the sheep just kinda hop (heh) in place? and then use the elements to fucking murder eldritch horrors from the earth's past
flubs that's literally how all of my gym battles in sword went
sheep butts
you knew i was pinning that, come on
the why i need to see it
...out the butt?
humans generally lay on their backs to make it more like a shit chair if anything
mitch i take it you've never conversed with flubs before
shush mitch
also i'm gonna go sleep on this wonderful note
i was more saying that because kugal doesnt really need to know
so i need to work on that
because kugal does too many crimes
we talked abou this already
if theres a set amount of gay*crimes, if you commit no crimes or do no gay then it breaks down
that's not an option, it has to be one or the other
me me m
lpt: dont rob the bank, its dangerous and gives you little money. work for the bank and just embezzle and shit
he fuckin flipped it on me
i've got exactly $0.50 on my desk
not counting my wallet
ok fine
i dont have one to take
never stop doing that
cause the theme before was errr
or something like that
~~yes~~
get mitch to
kugal wanna talk about matrix multiplication?
pokeball plush included
whats the expression?
so i know how to use it for 3d graphics and i know (kind of) how to do it, but i don't exactly see the actual connection between matrix math and 3d graphics
bringina you have my full support on this mission
you should both get drunk, it gives you an alibi.
here's piplup anyway
talking about this penguin
gummy i want that thing to burn, and when it's done burning i want the ashes to burn
lmfao
drago i've been practicing
gummy it's you versus literally the entire rest of the planet
probably one of my fav straters
i do believe gen 5 you hate tepig
only thing i'm prob gonna hate about sinnoh remakes is i'm gonna have to constantly look at what pokemon to catch to use as a hm slave lol
that is my plan to pick piplup as my starter and gummy is prob gonna mop the floor with me cause he felt like flexing that he's beaten the game 10 times lol
technically 20 mitch
i like grundle
it would be kind of funny if the remakes eliminate the whole hm thing entirely
i wouldnt hate that
no both
i feel like the surf replacement in swsh should have killed the user instantly
i actually didn't except flubs to be the first person i ever met who agreed with me on hms, but hey
at this point i'm pretty sure hms are a losing battle though, if i want field moves i'll play zelda or something
hey man i expected if people wanted to be horny theyd play zelda but a friend showed me some disturbing stuff recently that proved me wrong. they still play pokemon.
yikes!
on vhs
i always have to have one open whenever i do raids
itd be so easy to remember
someone prob has the brain of a math god while also knowing all the pokemon type advantages and disadvantages while also knowing how to speak a million languages
we'd just have normal for the wooloo
i mean i know all of th epok√©.mon matchups, i just dont do the other things
isnt rotom like every type or something
if it's not gonna be sanders the next best choice would have to be biden
riots all over the place
biden has to win south carolina if he's gonna get that far though, not to mention super tuesday
is he the one where theres the audio file of him asking for pants with more dick room
mostly just boring stuff
give that audio a listen. really intriguing
literally just the president of the us asking for pants with more dick room
actually i take back my statement on not viewing any of the conventions in 2016 cause i remember trump's current lawyer was pretty much hyping up the crowd
targeted attack jeez
made the bitch pika cry
i gotta cuddle those cute bois
gummy called pikachu a bitch wtf is this
piplup is a bigger bitch though
omg lol
i love birbs
so blitz
are you ready to be mean?
blitz imma teach you to be mean
can i buy drugs from you?
no lol
gummy let's meet up and eat some hot wings
a gummy and bringina destroying a country movie
knew you were gonna say that lmao
charlie day
im not gonna take an axe to a desk
um aggressiveness...
gummy online
tom nook for president
the teacher of that class loves me, so her, my boyfriend, and like 5 other students came to defend me
the teacher told us to choose from the answer choices a or b
the teacher said "ok now discuss with someone who chose your answer too why you chose your answer"
and then i said "ah yes, because c stands for 'can't create cool complicated conversations (with other students but sorry i couldn't come up with more words that start with c)'"
and i just ignored them because they are on another level of idiotic, i seriously abhor some students at my school lmao
what you do
go to pax east
i didn't see it i just now heard about it and there must have been a conference earlier today that said the virus wasn't a big deal so that's why trump gave the speech
once it gets to 100k infected we can officially use this plagues inc style map
this virus reminds me of the black death
and it started with rat fleas
well at least you got that right
im in position
we only learned recently that rat fleas were the reason, didn't we?
yes sis
they believe it started in china where rats would then infect traders who would trade with europeans
fuck
which would slow down the virus
hello my fellow gamer
see what happens
but okay i‚Äôll say the n word
sis you are a nerd
sis you are a noob
<:pinkie_awkward_smile:636655055134785558>
idk who that is
our usa president everyone
is getting people to buy his bullshit
i found out elections in other countries are shorter than ones in the usa with canada being 3 weeks and japan being 13 days
where we arent electing the president yet but doing all the setup for that
bring back the monarchy!
japan elections go by so quick your like nani
its all about theater here
although the usa doesn't really have an official one
like the second half of the ceremony should be people announcing theyre running
canada sounds about right
last time people were lining up and walking to canada
i say let them all freeze
just heard from one of my co workers
aw sorry man
i heard another guy passed away from cancer but i didn‚Äôt even know him as well as this dude
also my headset arrived today
do it flubs
can i trade myself in?
but i like sword
i meant june 2019
i don‚Äôt want the switch
and mitch
i‚Äôll take flubs with me
disgusting
gummy against the world
yeah gummy cant stop time
i meant friday
what's going on this friday
bringina and gummy shall finish what stormfall drizzle and supergummying started on friday
no one knows what that means...?
i happy
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
oh she is cute
whew
damn it, she says don‚Äôt come to russia, but i always wanted to see the russian empire
youre a bit late for that
yea pretty much
flubs no
yea agreed. however his justification for doing it that way was that he teaches like 6 courses a semester, and his hw pile is ginormous, and he's 60 and he's getting more tired as time rolls on
but russia has a government well known for taking the sentiments of the people to heart
anyways back to the e3 joke
yeah
i complain about new jersey a lot but even in proto-redneck-country-jersey you probably won't have a bottle broken over your head just for being gay
true
sadly russia isn‚Äôt as big as it once was
no come back i didnt mean it
night sis! *hugs*
but mitch
hey gummy are you looking forward to april fools day this year?
idk theyll probably announce it at e3 or something
oh seems like corphish is heading to e3
cause corphish
look at his motherboard
for my latest hw assignment i kinda went balls out
and for 2 of them, i knew the answer but my justification for my answers were literally just proofs
build it
while i had 236 subs
i knew him when he had 55 and was annoying :p
lmfao, i'd totally do that proof though
i wish i could remember what the question was
im almost 20
i hate him for making me feel old
stop being almost 20
it definitely works like that
it definitely works like that
he doesn‚Äôt even need it now
i mean
yeah i'm scrolling down now, that was just the first thing i saw lol
what did happen to some of eyan‚Äôs fanbase?
the switch has turned on and i no longer remember why i plugged it in
i gotta add y'all on switch lol
agreed lol
yeah so are 320,000,000 other americans
i mean the numbers are probably off but that sentiment is true
no he isnt
ash for president
same thing for vice president then?
and i feel like i heard there are different ways to make an rng so theyre all different
he's seeding the lottery with the social security number of the previous winner
we have different definitions of "seeding" something i think
youve just killed america
possible
see thing is a lot of americans wont understand that so it wont be implemented. new things have to be easy and similar to old things or they wont be liked
oh right
kiss told me to post this
though once again i don't take this family/sibling/twin thing seriously unless it's sis
or even actual person
are you referring to ke- [drago has died of suicide by a bullet wound in the back of his head]
it went from a joke to a serious matter
and sis would be disappointed i bs an answer about icelandic canadians
i said some thing was a cake
and i have to take a canadian history
gummy what did you do
japan has had to cancel anime and gaming conventions so if those have been getting hit i don't see why olympics wouldn't
i like it still
you sounded a lot crazier back then imo
and i already hit puberty by that vid
i see
and i still do
how dare they
also mitch what if they don't do remakes?
then the sinnoh fandom will be sad
i mean it's still sinnoh
why do you enjoy that episode so much then xd
this was the video i was talking about when we watched that episode lol
i will burn you and the turtle
get me into this chat room
flubs burn him
oay blitz
drago
demon lord
where are you?
i think i have a small form of ptsd?
not surprising
yeah i think i kinda have that
doesn‚Äôt work at all
i cant even tell if gummy is being serious or not at this point
but gums doesn‚Äôt wanna make mood bad
and he doesn‚Äôt want people to feel bad for him, cause thats bad
goes to walmart which there was a closer walmart
and tries to get me to buy it
well that was a waste of time
usually the insults are worse
he can smite people at will but not viruses
sounds like an idea
ohhh i hope the next pope is a lady that'd be cool
austria*
they have good coffee there
italy it ww2 is just sad, austria was jerks i thinj
ww2 bad
i mean ww1 was bound to happened because tensions
also had black racism issues as well
okay flubs
i have no clue
imma get a rat to beat you up
i like this music
this is pretty good
buuny needs his happy meal
almost 4 fucking years
but at 6 am
beat sun and moon
thanks sis
why you up so early?
it's more a challenge of willpower than actually being good at it
and yes that fucking snorlax killed me
i can't sleep because i'm in pain
my throat
drop things?
i'm sipping some tea rn
pokemon moon is helping me a bit with ptsd and my mid life crisis
i know, but i feel like i am
i mean all i do is go to work, school, home and repeat
nothing interesting happens anymore
years but im finally done, reminds me when i was 16 now almost 20
but night sis! (but this time, i‚Äôm the one going to bed)
drago
after 3-4 years drago
too bad i don‚Äôt have the vids anymore
i think i need another round of olive oil in my ear
sounds fun cause lillie is precious
episode 46!!!!
then i was stupid saying that
then delete the vids but oh well
gummy you have an interetsing concept of "effort"
i was still under the impression of "a month or two" lmao
i feel like it would be a very educational experience for gummy
<a:pawnk:680050332889645108>
gums is a salty marshmallow
it's about robot butts with a side of post-human existential dread and light hack-and-slash mechanics
i don‚Äôt like butts
nier automata is about butts
sylveon is number 6
sylveon is bad and should feel bad
if anyone meaning prob just demon lord wondering about stream
pokemon has been cancelled due to bringina feeling a bit ill
bringina stop feeling ill
bringy use a potion
shut the fuck up
peal is my favorite game
a peal of a diamond
cause fnatic
yeah
correct
her husband came after me
cause she told me in the dream i got her pregnant
i see
the consequences without the fun
time to stream
won't be there today, this has been a week from hell and i just need it to be over
oh this thing got here quickly.
cheap
i should probably make sure it works before i do anything else
i really like the brick aesthetic
don‚Äôt waste money
i should get one for my father so he can stop playing ps4 and screaming at cod lol
i gotta help starlight probably buy another new pc
1990: kids screaming at the video games
2020: parent screaming at the video games
good
he even said that this is his 10 times saying that
buuuuuuuuuut, i should probably bookmark that one \*just in case\*
permanently?
oh nice
so once they run out of kat capture cards
if i absolutely have to i'll just emulate gba stuff instead of recording it off actual hardware
it's the only way i was able to learn to program thouh
it's so user friendly anyone can
brb trying something on kelly
he speaks javascript
you're giving me hilarious powers drago
gummy your traffic lights are tilted
and im at work so im not texting and driving
good gummy
no distracted driving
they're fun if you're the one wielding them
never dealth with ruby either
probably
and then i used it for two pok√©mon fan games and slightly-less-than-hated it
i approve
wait that means i might be leading the charge
can probably pilfer textures from existing things though
a darn book
your life is to be around gummy like everyone else
cause gums has no life
also that new guy in zeal has died already, no surprise there
also brb
the markets are plunging
how long do you recommend
and then learning shit through days at his office
whats the lowest i can invest?
how many men must fail for every buffet to succeed
my co worker was talking to me about ut
it's also going to be in free fall for a little while, so don't buy anything now
now? the world is your oyster
i may have already known that though
any tips
okay but like, that's not in my nature lmao
good answer kugal cant have them knowing about our dish sessions
or left politics?
i am
me too
i might just slowly break away from them once hs ends
im an adult
if i cut them off now, when i fly to vegas for grad, they will 100% confront me about it
and it'll be awkward
she is a bitch
oh it‚Äôs a she
my bf and i are in a server with her and she always makes us feel bad for interacting together because we're forcing others to "third wheel" yet when she interacts with her bf in there it's 100% fine
ah, double standards
it's never a good idea mentally to wait if someone is getting to you, i realize it may be awkward at grad but you gotta think about you're feeling right now
i think i will
i will do this 100%
and it broke his heart, so i think we need to separate fromt hem
delightful person
dewit
oh yeah eyan's quotes are global
fuck yeah
oh hey
ash talk
gasp
your life was complete when you made ash. why did you continue?
i left zeal
seems like gumland makes you happy then
this server, though i cant talk here a much, still makes me super happy
okay i feel like shit after that chug
cause gums smart with server
unlike original camelot
im pretty sure people enjoy the political talk and news
plus i can be stupid all i want
politics is just a great source of entertainment
so you've stated you're a monarchist, but how do you lean on most other topics?
when you throw jsfuck into jsfuck
depends master
what are they?
i am a monarchist, thats no joke
you can go by the form in the channel description or you can go through the full 100 axis
it should take mayb half an hour
how far did you get?
i just started undoing the knot on the friendship
i'll talk when im more rational and when im in a better mood
it was nice knowing you all
i think my favorite things so far was learning about linear independence and invertible matrices, and theorems for determinants
which is amusing because matrix math is like 80% of computer graphics
which makes a lot of sense
i love partial derivatives
have you got to the chain rule yet with partial derivatives?
no kugal i was counting on you :(
i dont want to just send it here bc it be lonnnnnggggggg
here are my gay and my crimes sorry for how long it is :\(
those are all woke as shit
master pls dont make me a communist i like my money
gummy is a monarcho communist
no master
master this is a bad video he says "right" while gesturing left
alright?
i am a god in a world of ants
therefore in spite of the contrary contrapositive cross product i must denounce this line of reasoning
we can all pretend democracy matters but when the nuclear winter comes we will revert to dictatorships and feudal societies and theres nothing anyone can do to stop it
yay?
burn down berlin!
the great thing is that when chaos comes everyone thinks they'll be the king on top and welcome it for that
i welcome the entertainment
i will start a diamond and pearl walkthrough
don‚Äôt wanna delete pearl
i have pirate diamond which is bad
i want to save platinum for bringy and me
for nostalgia
wonder how long it would take u to finish x or y in a day
how will you beat that?
wait you can watch me
diamond and pearl would be cool
since you have a button where you can speed the game if you want
but i think thats against the rules
i have to maybe buy starlight a new onw
the store used to be less horny
yeah but not in this sad of a manner jesus christ
can i be part of the horny gang
join the lonely gang. horny gang is stupid
im alone a lot but i feel surrounded by lovely people
save some of it for the rest of us jeez
i didnt realize other people got to weigh in on that
he thinks it's a sin
yes he does
way i see it, if being gay is a sin its just popular to get its own hell
see that was always my theory about heaven
no seriously
yes sis, right away sis
sis why are you up?!
also pls be careful, the virus has spread to iceland
lots of loud
or just shoots you
i might not get into bed then
fuck
but it takes away time from me to talk to my guy
flubs why are you up
not that
i feel horrible for my inability to wake up
i think i need to get intot he habit of throwing myself out of bed, and sitting up right as my alarm goes off
yeah
so i can get homework done, get ready for the day, exercise, go to class, complete more homework, talk with friends, and then sleep
i exercise for like 3 hours a day
do homework early?
have a skip day for exercise
and get more sleep?
at 4:45
idk how i sleep
this is amazing
kinda similar to how bringina and gums have each other's back all the time
here is my friend's doggo again, riley, cosplaying as a bun
the cat is like a mom telling you to sleep cause it's a school night
well i do have an exam starting in 7 hours
oh fuck
oh my god kugal
yeah i sent it when i said u should do a pokemon spicy food challenge and what inspired me to propose the challenge lol
whaaat u sent girls und panzer content
i like to imagine that's how bernie sanders would get out of a situation like that
guys corona is a hoax
huh how bout that
i knew it was fake
fuck the unions, get borders or some shit
us presences is gone
imma write a book about it
then we would know your full name lol
fuck
i don't find it irritating when you guys talk btw, feel free to talk about whatever you want whenever, but they tire me and make me feel inadequate
in other news i'm currently having existential dread over bloomberg seeing any level of success at all
also even though i lean left, i don't like bernie sanders and while he would definitely be better than trump, i don't think he deserves to be president
i get his time on earth is numbered but he seems to be the only one who wants to take on healthcare
even if his mind is there (maybe) being president is a hard job
the voter is just at a war over putting somebody who can beat trump vs someone who agrees with them
the probability of somebody being worse than trump is very far off honestly
bloomberg might be the worse one nvm
ida when i say young i mean "not my grandma's age"
~~michelle obama 2024~~
willingly
i think most people would
i'm curious to see how nuts the republican party will be in terms of elect choices in 2024
i mean in terms of running cause he may want to after trying in 16
yes sis...
you and god must have some connection
well you always have close calls with death
i know
i did something stupid
after you use it
now im sitting in pain
oh so its a fuckin bail
my arms
walmart is whatever though
how many people even carry around dollar coins though
wait people use shopping carts?
(it's uphill too)
i'm hoping one of the other moderate candidates drops out tonight
they won't have a shot now
mitch soon
also this week is rough for like everyone at cableas
co worker died
i liked pete until he started roasting people for no reason
but i wanna see him rap the usa problems away
it turns out there's more stuff for him to destroy than he thought
we get slightly more say than the us virgin islands
i would be kinda sad if amy drops out but it's very likely
democratic national convention in the summer
i don't see trump changing vice presidents
the only woman to hold office in canada is crazy as fuck
regardless if it's biden or sanders, i think they would be smart to pick kamala harris
that's my hope anyway
and in bernie's case it may be good for him to have a more moderate running mate
yeah
how much does the average gummy fucking swears?
does it count the amount of times i think to myself "fucking shit" whenever i see anything in my inbox?
a baby swears at flubs
i guess punch, not kick. but you get the spirit
and sis said i was violent and evil
so suddenly decking a child is "evil"
kids are evil, they deserved it
he was undying people and stuff tho
good job argo
thonk
seems like 1.5 instances
ok something is off
you ever wonder what counts as asking for too much?
e!bot
there it is
e!bot
e!bot
e!bot
because it's 7:46 pm
i forgot the second i called you
glad i could help :\)
im not quite sure im still trying to figure that out
or imaginary
oh ok great
they should just give it back to cartoon network
he destroyed them. oh god
drago, how?
wait i wanna hear lewd joke
the lewder the better
we should probably stop talking about skarm now
what if youre the new guy?
more training is needed
i am skarm
i know
everyone knows this
how the fuck do they poo
bc thats the place poo comes out so if they dont got it where the fuck does the poo come out
he is winning and winning
i'd rather have someone who can beat trump than someone who agrees with me
it's pretty much biden vs sanders not sure why warren is still going but ok
dad: "i hope warren stays in the race and keeps siphoning votes from sanders"
that
obama just needs a wig and some male skin moisturizer
is it? what does it taste like? my world currenly tastes like the week-old mystery meat from the school cafeteria
for me it was theodore roosevelt
i don't think putin can run next election
bollocks i'm out of incense
what *are* bollocks, anyway
theyre the bits inside the dangly thing beneath the dong
science!
its actually both
because i do
dragonitespam vs supergummying
blitz
charlie would lose
but charlie is tough
no he is a wuss
some actual good news in politics mike bloomberg is dropping out
nice
mustton not now
yeah that's about how i feel too
i‚Äôll get back in the swing of that game once i get my life in check
was it a good idea that i shorten my name from supergummying or do you guys strangely prefer supergummying?
was there something wrong with supergummying?
was there anything _not_ wrong with supergummying?
flubs ask drago
first off, the one you'll come to know during your travels around limsa lominsa
y'shtola rhul
smart and sassy, big fan favorite
next up, the one drago may have encountered
it's been a long time since i did the ul'dah starting quests
papalymo's the brains of the duo, yda's the ditz who can punch stuff well
the moogle does nothing as it's just there for that image
balloons?
that animal thing sis
it's
that's its pom
i don't think we do though
it just means we are always on daylight savings time, and that we don‚Äôt change the clock back
i finally did it
yes im perfectly sane
don‚Äôt judge me
now the supergummying name is officially gone on youtube
what is this?
sounds church medieval
it's a realm reborn's theme
there's these stages called the coils of bahamut that are split into 3 parts
scary
that's the guy that nuked eorzea
at your pace it'll be 12 years
are you calling me slow?!
epic
well so far it looks like reviews for mystery dungeon are mixed
yeah but dont they usually explain them?
or are those not out yet?
i feel like they will
yeah
i cant tell if thats a threat tbh
did she? i thought ida was the only person i told to harass you
ngl i'm probably top three in the list of eyan twitch regulars of all time
thats fuckin crazy
third batch would be us along with rainy, rc, squid, and anyone else in zeal server or was at least around when it first started
man thats a huge change
but man the forums changed a lot
if change is inevitable then that will one day change and change will become impossible
to be fair ash rained hell there too
i mean anthony‚Äôs gang almost got in
and they did get in here
time to write something in the chat
i got news
oh yea i found out about that when i woke up
i'm curious to see who she's gonna endorse
it's just nuts that the most diverse list of candidates now boils down to two old white men
they worry the young will party and do nothing
obama
people
hot coffee it is
hi sebastian
shoot back "stop making idiocy political"
no becasue you're incompetent
i do not mitch
i just said power from god so people can't argue with me
um first would be
lgbtq rights even though canada already has that
so bernie
yes you can be anti abortion but pro choice
i do believe biden wants the 15 dollar wage
i am against it but i don't give a fuck about what you do
reduce greenhouse gases
dismantle the electoral college and maybe modify the senate and house
instead of putting addicted people in jail
as for international stuff
america
for dixieland!
this
i fucked up
sing this everyday
argo my sister and i have began adapting that song to be about our dog
meanwhile
i adapted that song for stacking obsolete computers in the surplus pile
shall i direct him to the zeal server master?
wonder if i have a general emote
i got this idea from rarity art and kingcorphish‚Äôs profile pic
basically my me as my oc, and well what do you guys think?
they had a thing where they would evict people from safehouses for being trans
that was decisive
technically 9 years in na/eu
remember the days when you had to wait months for a game to be localized from japanese to english?
guys
which is better?
freaky?
argh
we are not friends anymore!
whos peter?
dunno
in my pc
i found out that i had recorded a video of me playing league in 2015
so i guess i was playing league while watching eyan and recording?
it's not
it's not embarrassing
cause it was only my gameplay
how dare you!
that is so me
what you think sis?
look at then
how dare you call her creepy
i have been officially offered and accepted part time permanently at my workplace!!!
neat
nice work gums!
fuck that
fool
amd or nvidia?
i also need to buy um
i guess maybe another ssd
<:cozynotevil:585599397954322453>
no and no
also how to properly ignore you without letting on that im ignoring you
flubs i looked back at my dms
i clearly told you i got banned
idk how you haven‚Äôt left gumland left
it‚Äôs ponies
i just dont look at it
if that
tbh it‚Äôs been less ponies lately since show ended
back in zeal server you were there when 20 people talked
now ive got hobbies and stuff. reading, putting blood in my system from my bones, that stuff
yeah but i dont like vc as much since i cant talk
woah
i want in on the blood hobby
youre doin it right now man
at least i hope
start of original skype group
i do respect you guys will call me out on my shit
i don‚Äôt like t
fuck i don‚Äôt remember how to spell it
kiera
i used to be like that
i am gummy
im not smart enough to know if thats healthy or not but my gut says no
im gummy not eric
bringy
yeah
because she brought a friend over
irl and online me are the same
i think its more common to not be that different online. im just weird
for the rest of you...
yeah but itd be violent
not drago
seriously, what a guy
every time he talks it just brightens your day, y'know?
but let's playing is kind of dying anyway so yeah
demon lord let's plays aren't going to die until i say they can die
lol fair
talking about kugal when he's not reading the chat is kinda pointless
it'll be like vods but maybe a bit more compressed or something
nah man we should always talk about kugal
now he's going to want to be unduly nice to everyone >:(
and i'm just kind of here, i don't know why lol
everyone here is rad as shit
drago^. 5
something something theta times one-eighty over pi
earlier today i think it was
alright here it is
this is why nerds have the best jokes
why is no one a suck up to me?
but english majors are nerds too
hence its racist
be loyal to me
and you get this
i get it
it‚Äôs not that hard
doesn't have to be anything too fancy
maybe
but he does genuinely seem to want to do something with his community
would be uploading
they're the ones that matter at this point
streams and videos
same sis
yeah i don't blame you there
also probably making camelot/gummyland may have made the other community harder...
eh it was bound it happened sooner or later, i always had the revive camelot plan in my head
but anyways demon lord
the secret to success in zeal server is have that one active person
i don't know who else could pull that off though
flubs
but for me
like when i talked about ash getting a kiss from serena
someone who i shall not name then said it was something i‚Äôll never get
also he won‚Äôt get in trouble cause it‚Äôs been over two years
he only claim i dated someone in the server when i did not
gummy is roughly equal to one $60 video game
hopefully i can finish it before animal crossing comes out
im working on new horizons plans
i wanna see gummy unbox something for some reason
i could send him a horse head in the mail as a threat
he even voice cracks in the intro
wh*a*ts up kiddies
gummy how does it feel knowing the only time ive really visited your channel(s) was to delete them
i'm still binging drago's sun and moon let's play lol
which flubs
for some weird reason i find his commentary relaxing
also mitch i can vc you soon
i mean it‚Äôs not lazy to hang around with me?
man i gotta go from over here to click on the stream and pause the thing im doin and then stay engaged bc i like talkin and blah blah blah
you are lazy
>  i'm still binging drago's sun and moon let's play lol
why lol
because you said my stream was good
"awoo" -charlie, when asked about his thoughts on gummy
take a video and ask him
wait he disappeared?
he's probably outside sleepin on his bed
welp
that would put you somewhere around 11 am on december 30
what else is new
oh guys
it sucks and i hate it
i know you all don‚Äôt watch my streams  but is it bad or good that i keep a stormy profile pic somewhere on the overlay?
well ex gf since we weren‚Äôt dating at the time but yeah since she did get me into streaming
thanks guys
im trying to promote bacon
early morning roast
i would forget an email and password after 1 hour?
there is now a third hand sticking out of my butt
maybe
is corona that bad in australia
i don't think toilet papeer is even gonna help
i've seen conspiracies from the kids were props , adam lanza not even existing and even the school never even existing
flubs shut up, birds are divine beings and you know it >:^(
i could make a few different jokes about having a third hand sticking out of my butt and they're all in varying degrees of poor taste
drago the government hasnt been based off of a mandate of heaven for like 30 years man
theyre just watching us from on high, mocking us mortals for making such a spectacular mess of everything
