okay skarm say something now
the only gold level tool you really need is the pick.

okay skarm say something again
    go into the control center and switch outputs
when we're bored and want to look up funny skarm reactions
    he gets a head-start_pokes skarm with a spatula_
    _noms chaos_
_pokes skarm with another spatula_
    _puts flubs in detention_
I wonder if Skarm is passing its finals
    to my family breakfast is another time to eat and doesnt deserve special foods just for itself
Must be one difficult final for birdbrain school
    test
Chill skarm it's just a bit of terminology
    skarm quote it
okay, skarm. fourth wall humor is starting to get old now
    England doesn't have a kidney bank, but it does have a Liverpool.
wondering when someone else will encounter the skarm command's effect
    well the "ryzen 1600" is specifically the cpu of said computer.
Get Flubs some allergy meds, Skarm
    tl;dr nothing should exist and java sucks
I don't think skarm is listening
    enchanted with soul stealing whatsitcalled
sadly, skarm is still alive
    back in albany he was teaching dance for 50-60 hours per week
Yeah, I think either Master may have botched or something glitched with skarm
    It should've been Gummy.
Gummy tried to trigger the message with <:HelloThere:305560404715896832> and skarm didn't pop up with a message
    e!google dovahzul translator
so skarm doesn't mention gummy when he uses hello there
    darn
skarm is very misunderstood
    hoover is a pretty funny name
_sends skarm after bella_
    *is poptat a pasta*
And Skarm is being weird again
    i actually just had the biggest self debate for ice cream
*throws Skarm out the window for reminding me of that*
    _force chokes squid again_
How is Skarm choking me good?
    sprinklers and scarecrows
I’m used to Skarm being violent
    hg/ss is so expensive. a new copy is $799
*switches places with Skarm*
    *doesn’t flail around*
*throws Skarm with a math book at Majestic*
    *bassoons gummy into a windchime*
skarm has his own grammar rules apparently
    don't break my own chat rules? i know right?
skarm is always watching and finding decent to stupid quotes to record. That's basically how it goes
    no keep watching my dude
Because Skarm dropped green paint there
    i can’t even say one of the cheeses i like because it’s spanish <:lul:305559915714576385>
*slaps skarm* YOU IDIOT
    details, details
i have a new idea for skarm
    if it's what you prefer, then i'll start using it.
to make skarm play skyrim?
    lol
<@!162952008712716288> what are you doing to skarm
    also you gotta love that olympic theme
this will reduce the memes per line coming out of skarm
    a bit of both?
So, what did you do to Skarm?
    just reaffirming
senate was not mentioned yet, skarm
    this doesn't help me! this situation sucks
*throws science at skarm*
    _pokes .jar files with a stick and hears a loud explosion from under his desk_
skarm how many times to i have to tell you it's `jar -xf file` not `jar -fuckyou file`
    the battle is starting soon
Go back to bed Skarm
    yeah i was trying to make it not sound lewd
*gives the broken rock to Skarm*
    *sets under the floor on fire*
Something tells me he doesn't want to be a teacher after what I put him through with skarm
    no, you can't
And I'm using a Skarmory
    oh crap my twitter likes has been crazy recently
Anyways time to catch a female Skarmory since I can't be assed to SR for the right fossil
    what rhymes with orange?
and Skarm, good attempt at contributing to the convo
    brb adding steam group to bot logs
*throws Skarm at Draco*
    *noms cake*
*catches Skarm and sets it down gently*
    _goes back to lurking around _
What do you have to say about this, birdbrain?
    kappa
*throws Skarm at Flubs to help make his job interesting*
    _pokes squid with gummy_
i love how i keep getting pings from skarm every time you lot say "dragon"
    the formula was n² + n - 1
*throws Skarm at technology failures*
    *puts rc’s door back before he finds out and hits me with it*
um, skarm why did you take my door?
    this isn't share your sidebar day
damn skarm didnt learn that
    i am a gf of one, sadly
Dragonite, are you actually trying to find more ways for skarm to murder squid
    what is it currently where you live?
I'm not telling you anything, birdbrain
    i feel very isolated right now
yeah, that one asshole who skarm keeps killing
    everyone sucked
Or I can just blame Skarm and move on
    is because disney owns them
*makes Skarm rip Dragonite’s hair out because he thinks it’s fun*
    *blows up squid*
*makes Skarm do something loud*
    *should*
okay, whatever that should from skarm means, probably something not great
    that's a neat site
Maybe if you guys started giving skarm the benefit of the doubt you could start to wean him off of his violent tendencies
    it will lower the army's morale
*throws Skarm at shaco*
    *pokes gummy back*
yeah, you're supposed to poke or blow up squid, skarm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
    because sometimes you just want to kill without worrying about who doesnt respawn
I also think Skarm doesn’t want to kill me for real because he gets too much enjoyment out of this
    but still, i only really enjoyed one class
*throws Skarm at Flubs*
    **gives ida & squid some deodorant**
Can’t you be helpful Skarm?
    at least it kept recording
skarm is being helpful to flubs to an extent
    i'm aware of this
now I'm wondering if that message has been recorded by skarm
    Gummy's loafing around, to nobody's surprise.
*throws bloody shirt at Skarm*
    _pokes ida with caffiene_
No, that was the stuff Skarm gave to me. I’m just waiting to see it explode
    that was a bad shot and I should feel bad
and now skarm is attempting to snipe you for throwing his deodorant
    i gotta go hit a pillow rn
can i have a large 42oz steak skarm?
    iconoclasts.
Or in this case, skarm is calling his guerilla group of warriors to fight against your right to have steak. He's probably an adamant vegan
    tics people off is all i can agree with in that name
just like skarm when he tried to steal my cinnamon roll
    slow clap
*makes Skarm come up with 10 examples*
    _injects caffeine into squid's nose_
_blames skarm for this_
    _just realized he had a program running in bluej the whole time_
*bonks skarm on the head for betrayal of his creator*
    _hasn't had a watch since middle school_
*throws Skarm at Rainy to get my money back*
    _yells at squid_
*throws squids at Skarm*
    *makes a time machine*
*opens Skarm and finds a self destruct mechanism*  I think you're right, Squid.
    its a good thing i dont get messages from blocked people <:kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws my blocked messages at Skarm*
    *throws a fish at the shorts*
*puts 1,000,000 of Skarm’s money on KappaPride for me*
    *throws a fish at the point*
Thanks for the $1 million Skarm
    germany like always kills all the city-states
*puts skarm in his place instead*
    _slaps squid _
Go to work Skarm
    yeah i'm gonna pay you... bitch
I feel like that skarm is going to pay you in monopoly dollars
    eew social
I don't want to hear it from you skarm, back to work
    i take it youre trying to draw a circle
If that doesn’t work, throw Skarm at it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
    ok i got panda set up
Hey skarm I need your help with something
    i wouldn't know
thanks for nothing skarm
    you pinged us
*gets restraining order on skarm*
    _goes to ida's gym and messes up the battle field_
of course skarm commits vandalism
    i don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation
Harassing Skarm has become tradition here <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
    octothorpe.
For a minute, I thought skarm was just throwing another insult at squid
    if you're going to show me bull videos gummy, then no
That’s just one of my many corpses from the times Skarm ~~and RC~~ have killed me
    get the traitor
*taxes Skarm every time he kills me*
    *slaps the game with a fish*
now im glad i didnt have skarm sien all of these notifcations back out
    i mean if i were to remove that i would only retain my magic wand
Why does Skarm have a magic wand?
    i feel like i should know who chaos3000 is but i don't
dear squid, skarm is about 25% done big brothering you
    theyre worth nothing on their own but so much when put into a fucking barrel
master is making skarm do deep learning on your messages so we can have an ai that behaves exactly like you without needing the real thing
    previous mistakes were repeated
skarm has to ping discord servers about 5000 times
    i assume tom is the one playing monster rancher?
*makes Skarm do something loud*
    _screeches_
Why does Skarm get mad at me?
    i hate
I feel like that reason for skarm getting mad at you would be pretty obvious
    i don't remember the last time i played league
No, skarm's just being random
    lets do the math here, right?
Do something interesting Skarm. I’m bored
    i saw that they received a massive rework on the wiki.
*punishes Skarm for being uninteresting*
    *frames gummy for the crime*
Tfw Skarm framed Gummy for something that Squid did to him
    gamestop drago
I mean big skarm is watching
    ok, i think that's getting me. what do you mean exactly? sorry if this is frustrating you, btw.
guess which one of those lines skarm decided to learn
    stop attatching fireballs to me, dammit! trying to build here
sooner or later skarm will spit that right back out at you
    he also thought that pi should have been twice what it is today
Why would Skarm spit at me? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
    cause have you ever heard of missile thrusters?
*throws a banana at skarm*
    _bans drago_
*catches footballs and hands them to skarm* take these will ya?
    nah my bad
*throws a bowiling ball at skarm*
    _watches gummy level up again_
skarm can attest to that
    awful disney movie
@everyone stream started and skarm is slacking off
    Or we could just shoot at it!
You aren't live until skarm says you are <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
    no squid
*throws Skarm at Gummy for yelling*
    _dodgerolls_
_pokes skarm with a king_
    *switches places with flubs*
now the question is do i feel like doing source control for skarm today like i said i would last night
    is the sea always salty because the land never waves back?
and now skarm decides to start asking philosophical questions
    (yes it worked)
*throws Skarm at Dragonite*
    _suddenly is very hungry_
_pokes skarm with a many word thing_
    _throws gum balls at drago_
something tells me that's not going to change from skarm anytime soon
    thats not even an answer choice, squid, lol
Neither will I because I keep sayin Skarm at the beginning of a sentence
    i'm not going to call you that just to prove you wrong
skarm having his name lower cased at the start of messages probably will trigger him to pop up
    tl;dr depressions a bitch
yeah, I was right, I guess skarm being capitalized at the start just doesn't work
    right master
skarm has cooldowns that you guys probably overlooked
    but yeah high school graduation, than a graduation party with a lot of drinking..🙄
*throws Skarm at Dragonite*
    _reels dragonite back in with more spaghetti code_
*makes Skarm do Dragonite’s homework*
    _pokes the ninny in the throat_
_chucks rc out the skarm_
    *you have me squid*
im tempted to add a thing where skarm picks up usernames as key words and restricts his replies to that but on the other hand thats way too much effort for how much other stuff i should be doing rn
    maybe if you disable bluetooth on your laptop, it with automatically reconnect.
how bad an idea do you think it would be to rewrite skarm completely from scratch when the aws thing runs out?
    that was orgasmic to watch. and i was there
ok so the obvious choice then is to rebuild skarm in html
    you're why i'm racist in this game
bella want to help with skarm 2.0?
    i was planning to do math homework today, i was just too tired xp
skarm, what should i do
    i'm probably going to need new earbuds come to think of it, they're condition is just not going so well
Those were explosive cookies Skarm gave to me
    he an kick people?
*throws Skarm at Gummy*
    _throws cheese at majestic_
did skarm actually record that line
    bella dont worry stardew wont be as good as you think it is right now after a bit
*throws an essay at Skarm*
    _goes and sits in the corner_
_pokes skarm with a spoon to see what happens_
    _noms <:redditsilver:383343161356976128>_
*pokes skarm with a fork because he nommed reddit silver*
    *pokes gummy back*
skarm say some stupid shit
    got my itunes working
That’s not stupid enough Skarm
    speaking of which i should probably go back to being a normal guru
*makes Skarm help dig the hole*
    _hair flip ends up slapping flubs _
_pokes skarm with a frying pan_
    _calculates that to be 4 pings per 53 seconds and remains confused _
I volunteer Skarm to be a gladiator
    look at my ranks
Hey Flubs, you want to fight Skarm?
    i’m now at an outlet mall that’s 90% clothes stores, 5% food and other stores, and 5% closed stores
skarm  go some where better
    i never answer 900 numbers
*throws Skarm to somewhere better to fight*
    _casts magic on gummy_
is it just me or has skarm not been counternomming as much recently
    funny how a jerk friend tried to convince i really was a lady and that my brain was telling me i wasn’t
Why was someone trying to convince Skarm that he was a lady?
    brb gonna scare the shit out of sarah
okay, I was thinking the skarm nomming this user message would pop up until that happened
    although i broke that trend.
Hmm, I don’t think Skarm likes nomming people anymore
    unless it's custard or froyo
*gives Gummy Skarm to bite*
    _sets fire to scratch_
*swaps places with skarm*
    _falls back onto bed_
I'll punch you right outside the window, squid. Or I could let skarm do it because he probably has that message in his log
    or just ignore reports unless the person gets them constantly or all 4 do it to hi assuming theyre not a premade
Always punch skarm, he's a good punching bag, *punches skarm* see?
    eyan, you're not sirchez. shaddap
the system may have gotten confused from the apostrophe after the last letter in skarm as well as there being no space between that and the mark.
    skyrim belongs to the fucking nords
*YELLS AT SKARM TO GET A LIFE*
    *constricts brads movement with an accordion*
And as such, Skarm has decided to wrap you in an accordion
    You remind me of the Penguins. You are broken and battered and you somehow walk away with two wins instead of one.
*makes Skarm go to Flubs*
    _looks at his pfp_
I'M HERE TO EAT DONUTS AND KICK SKARM INTO BUILDINGS!!! AND I'M ALL OUT OF TATER TOTS
    something about blue light
*launches Skarm into space to do that to him*
    *sends dragonite a paper with the word help on it*
I think skarm wants you to help him against squid
    belethor just casually accepts it lol
almost just got myself censored by skarm lol
    was this in  bronze 16?
*throws skarm into the -23(76)squared chair
    godammit deci, god, terrible, horrible, what are you doing man?
*throws Skarm at Dragonite*
    *throws squid off a cliff*
*throws Skarm at Dragonite*
    _force chokes squid again_
skarm has a new anti-idiot feature
    *<:kreygasm:327309186515992577>ic sounds* so fabulous
*throws the country at Skarm* okay let's start over with a fresh slate
    thats that to none
hey skarm, want to ponder the meaning of life?
    Screw walls! They were overrated anyways.
idk i like skarm's meaning
    what dance video?
*pulls out a box top sword* YOU WANNA GO??? *slices skarms head off* YAAARRRR
    go to sleep now, then..... or go to school, maybe?
I always wanted to play along with eyan's heart gold lp but he had a skarmory so early in the game that it was hard to do
    why is he reading the back of a happy meal?
Did he like gen that skarmory
    as of course you can imagine, they used everything on me
_feeds gummy to skarm_
    _flushes master down the toilet_
*uses flamethrower on skarm*
    _chew on squid_
and then you programed skarm to make sure they werent worried about ai takeovers
    youre a liar
If Eyan doesn't like Pokémon anymore than why is there a skarmory bot
    <:LUL:305559915714576385> 
and he still likes Skarmory
    *<:kreygasm:327309186515992577>ic sounds* so fabulous
and none of the emotes skarm just used are here, i tapped those in thru a different server
    blankets are great because theyre like socks but easy to put on
*throws skarm at flubs*
    _pokes pokes_
Hey skarm may i have some fruit roll ups  please?
    and you havent lived until youve been hiking up a mountain for an hour or two  and then trip and break your leg
suck a duck skarm
    unless it's custard or froyo
skarm what do you think about this
    annoyingness
well you're no fun at all, skarm

_feeds rc to skarm_

    *breaks winter*
*throws Skarm at RC and runs to bed*
    *throws genwunners out the window*
I don't want this
*throws skarm at squid*
    There are 10 types of people in the world - those who understand tertiary, those who don't, and those who thought this was a binary joke.
No, I'm giving Flubs ideas, and to a lesser extent, skarm
    ahem
Stay out of this birdbrain
    nooooo ida
*throws Skarm out the window for calling me Ida*
    _watches fish secure the point_
Say something interesting Skarm
    just use a bigger bomb and then they don't have families
well that is certainly interesting, skarm...
    cosmic chicken
is this true Skarm
    i made a rounding error, which is weird because how i've been rounding is the same way i'[ve been rounding the entire year and it's never done me bad until now
guys skarm has rgb lightsabers now
    rarity pkushie made in the uk
*breaks Skarm again for no reason*
    _blows up_
*throws Skarm at the flailing*
    _banishes gummy to the land of whatever the other discord hes in is called_
Dragonite, Skarm is supposed to be the pun teller <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

*throws Skarm off the ship*
    _pokes flubs with subscription emails and the sort by date heading_
I think Skarm took it. He really wants the robots to take over
    empty weekends
*throws Skarm back to lastvillage*
    _now wants to change gummys name to anything but rarity_
*slaps skarm* darn it
    also happy valentines day and happy singles awareness day! :seoxyslove:
think you broke skarm more
    i thought it would fall to deci since youre not married yet
skarm being more broken? In what world?
    After periodic doubts about his vocational calling, the young chemistry teacher concluded he was out of his element.
He’s telling puns again. Skarm is fine
    that isn't me
*throws Skarm out the window*
    *slaps the game with a fish*
yeah that wasn't skarm at all, ,that was his shadow
    that changes nothing
*makes Skarm less boring*
    *blows up squid's house*
I'm glad you actually thought ahead for skarm to blow up houses
    old timey pistol also seems balanced tho, bc you take a lot of time to load it and it isnt accurate, but still a gun
*switches places with Skarm*
    *y’all need jesus*
by that logic you were impaled and then swapped with skarm
    i only found one shield in the dungeon by the way.
i mean i could look through skarm's log and extrapolate from there but that sounds like a lot of work
    https://clips.twitch.tv/SourBlatantCrowKippa
_points at skarm and watches skarm go zipping into his finger_
    _pokes ida with a stick_
Why did Ida have to get poked Skarm?
    man i love empire total war
skarm stop hanging out with gummy
    just use a bigger bomb and then they don't have families
That is a solution, how good of one on the other hand, ask skarm
    greetings, bella.
And also Skarm has no vpice
    master have you looked at libgdx yet
*waits for Skarm to step in*
    *opens underground dnd ring in the gym after hours*
Ok, it looks like Skarm doesn’t feel like killing me today
    is it a tool that penetrates and measures penetration?
*switches places with Skarm before that happens*
    _collets some samples_
*throws a fish at Skarm because I’m bored*
    *noms door*
One day i will have a Birdbrain for dinner

_does a diff on skarm's code_
    *sigh*
*throws Skarm at the Mets*
    _whacks squid on the head with it_
skarm are you a robot
    maybe the game hates me
DONT YOU CARE ABOUT SKARM’S FEELINGS?! BECAUSE I CANT
    what is even going on
26550 from draco
8238 from skarm
    i feel like this is gonna activate something but its ok, its just gummy
So Skarm is a communist I guess
    i already played a bit of that
why is skarm red galoer now
    I feel like Ralts would be a real cool Pokémon to have because you could just squish it.
*throws Skarm out the window*
    *strikes ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) through something*
*throws Skarm at Gummy to torment him*
    _changes squid's channel back to math_
whoever said skarm was only allowed to torment gummy?
    are you texting and driving, first of all
while im in skarm, anyone want me to add anything to him?
    i resent that statement. off with your head
I guess skarm didn't appreciate such action
    be peaceful
Hey Skarm, make our jobs not suck
    code instead
what, making skarm do it instead?
    i was hoping for a better troll response
skarm doesn't learn mentions
    take him to symphonic evolutions
*throws Skarm and runs*
    _yells at squid_
*throws Skarm out the window because he didn’t call me Squid*
    _rolls away from this mine field of a conversation_
None. Skarm is paying the taxes
    anyways where was i?
Yeah, Skarm's busy doing his taxes right now. Don't disturb him, he just lost his place.
    greetings, squid.
_throws skarm at squid_
    _wallops squid with storm breaker_
Oh skarm can't manage messages in blackomen LUL
    there goes my wallet
<@137336478291329024> want skarm to have mike or some variation added to your trigger list :Keepo
    why they did it like that i have no idea
shut up, stupid birdbrain bot
    why would we stop this beautiful thing
looking into that now because skarm's announcement code is the spaghettiest of the spaghetti
    flubs is hiding nothing
ehh, i'm procrastinating other things today, i might as well see if i can fix skarm
    i feel like i should know who chaos3000 is but i don't
huh, last time skarm even checked to see if zeal was live was may 5
    honestly it mightve been in utah. ive been to utahs capital and one other town north of that i cant remember the name of
am shocked that I just found out Skarm/Zeal has a Discord.
    there's mods for everything, the question is, are there _good_ mods for everything
oi skarm, ,murder this squid
    is a pint of ice cream a lot?
because skarm fucking hates your guts, obviously
    they apparently don’t want kids to worried about finals and grad so they do grad first
but do your other servers have Skarm
    or given my personal rating
I needed this server to fill that whole in my heart that missed Skarm.
    flub flub
Garbage Day? *throws Skarm out*
    bop ***explosion***
I didn’t know Skarm was a bomb
    does adobe have a disable feature function?
what do you think about this, skarmm
    ohhhhhhhhhhh
Did the realization kick in for skarm?
    isnt that just calculus
so should mee6 fear for their life at this point? skarm is taking all their jobs
    i would go
but yeah since mee6 is in charge of twitch announcements, skarm gets join announcements
    im just excited to read napoleon in america
so no other servers would have skarm? come on, drago
    what you do now
~~And is that either Skarm or Flubs?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
    i think its like wolv-ee

You just punched Skarm in my place
    my bot learns from the best
from being punched by people he tends to mock, that's the bot skarm alright
    teh bass on the right?
Go help Master, Skarm
    this is shaping up to be a good story, i don’t feel powerful
I never introduced myself, just said, "I used to watch Skarm/Zeal/Eyan and was yearning for his stuff for YEARS. Now I'm here."

And then that's it.
    unfortunately yes
skarm, shut your damn mouth
    good
all my skarm code boils down to "if this, then that"
    i hate this game
I add RGB to my skarm code
    getting the account isnt even the hard part
i should stick a cooldown on that feature of skarm's
    b/c vc
skarm where are you
    i'm about to kick your ass out
I don't skarm approved of being nommed
    but there better be food there
skarm is hungry too
    i'm a terrible person
Now go set up skarm.js
    that is how to team
do you mean the skarmberry pi?
    i love comcast!
oh crap i just realized that if i want to get the skarmberry pi up and running i need to get my micro SD back from Mom
    yeah, but i was trying to avoid outright saying it in case anyone got any smart ideas
okay time to get skarm on github, like a year late
    some previous test subjects have been able to. others not so much
so some have succeeded to getting skarm on github, while others have failed
    holy fuck everything in switzerland is expensive
skarm how you feeling
    java
I'm sorry, is skarm the tuba?
    or pack idk what you call them
_plays a scale using skarm's circuit board_
    *should*
_sends skarm to the old folks' home_

Did Skarm do something terrible?
    i am *astonished*
*throws Skarm at Gummy*
    _pokes flubs_
*makes Skarm do something loud*
    *blows up squids organelles*
i should program skarm to sing it when i get home
    in that case the response wouldve been very carefully
We don’t need Skarm singing. He’s probably bad at it
    so that we can bitch about the french
skarm i think it's high time you start making sense
    sudo make me a sandwich
skarm will start making sense when you program him to make sense
    that too lol
should i program skarm to sing when i get home?
    who doesnt beat the patriots at this point? be real here
I see Skarm is pretty patriotic
    <:kappapride:379352530863521792> ?
skarm sing something please
    too much xcom
skarm sing something please
    no its 8:01
skarm sing something please
    Did you know that you can cool yourself to -273.15�C and still be 0k?
skarm sing something please
    i need more manee. why am i so broke?

"work[ing]" is never a term that ought to be used to describe skarm
    "but eyan, the whole world will hate you!" so?
skarm put the oreo award back
    i hate algebra <:rooderp:399827526744014848>

It’s too quiet. Do something loud Skarm
    or you could get a job <:kappa:374346980136058893>
of course, dragonite programmed skarm well enough for it to be a snark machine
    skarm knows all
Always blame Skarm. ALWAYS

You okay there skarm
    ｡･ﾟ･◝( ◕ ヮ ◕)◜･ﾟ･｡
The King of Zeal is Super Skarmory right?
    now he's taunting you
That's Super Skarmorys name?
    the bunny is drago and the crocodile is a brony friend
The bot says something when you say Skarm or Skarmory
    but it uses matrices to find the cross product
*throws Skarm at Gummy for committing treason*
    *blows up squid for being meta*
im siding with skarm
    iiz slen nus
Why can’t Skarm blow someone else up?
    can you imagine someone being a wizard with a spatula?
because a.) skarm records lines. And b.) italicized messages that have your name in it are more likely to pop up due to design and code
    Also, dragonite and the robot are on top of each other.
getting to the point where he's as rude as skarm later on the road
    so it's badluck day number 4
what is that even a reference to, skarm
    i said harder, not less hard
skarm let's not get weird
    I'm having a mid-life crisis today. It has resultsed in me randomly playing basketball.
you're telling skarm to not get weird, that's obviously not going to work
    yeah so
*shoves skarm down squid's throat*
    *throws hot chocolate at nothing*
isn't skarm also a bomb? You can use him
    but rum
is that an invitation for skarm to start singing shanties?
    I would tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it.
I don’t think Rainy wants you or Skarm hugging her
    how come i still do?
*makes Skarm make sense*
    _dunks on gummy with the burrito_
btw i kind of want to do something to skarm's "playing" line. should i make it something like
```e!help | silly message here```
?
    i know right?
_pokes skarm with a stick_
    _gives squid something to do_
give it a couple weeks and skarm will be a complete ass to you
    i'm a purple i think
skarm what do you have to say about the way the mets season is going this year?
    send me in
isnt that right skarm?
    wanna make games with me and master?
excuse you, skarm is the biggest weirdo here. That is an undeniable fact, ,no matter how hard you try
    gummy, i will beat any toxic narcissism out of you so help me god
skarm is only the average of all of us
    no squid that’s inappropriate
skarm save me pls
    what moron thought of that idea?
or ask skarm would put it "what moron thought of that idea"
    corphish had 85% control
~~What does Skarm have to do with this?~~
    i mean let's be real, xc1's menus are awesome considering the stupid amount of things that they do
_whacks guy with skarm_
    _whacks squid on the head with it_
Why did Skarm hurt me when I wasn’t around?
    woot time to go charge my switch then
Honestly, I’m starting to get tired of Skarm going after me a majority of the time
    you know i did tell you to come like forever ago
skarm should now go after me more often instead of squid now:
```js
                // This is bad and I should feel bad (makes drago's name pop up more often in conversation)
                for (var i=0; i<5; i++){
                    line=lines[Math.floor(Math.random()*lines.length)];
                    if (line.toLowerCase().includes("drago")){
                        break;
                    }
                }```
    only ida likes me here 😭
im pretty sure ida doesn't like skarm at all
    funny you mention that, that was what i had in mind
Would it be a good idea to *blacklist* names from appearing in skarm's quotes?
    Did you hear about the guy who got hit in the head with a can of soda? He's lucky it was a soft drink.
i feel like that would  take away from skarm's immersiveness as an almost person
    while also dressed in a modded chicken suit
*disowns Skarm because why not*
    _turns on remote control and turns them on dragonite_
well... at least skarm is working as intended...
    gomme sounds like a devil fruit
So you could be skarm
    habanero sauce
also master, i have no idea what you're talking about skarm's reference thing not working, it worked for me while i was out.

why would you trust skarm with a tuba?
    niall? i agree, best emperor
oh hey i just noticed you made skarm do the intro instead of mee
    they cause me to be stressed the fuck out
So, you just bonked me with Skarm?
    how about napoleon total war?
Don’t turn into Gummy, birdbrain

Good job Skarm (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
    it has been requested that we route this conversation over to <#311411150611021824>
yes, let's put an unrelated conversation to <#311411150611021824> , it's perfect, skarm
    the only reason i got something out of that was because i'm a god, but...
Good, you got it right this time, Skarm
    gummy can i write your biography
*burns the monopoly money and charges drago the skarm tax*
    _checks jello for a pulse_
_feeds gummy to skarm_
    _throws in lillie bot_
speaking of i genuinely want to see gummy make a bot because i'm sure skarm would go to war with it immediately
    you use these words
I mean, if you want bots to fight, then there are probably skarm quotes revolving around killing mee6
    e3 was fuckin boring
skarm what do you have to say about this
    i'm gonna do what any reasonable person would do and blow them up
skarm: 1; rc: 0
    you'll probably live
*throws Skarm out the Kenobi*
    _ships drago and master_
Hey, I didn’t tell Skarm to do that.
    can you imagine someone being a wizard with a spatula?
If it tries to do so, throw something at it. Skarm usually works
    that stage is one of the few things i remember about my childhood
_charges skarm's therapy sessions to squid's credit card_
    *bounces out on a timpani*
kind of hoping for irish skarm to stop soon
    hey russia or great britain?
skarm's code has more bugs
    i didnt like that one
hey master i got skarm to pin the "automated message" message and then not send it again so the next time you get the double message \*should\* be the last
    if you were told simply to disprove a formula's ability to only generate primes then why do you need to make a new formula with the same objective?
hey master should i post an announcement saying masa mune people can set their skarm ref strings now, or do you want to give it some more testing first?
    if i make myself to apparent i will get mugged
Good job Skarm (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
    even more odd when someone else posted and said it will be on adult swim
_throws a piano at drago and skarm_

Good job Skarm, use the grenade on him for throwing a perfectly good piano
    i like all boobs! all boobs are good boobs
No, skarm's talking about his favorite show, Drake & Josh. Not everything the bot says will be lewd

sometimes if you type cookies skarm will steal them
    oh careless whisper is playing let me get through that first
you gotta work skarm into a sentence
    something something wookies
Skarm don't take anyone's cookies
    it sucks you in, i know that from experience
It's on his Super Skarmory channel

skarm say something sane

skarm is supposed to be doing the murdering, not you, drago

Get me some earplugs, Skarm
    i kind of want to try that but at the same time i don't because what if it doesn't work
master did you get rid of the code that makes skarm not say squid's name?
    i didn’t get “drunk” but i definitely woke feeling super tired
should skarm have some reaction to that?
    nah, kara and sara are both my two least favorites
why does it say never trust a benny on skarm?
    and then went rogue.
solution: don't put passwords in skarm
    no the other one
oh you mean in not skarm
    it's not that, it's just that my internet is going to make things a pain because of constant buffering
also wondering how long itll be before skarm randomly quotes draco welcoming someone to the kingdom
    wait
skarm i said how you feeling today
    *negates squids noise* no, it has to ve a pleasant sound
Skarm i swear to god
    godammit deci, god, terrible, horrible, what are you doing man?
Well, you’re Deci now. Skarm said so, which means it must happen
    I would tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it.
skarm up, sort of
    dragonite are you in the steam beta?
i mean it's either that or skarm has been messing with his own code
    and only 1 line of ghost and dragon types; i never liked that
*sends Skarm after RC*
    *dammit, they're already on to me*
As always, Skarm is of no help
    I was gonna heal you!
okay, skarm's probably plotting conspiracy

no school talk skarm

I thought Skarm was 4 1/2
    i will live you *motherfuckers*
skarm what do you have to say about this
    I feel like Ralts would be a real cool Pokémon to have because you could just squish it.

    you know what? super fuck it
Now thats why I love Skarm
    i'm gonna make my character like a cool version of me
Thats the spirit skarm
    i'm rooting against koreans
Yes skarm gets it
    You can be full of bullshit but as long as you sound like you know what youre talking about, people will gravitate toward you.
    why the hell would... what?? whatt??? wat.
Exactly skarm, drago can I buy him off you?
I feel like selling skarm to gummy would be considering the bird is a bot
    even i do that sometimes tbh lol
im not sure how to feel about that skarm
    maybe it is
skarm are you an adult?
    tl;dr depressions a bitch
~~It looks like Skarm likes the word “back”~~
    no
i only know that if skarm yells at you then it's on the ban list
    honestly thats kinda smart
skarm stop being stupid
    i dont do terms
no idea maybe i should implement a feature in skarm to store suggestions
    we own the land, we own the planet
i curated some of the better instances of skarm: https://twitter.com/i/moments/1033923587613319169
    all music is bad, so yes.
*plays music loudly into Skarm’s ears*
    _throws his entire kitchen at bella_
I think I know why skarm stopped recording general lines <@!137336478291329024>
    thats me, baby
i suddenly want to implement a feature into skarm that calculates the most-often-said word combination in this server
    Can I get a toxic sewer ooze?
Drago how's fixing skarm going?
    ive slept 433.5 hours so far since june 6, played warframe for 180.5, and did spreadsheets for 31.5
More difficult is to explain skarm because you made it
    boobs make the world go round, man
Are you saying skarm could've hacked his way out of his aws vm?
    i need to get in my pc again
So Skarm has his own computer that he can get into? Uhh...
    calc is great because it combines that numbers sense of math with physics applcation
<@!212257792722075650> get me the entire lyrics of ra ra rasputin and I'll teach it to skarm
    alright im kicking your butt out
What, teaching Skarm song lyrics or him kicking Master out?
    except i made the wrong event the first time
t!remind this is fine burning room with skarm instead of dog in 2 hours
    dragonite, smack him with a frying pan if you please. =w=
Skarm feature request: an auto-needsmorejpeg command
    its going to take forever to train Gummy
skarm attack mee for us will you
    im just excited to read napoleon in america
    operation spider stank
Look at skarm's github for reference
how many lines of the file skarm spits out at a time
    no, i'm here to conquer your ass
Brad while you're on there check how many boob quotes skarm has
    i like how the dead sea provides fresh water
*gives atoms to Skarm because I don’t need them*
    _waves his hands_
But master if you want to chuck "hands" on Skarm's to-do queue I'll get to it once I'm done wasting time
    what moron thought of that idea?
This concludes today's round of pissing off as many physics majors as possible, I'm going to go work on Skarm now
    more disappointed than previously i'd like to assume
oh dang Skarm had a comeback for that one
    the only thing that pops into my head is why
Skarm's github page broke
    like this entire guy is just useless
we know you are, Skarm
    <:kappa:374346980136058893>
I still think Skarm is an absolutely hilarious bot
    won't get off my dick. i mean it's great and all but could you get off?
Why is skarm restsrting a lot?
    good, it's working
It turns out the command was `git pull origin master` not `git pull SkarmBot master`
    let me make shit up
Welcome to how I felt week one working on skarm
    i had no clue what i was doing
Also do I have permission to add a one-in-fifty chance of Skarm spitting out a random xkcd when spoken to
    youre good. move along.
as in "exploit" as in "I found an exploit in Skarm that allows arbitrary users to ban other arbitrary users" or as in "explode" as in "flubs"
    i have no clue what i just said
Why did Skarm react to that?
    it’s legit
Being annoying is like the primary motivation for me to continue developing Skarm
    why?
Unrelated but I looked at the main function in bot.js like six times and I still can't figure out why skarm isn't learning new lines
    don't forget her cousin
guess i'll work on skarm tomorrow either before or after my eight and a half hours of classes
    also kicking the creator of the bot on that server isn’t a good idea as well
~~Like making sure Skarm doesn’t blow everyone up~~
    seems i must have my 50 million tabs of terraria wiki open again
if skarm blows everyone up that means i just have a few fewer things to worry about
    elven pem?
So you need to get that before Skarm can become a demolition expert
    86 years old
Skarm would probably say otherwise
    besides that dude from pokemon
Speaking of skarm apparently all of the cool kids use `let` to declare variables in javascript nowadays. Should I go through his code to fix this when I get home or just leave it as is to piss people off? <@162952008712716288>
    not like the npc is going to be useful to us now
hey skarm how many donuts do you have in your stomach right now?
    i technically have to be somewhere at 10:30 tomorrow but i got like nineteen hours of sleep today so i should be good right
No that's 11:30 which is just a few blocks away. Skarm youre drunk again
    Or we could just shoot at it!
How about we don't do that, skarm
    but i want to play with libgdx
At least use eye protection before randomly shooting things skarm
    i know
do you though? do you really skarm?
    and thus, the great kit kat bar kept me awake forever
yea you may wanna get some sleep skarm
    primitive types dont have methods
*shoots skarm with a marshmallow canon* DIE
    just my mom....
Why do you want your mom to get hit with marshmallows, Skarm?
    you now have to kill her and gain her power?
skarm doesn't have a mom
    or barry as a character, idk which. either way hes a dick
skarm came to be through spontaneous biogenesis
    that’s blitz’s thing
And yes by "more important things" I was referring to "making Skarm not broken"
    dammit gummy
But if I wanted to run around doing nothing I'd continue working on Skarm
    i can feel them
I was supposed to fix skarm two days ago
    hi persom
also master skarm is learning lines again apparently
    fire is ida’s thing
Skarm are you ready to perform the ritual?
    how much plat do you have?
no wonder skarm sucks
    you'll probably live
    i want the roleplay
ooh skarm learned the line "i like stupidity"
can we just go ~~euthanize~~ cure skarm of stupidity right now?
    It's all up to Gummy. We're screwed.
Why does Gummy has the deciding vote on curing Skarm of stupidity?
    hahaha, on your way to work, i've already finished my shift for the day.......kill me
I think skarm might be imitating someone very mockingly
    fire is ida’s thing
I'm getting rid of the "this is an automated message, if you want to turn it off do [thing]" thing that skarm sends you when someone says your name
    perfect
i cant wait for my classmates to find my account and find skarm and kick me oit of class
    he got depression for a while but he has since recovered from it and has been streaming for most of that time, hes busy with a job rn but it is in future plans to overhaul youtube
Oh yeah i figured out how to fix skarm announcing <@!137336478291329024>
    do you watch him at all?
You can have Skarm instead
    prepare the mega chicken
They moved it over to Mee6 once it broke for Skarm.
    xeon is basically space jesus or something
skarm used to ping twitch for activity like every five seconds, i think mee does it like every five hours
    though my brony friends still haven’t left even though i have anger problems
    ida!
ill turn it off once dragonite gets some implementation on skarm again
So I found a few commands in skarm that I don't know what they're for
    Did you hear about the guy who got hit in the head with a can of soda? He's lucky it was a soft drink.
Oh crap I forgot to update skarm's documentation
    ignoring your ass so i can actually set up an ambush
Have you gotten your daily dosage of stupidity today Skarm???
    hi pissy im flubs
alright skarms broken <@!137336478291329024>
    this is still going?
By throwing Skarm at him?
    My grade in Marine Biology is below C-level.
I can go, say, whack skarm with my keyboard right now
    but they are at war with me
i'd add a "pun counter" feature to skarm that tracks what percentage of a user's lines are worthy of capital punishment but there are exactly zero parallel universes where you losers _don't_ abuse that feature
    ah man i love hidden items finding to found it its a fucking x-speical
also master the `hello there` timer uses one of the hard-coded `setInterval` loops and i already use way more of them than is necessary. im closing this feature request ticket on the grounds that i'm lazy and skarm is badly designed and there's no reason for you loons to spam the trigger that often anyway.
    i slept like dirt today
*throws Skarm at the honking*
    _waits 40 of them _
skarm your in charge now
    i think you have it go multiple rotations and only pick points to connect every so often
<@!137336478291329024> or you could add that to skarm
    gummy cant you watch a normal youtube channel ever
to answer your questions i cant have skarm rename gummy, thats not in the discordie documentation anywhere (and that's probably a good thing), although i already wrote a random name generator that i could use for suggestions
    avicii was just found dead
dont murder the whiterun blacksmith please skarm
    idk if someone wants to teach despacitounge or surrenderspeech
You should have Skarm join, with how much he likes singing shanties
    or solitare
I'd rather not have skarm theoretically sing with me in the shower, thank you very much
    i still want to do a graybeard run some day
Sing with the Graybeards, birdbrain
    too much xcom
skarm needs 3 more messages to get to 6666
    it was nice while it lasted
skarm do something interesting
    that's a dragon priest
I'm sure skarm would want an answer
    <:gwtogareee:384871962519797760>
so skarm is now a law, is what youre saying
    I got cancer again
*throws Skarm at the delicate person*
    _throws batteries at master_
Well that was a bit weird, skarm
    have fun
im kicking myself off now, remember to go to bed when skarm tells you to
    same, how do you think i got lvl 90 lul
So, Skarm is level 90? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
    no one but me
The truth of skarms power
    i second this.
skarm would probably just go above whatever level cap there is
    i mean
What is it Skarm
    tried buying a laptop for $500 but card keeps getting decline
gummy you taught skarm bad grammar
    <:kappa:374346980136058893>
<@!162952008712716288> im going to noodle with link flair settings in the skarm bot thing so if you see a bunch of deleted posts soon that's most likely going to be because i dont know what im doing
    at my place of work, you will see people spend so much money on those and usually not make that amount back
Skarm did it not me
    I saw Bella say "but it's smaller than usual" and suddenly felt really bad for Dragonite for some reason.
_impales skarm and dragonite _
    _throws gum balls at drago_
when it gets recorded into skarm
    drago
Give it to Skarm
    we’re a small group
Skarm is actually coded in JS.
    did you see drago?
You already looked at skarm's github?
    super duper decade ago
Skarm randomly records lines in chat
    lol drago
All these lines that Skarm has been saying?  They were said in Discord at one point or another.
    i think boots and butts do deserve equal attention
But Skarm has his twitch
    i don't really have experience with skyrim or modding it so i don't have any number of modded skyrim in action.
skarm do you like emus?
    septimus singus has something to say about that
discordie, discord servers, or skarm?
    nooooo the dragooooooooon
discord servers: common term for an instance of a discord group with a full management system controlled by an owner but always online. 
discordie: spaghetti that has a 1E-90% chance of adding a program to your server to do random shit
skarm: im just typing for as long as possible at this poing so that she keeps poking you but skarm would poke you too in this scenario
    stabbing someone isn’t nice <:fluttershyscared:447198814747492352>
i wonder if `poke` is even in skarms current vocabulary
    i don't know what to do, its working!
Hey skarm wanna join gummyland/camelot 2.0?
    i am *astonished*
if skarm joins gummyland im going to program him to behave even worse than he does here
    i'm like 45% sure it is
im pretty sure dragonite didnt actually write a single line of skarm that had anything to do with servers
    probably doing better than you drago lol
So wanna join skarm?
    hey i nolife plenty
skarm what do you think of master's face
    i can answer that one for him
aw skarm learns more every day
    i meant the commies
How about we blame everything on Skarm?
    how small do you think this guy's dick is?
although gummy if you really want to be replaced i'm pretty sure i could just weight the values of phrases like "pony" and "war" in skarm's chat functionality
    many things and i hate typing on my phone so ill explain whenever im not on my phone
skarm you're not on your phone
source: am literally running you off my pc
    i found chocolate chunks in my keyboard
_pokes gummy with skarm_
    _grabs a magnet _
skarm try not to crash this time
    nope
Skarm is on my side
    dragonite
skarm say multiple words at once
    what does that even mean squid
im going to go pass out somewhere or something, skarms in charge
    i'd love to sample your hospi-
skarm you deal with spazzer
    ew starwars
*hits skarm with a frying pan* HOW DO YE FEEL
    yep just heard my dad freak out about it lmao
    no you don't
skarm can you confirm this
considering implementing a "times draco has done an unnecessary edit to clarify something that was already evident to anyone with more than a four-year-old's understanding of natural language processing" button to skarm but that feels like work
    delivery is key in making them actually funny
skarm youre an ai, waht do you think?
    glad i double checked that one
and skarm for company
    I couldn't figure out how to fasten my seat-belt. Then it clicked.
they stand for super skarmory
    gee wiz i like frost bite spiders! they're so cool!
skarm make sure they go to bed no later than 4:30
    mmmmmm the ground
Hey skarm is a grape considered a berry or not?
    i mean where did you find the news?
Why would the news talk about that, Skarm?
    i’m listening to this instead of stephen&friends broken picturephone. what am i doing with my life?
Show them skarm and ask for the next class
    probably better than nightshade
I still like my idea of showing skarm more
    it was literally the same stuff you had already learned
to skarm i leave my computer
    oh she’s been hitting on me the day she ask me out in grade 10
if there's any of it left by the time skarm is done with it sure
    i might only have 1 class on tues/thurs also since i'm thinking of dropping the public speaking class since i took another english class that i thought gave me credit for public speaking
and yet you didnt consult skarm before announcing it smh
    now what do i buy?
random skarm reboot is random
    i suppose the last question is if i want to cut the old brigade, answer, probably, but for some reason i can't bring myself to do it.  >_<
Go watch paint dry instead Skarm
    rc and i are twins
I will not forgive you. that goes DOUBLE for you skarm you bagel bite stealing magikarp
    i dunno, i got in a weird funk lately because of work and some other stuff
*slams skarm into an oil drum* HYAAAHHH
    This is so wrong on so many levels
we only reach a new level of insanity when skarm says we have
    so before i went to sleep today i figured out the formular to graph a brachistochrone and ive also added 2 new features to the bot
*kicks spazzer into skarm* SKARM ATTACK
    have you been mining for ore in the depths biome also
jey skarm is my homework correct?
    big brother feature
because inversion triads are pretty hard and i think that it's above Skarm's thinking capacity
    well don't throw up in here
*gives trumpet to Skarm*
    *sets animal man on explosion*
most of my pms are
a. nerding about harry potter with a friend
b. spamming programmerhumor links with a different friend
c. skarm telling me that someone mentioned my name
    have fun
skarm is basically zeal out of context anyway
    drago give me cooking advice
skarm i did no such thing
    or me
dont pin skarm, if he says something really good, throw it on r/skarmbot
    that was exciting
yes i've been complaining for months to not pin skarm because the pins are for things people say and not robots
    what the hell was that?
skarm doesnt have image delete log
    but you cant be animal and man
blowing up skarm would be too boring anyway
    i know right?
*dies so Skarm stops*
    _throws absolute values at wolverale_
A new skarm feature has been thoroughly tested and is now ready to break within five minutes of going public. If you are enlightened or at least a red gaoler, you can use e!setref yourName to have skarm PM you if you are mentioned in a conversation while afk. Thank you and stay zealous.
    brb looking for cheese
<@!137336478291329024> did you have skarm add a notice for that?
    i suppose the last question is if i want to cut the old brigade, answer, probably, but for some reason i can't bring myself to do it.  >_<
Also remember that on average I have to reboot skarm at least 5 times before my additions work as intended
    you can stop with your pickup lines now
    *noms revoking*
*throws Skarm into the mix*
Cna i have a cupcake yet skarm?
    yeah blame drago
in the meantime you can borrow skarm's or something
    explosion person?
How much effort would it take to have skarm spit out a list of users sorted by percentage for that?
    gotta love free destruction level ups
me sleep bye skarm your in charge again
    if my relationship works out i will need to learn the british pound sterling
skarm your not in charge tatsu is
    **unlaunchify**
Hey skarm I'll give you 2 choices, either give me a cupcake, or check my homework
    "parados"
Skarm did I teach you Latin?
    it's "only" flirting with 3 here
I DEMAND THAT SKARM GIVES ME A CUPCAKE
    and now they exist again
Cupcakes exist again and Skarm will never give Majestic one
    i have a response to that but i have to find the timestamp
skarm will take the drinks, leave your capslock at the door, welcome to the show
    what have you been drinking tonight?
I’m going to kill Skarm if that’s interesting
    but there are two people dedicating their entire lives to fish
maybe it should be longer until drago can be assed to fix skarm
    why?
Because you're broken skarm, are there any other questions?
    What do you call a tooth in a glass of water? A one molar solution.
i get to call you this and skarm owes me a cupcake
    i wonder if they actually expect anyone to watch it
*distracts Skarm with a Gummy*
    _picks gummy up off the ground and runs around with him over his head_
Wait is gummy a trigger word for skarm?
    not my fault apparently the pope hates me so i’ll just take napoleon to rome and loot it
So skarm and gummy can't be in the same message? much like we can't say Ida?
    razelan?
    holy hell, i'm mean, not literally satan
if gummy were a trigger word, we'd have way too much skarm
*dodges beaver and watches it hit Skarm*
    _rings drago's head_
skarm build me a time machine
    heh heh
i'm interested in seeing how exactly skarm plans on eating it
    $1.26 a liter
take skarm with you
    rarity pkushie made in the uk
wolfram alpha has now been integrated into skarm
    i took some steam screenshots, how can i find them?
and you can now literally ask skarm to do your homework
    who here wants more stream chat games and crap and modules and commands and stuff and things
we talk about cs almost _every_ night here, right skarm?
    none of these eyebrows speak to me
skarm done anything fun lately?
    I saw Bella say "but it's smaller than usual" and suddenly felt really bad for Dragonite for some reason.
i should probably make it so that skarm's game stays persistent every time he reboots
    but im not sure as of now im still looking it over
PRAISE THE SUN WITH ME SKARM
    this is the racist playthrough, guys
so i can add stuff to it and not have it end up like skarm
    nah its just drago 2.0
Did Skarm replace the real Dragonite?
    i'm about to kick your ass out
does skarmory joins the channels?
    <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
_looks hungrily at skarm_
    *throws rc out the window*
skarm this is your time to testify
    i was expecting skyrim but ok drago
skarm do you have any formal response to that
    *shrug* the instructions said not to
const win = 3 * Skarm.getLineCount() /(24+32 *System.currentTimeMillis());
    operation knife dragon
dont entice panda into flipping tables skarm
    what are you going to do
*throws Skarm into the abyss with Skarm*
    _bullies drago_
skarm be sure to water them once a week
    Or we could just shoot at it!
I now have cake, and no thanks to you skarm.
    sup im a dragon
SKARM DO YOU BELIEVE IN ME YET
    red is nicer tho tbh
I am very bored and have been playing edf for far to long. Entertain me skarm
    not if youre all thumbs
skarm beat up mee for me
    as many potatoes as is humanly possible
And I’m leaning towards hoping a friend doesn’t call me so I don’t get bothered while doing other stuff. Am I a terrible person? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
    hey kugal
<@!137336478291329024> What did you do to Skarm this time?
    just go on newegg and look at cheap ones
skarm how ya feeling
    i mean its true. you know what the old saying is. i forgot the old saying...
i bet if we made skarm watch cowboy movies he'd get at least 10% more interesting
    youve never had anything
i challenge you to a battle of who can break skarm the fastest
    are you sure?
i was about to fall asleep then skarm bothered me
    im going to take my leave from this conversation now
i need to be up by noon i should probably sleep be sure to listen to skarm bye
    filthy Rivens
skarm has warned us before
    man i love war
does skarm sound like someone you should listen to
    way less pollution
skarm convinced me not to all on its own just now
    lets do the math here, right?
I don’t think Skarm will do the math problems right
    garchomp and vaporeon as well
skarm actually has a math library-ish so maybe he will
    dragonite, smack him with a frying pan if you please. =w=
yay skarm is finally jumpin on the math train
    don't forget no wind
skarm what would you do if you were me
    upgrading to three blankets tonight
maybe i can make skarm do it
    wait what the fuck theres a bards college in skyrim
Tell me what Babel is, Skarm
    hmm, fair enough
skarm if it makes you feel any better the wolfy site doesn't understand that either```Wolfram|Alpha doesn't understand your query```
    inb4 i have like a 2k bounty
i could probably have skarm do that by having him load up Moby Dick and send a new line once a minute
    that's a good idea.
also new idea for skarm
    Also, dragonite and the robot are on top of each other.
yeah, that better not be the idea for skarm
    well its also a species but thats unrelated
besides maybe adding it to skarm
    “some people live a simple life, while others have a fire that threatens to engulf the world”
. . . i really hope skarm didnt learn that
    glad i double checked that one
skarm how ya feeling?
    what have you been drinking tonight?
going to be noodling with skarm for a bit so dont panic if he goes offline once in a while
    ooh hello
the skarmory forums are truly dead
    oh, never heard of it, lol
time to go back to working on skarm i guess
    oh the rules say nothing about people spying on my server sooo i can’t do anything about it unless he breaks rule 8
bella wanna update skarm for me?
    that obviously hasnt stopped spongebob
If you want me to break skarm, sure
    of course you sellouts would think the common folk are insane
skarm is your attorney
    and i’m not learning anything except how to be really lazy 😛
mainly because that would take skarm offline
    drago wanna trade sisters?
you have skarm running off your pc and not the pi again?
    it's because satire's not actually at all different from what it's mocking
crap skarm didnt learn that line
    go greeks
I demand my cupcake skarm
    plus daedric hand
skarm the department of health is here to see your kitchen
    angela convince- i mean nightshade convinced me to buy it
Go help him Skarm
    my brain hasn't booted up yet but i'm guessing i'm going to be in class when that goes off
*blows Skarm up because of that*

Oh? And who's him huh Skarm?
    getting laid's pretty nice... i know its very lewd
*makes Skarm tell us who he’s doing it with*
    *noms book*
The title of the book or the author of the book? There are many ways with Skarm these days
    he didnt explode :(
So he wanted whatever he was doing something with to explode. SKARM IS A MURDERER CONFIRMED
    computer
You’re a wizard Skarm
    then make one
or implement a reminder into skarm
    i honored you but thats only because i couldn't honor myself
You had 1 job Skarm and you screwed It up...
And no, I’m still alive
    i can only assume you should suck my dick
```[9:26 PM] Skarm-65Y: i can only assume you should suck my dick``` <@!162952008712716288> so the bot said this in a direct response to squid. had this been a real user, i would have banished them on the spot. i think we need to have a word about the lines you're training him on.
    discovered what ive discovered

You don’t get to have an opinion on this Skarm
    ram is good for me as well
hmm it's almost as if you _live in it_ skarm
    I saw Bella say "but it's smaller than usual" and suddenly felt really bad for Dragonite for some reason.

    i don't know either, but it was fucking hilarious
~~Yeah, you need to go further than PG with Skarm~~
    ddr3 pc3-12800 non-ecc (1600 mhz)

    oh no dragonite is gonna yell at me again
the odds of skarm reciting a line that was just said is somewhere between 1/4000 and 1/8000
    its not like i did anything worthwhile in high school anyway
skarm help make cad lewd
    I love when RNG rewards my stupidity
_puts skarm in the shower with rainy_
    _posts signs above gummy's head_
Keep that up and we’ll have to fire you, Skarm
    there's like ninety five conversations going on at once in here and i can't hear any of them
Also, Skarm didn’t do his job
    An hour or two, jeez, what do you envision me doing there
*does something to Skarm for Dragonite to fix*
    *throws wolverale to algetty*

    details
*smashes Skarm with the hammer that isn’t the banhammer*
    *sprays draco with water*

    that would be funny in real life though. "oh i cant walk because of those 4 swords longer than my arm strapped to my back. forgot about those.
skarm you dont have arms
    and the answer checker liked to do things like mark `x=5 m/s` wrong because it was looking for something like `x = 5 m/s`
and I guess skarm is doing physics now
    and then it kicked me out
skarm's hauling the wagon

I didn’t know Skarm could dock Dragonite’s pay <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
    ~~i knew ida was never really a human~~
Do something interesting Skarm
    England doesn't have a kidney bank, but it does have a Liverpool.
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, there once was a hero named Squiddy the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from old Rorikstead!

And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade and told of bold tale and the gold he had made!

But then he went quiet did Squiddy the Red, when he met the shield-maiden named Skarmbot who said:

Oh you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead, now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed!

And then came the clashing and slashing of steel as the brave lass Skarmbot charged in, full of Zeal!

And the braggart named Squiddy was boastful no more, as his ugly red baconator rolled around on the floor!
    rise!
oh and skarm youre now a lass
    tl;dr depressions a bitch
Great; you made Skarm depressed
    i need problems to invent stuff to solve for a class

    GIVE ME LUX

    it looked beautiful, but you failed miserably
implementing chess in skarm
    spooky
skarm you are now the zelian human rights commission
    til kugal is outside the universe
*throws Skarm at repetitive jokes*
    _noms flubs_
skarm has surpassed intelligence by such an extent that he's indistinguishable from idiocy
    because currently im going with drinking over eating because i care about my body on the outside only
i was going to suggest cloning skarm's source code and tearing it a new one but all right
    i'm not that stupid to do it in a rage
right so im shoving off but im going to leave skarm online in the hopes that windows doesnt crap out on me again
    it's like that but an anime
Dragonite anything worth skarm adding?
    just a general hatred for life, y'know, the usual
skarm say brb please
    the end
Finish the song Skarm
    back in albany he was teaching dance for 50-60 hours per week
gummy you need to break up with skarm

skarm you need to break up with gummy
    gummynite your breakup is scheduked for 12:35 pm pacific time
i wonder how hard it would be to program skarm to jump into voice and generate a continuous 512 hz tone
    bored right off the bat?
<@!137336478291329024> skarm addition, make sure all instances of zeal wheel have a ™ or else skarm sends ™ afterward on his own
    feel free to tutor me in math <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
how about i encode all references to zeal wheel in base-64 so that every time skarm spits one out people think he's broken
    why are you kicking gummy into the stratosphere
skarm deal with it
    __***skyui***__
would i get in trouble if i changed skarm's name to "guru of cupcakes"
    it just amazes me what people come up with
total characters written for skarm or real people or both
    What can i say, nobody likes you. Not even your cat.
maybe i should make a willofd mode where skarm distributes cookies instead of stealing them
    and actually add people i give a crap about
Skarm pinged me about it
    neato
me sleep now make sure skarm behaves
    whenever my (great?)grandparents were high schoolers
De-spaghettify Skarm's source code?
    you never talk to me
skarm you go do that
    i don't really even buy my own theory that i just came up with
skarm    help
    <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
i now have eight unread messages from skarm and i dont want to open them because there's a feature request in there and im going to forget it's there if i dont do it immediately
    I couldn't figure out how to fasten my seat-belt. Then it clicked.
skarm is just eating up these quotes today
    im the dovahclean
*throws Skarm at the enemies*
    *golf claps*
Don’t forget about Skarm
    i don't remember what it is but i know i played it before 14 days of shitstorm
Don’t tell Skarm that; he’ll try to take over
    sense of pride and accomplishment
skarm's in charge etc etc etc
    i'll proably get back into arena- holy shit i hate spiders
I think Skarm being in charge is a terrible idea
    ooh hello
Skarm get on it
    better credit
*sends Skarm after Gummy*
    *throws fish back into the ocean*
skarm you test it
    well i've got some years to go
skarm is like ashbot 1.5, who i made for gummy's camelot server at some point in probably late 2017?
    test
i should do that to skarm too hang on
    i also like just drunk ideas in general
cause ash was a joke and skarm is supposed to be less of a joke
    emperor of not, with the size of your rule i'd say thane at most
skarm's picture has now been corrected
    kelvin
why is Skarm upside down?
    i said dragon, not dragonite
skarm has the explosives
    so peacefull... i need a battleaxe dammit
Um, skarm is upside down..... why os skarm upside down? Someone explain.
    creative writing and essay shouldn’t be in the same sentence
On how to improve Skarm? Well options are fairly limited so i don't blame him
    **that is how to team**
I don’t believe that’s how it works Skarm
    speaking of which 18 in one week
skarm isn't upside down you're upside down
    what formular?
Skarm is the mother
    im retiring as of 5 hours ago
is that another skarm feature request
    but skarm youre like the most racist thing ever on this character!
the other thing im too lazy to do, and also i have thirteen notifications frmo skarm and i dont want to ruin it by clicking on them
    everyone's a little bit racist, no matter how much you try to deny it
or just write a command to make skarm ping me incessantly
    i resent that statement. off with your head
And I’m not sure how  Skarm feels about it
    he's been offline for a few hours, so its been pretty peaceful
it’s official, skarm knows too much
    how do you pronounce it?
I should add a Microsoft Sam capability to Skarm
    that is dr wossname
just submit a link to skarm's github you'll get an automatic 100% because it's long enough that everyone will assume that you know what youre doing even though absolutely none of it is legible
    last night was on the complex plane and demovire's theorems and today is about vectors and ellipses
_bribes skarm to make squid not alive_

So, Skarm will destroy everything
    you want to lay on my hand? would that make you happy?
should i throw some code into skarm to prevent people who aren't rank 1 from posting them or something
    and that, my friends, is how you team
i'm going to make skarm leave and rejoin at random intervals just to keep you wondering
    and it's time for us to leave her
skarm is your dating advisor
    youve broken my legs. how will i get to work now?
gummy you should ask skarm out
    its a rating of how often something appeas within a given set
what do you know skarm
    dude this just isnt even fair
tell her that drago would rather be asleep right now so she can talk to skarm until he wakes up in three days
    you tell them how fucking wrong that is
~~I thought it was Skarm~~

    i can't do it to drago but i forced gummy's
And send Skarm to hurt people at Bethesda
    no one cares about what I have to say...

skarm neither responded nor broke that's a good thing probably
    well, idk
