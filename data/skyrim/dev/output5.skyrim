That's far enough.
Hold and stand down.
Keep it. Not worth going to prison over.
That's the North Gate in case you forget.
That's a quick way to the executioner's block.
It's a long way to the next city if you change your mind.
No. You can use the North Gate, or you can head to the next city.
My orders are to tell the riff-raff to use the North Gate, that's it.
If you want to get into Riften, use the North Gate. This one's closed.
There's nothing else to discuss. Use the North Gate if you want to enter Riften.
You can use the North Gate to enter the city, or you can hit the road. Your choice.
If you want to enter Riften, use the North Gate. Otherwise, we have nothing to talk about.
That's the spirit.
The beasts return!
You belong to Hircine now!
Your blood is ours, Companion!
The Eye of Magnus?
Well, that's interesting....
Well, I suppose if that means what I think it does...
Then it's decided.
Agreed. To the death.
Farewell, Brother Casimir.
The Miasma? But, brother...
Then let it be done. Farewell, my brothers!
We have no alternative. It's the will of Vaermina.
But... no more than a handful of us remain, brother.
Then we have no choice. The Miasma must be released.
The orcs have breached the inner sanctum, Brother Veren.
Go now! The orcs could breach the inner sanctum at any moment!
We must hold. We can't allow the Skull to fall into their hands.
And what about you, Brother Casimir? Are you prepared to serve the will of Vaermina?
Brother Thorek, we must remain here and guard this Skull with our lives if necessary.
Brother Casimir, you must activate the barrier and release the Miasma. Let nothing stop you.
Tragic, of course.
He did? That's... I'm surprised.
I... I'll get his things in order.
Go. Grieve in whatever way you know.
This is... he should not have gone alone.
Truly, one of our great fires has gone out.
I wonder who will replace him in the Circle?
Skjor... I always thought of him as invincible.
He was the one I looked up to. I need to find my brother.
He has joined the honored dead. This will be a difficult time for us all.
Oh my. He was always so kind to me. A bit rough around the edges, but a good man.
I... I can only imagine Aela's anger. I'll make sure not to cross her for a while.
Unfortunate. He was an excellent sparring partner. I'll miss our training sessions.
Thank you for telling me. This is a day where our souls must cry, and our hearts will answer.
But, well. Fires go out. Others ignite. Skjor inspired many with his life. Perhaps his death can continue to inspire.
Treachery! Attack!
There he is! Get him!
What the... we've been betrayed! Look out!
Treasure, you say?
I suppose the Jarl won't mind if I'm gone for a little while. Lead on.
You know, in the Priesthood of Arkay, we have a joke about an empty pocket being better than a full grave.
Very much so, yes.
My only regret is that she doesn't host them more often.
Elewen's parties are always so elegant. She really has impeccable taste.
We'll get to that.
It's not so simple as just killing them, though.
Welcome to Riften.
You want in, you need to cooperate.
Well done, indeed.
You'll want to speak with Mirabelle Ervine right away. And welcome to the College of Winterhold.
Well, you clearly possess the minimum aptitude required. Congratulations. I'll escort you up to the gate.
Well, hurry it up!
Well, not exactly.
Listen, we're friends, right?
I wondered if I could ask a favor of you.
Well, yes! Please!
Hold a moment, Rune. What did you think about my idea?
Your idea to start a brothel, right? Do you want me to tell you exactly what I think?
I think if Brynjolf catches wind of it, he'll boot you right out of here... so drop it already!
What did you hear?
I didn't lose a lover, Viola, I lost my wife. It's not the same thing.
No, I really don't. It'll be a while before I'm ready for that. I'll be on my way now.
Well, if it works in the one case, why not the other? Don't you want to at least give it a try?
It was an old Nord proverb. It said, the best way to get over the loss of a lover is to find a new one.
Hello, captain! Can you spare a moment? I heard something the other day that I wanted to share with you.
What did you need?
You needed to know more?
Hmmm, you again. What is it this time?
No Firebrand Wine yet? How disappointing.
Look, I've told you everything. Now leave me alone!
You again? We have nothing else to discuss. Now move.
Ah, I see you have the wine. Hand it over and we'll talk.
Aringoth was a fool to think he could get away with this.
Our business has concluded and you're standing in my way.
No time for idle chatter. Mercer is awaiting your presence.
Why are you following me? I told you, I don't know anything else!
What did you want?
What did you want to know?
Back again? What is it this time?
You aren't worth my time. Piss off.
I'm through with you. Get out of my way.
Get in good with Brynjolf, then we'll talk.
You want to talk? Finish those jobs for Brynjolf first.
Stay out of the Black-Briars' business and you'll live longer.
Dirge told me you made it into the Guild. You need dirt on anything, you talk to me.
What do you think?
They're the worst kind. Even the Dark Brotherhood abides by a strict set of rules and tradition. These thieves are just rabble.
To call it a guild is ridiculous. How can people who would betray one another over a gold coin be considered part of an association?
What should we do?
We hold each other close and hope that all of this ends well.
I don't know what to believe. If it's true, then dark times may be upon us.
Talen, do you believe what they're saying? Do you really think the dragons have returned?
Why am I fighting?
I'm staying out of this.
This fight is pointless.
I see no reason to fight.
This fight makes no sense.
There's no reason to fight.
I really don't want to fight.
I see no reason to keep fighting.
Suddenly I don't feel like fighting.
I'm not interested in fighting anymore.
Yes sir, fine sir.
Everything well, Jesper?
Good, good. Keep up the hard work. It'll all pay off.
You saw her ghost?
Best tell the Jarl.
I'm glad it was you and not me.
The spirit world is strong in this place.
She's buried outside of town. That's where I'd look.
Look to the graveyard. That is where you'll find her.
The poor child is probably beggin' for us to string up her murderin' father.
You're telling me.
Ah, that's too bad.
Have you heard from your family recently?
No, not really. Couriers don't seem to like delivering letters here.
Not at all. It means I'm not being hounded about my progress at the College.
Are you a stranger?
Helgi. But father says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
I remember you. You're the stranger. Father says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
Best to keep clear.
Been hearing some strange tales of the Jarl's children. Say the one's turning wicked, and the others have an ill-favored look to them.
By Sithis, help me!
Come on, just open.
I can't get it open.
Can't say that I have.
I think I almost got it.
Find anything worthwhile yet?
Quiet! I think I heard something.
I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's move on.
You've been at it for five minutes. Here, let me try.
This place has had you shaking in your armor ever since we arrived.
This is getting ridiculous. If we can't get this open soon, the boss will have our heads.
Couldn't be busier.
How's the training going?
Let's just hope it stays this way for a long time.
Better than ever. With the Guild back on its feet, there's more coin to throw around. How about you?
Does Dravynea know?
Found another one of those vents in back near the scaffold.
She hasn't had a chance to look at it yet. Just be careful over there.
Don't patronize me!
Get out of my face!
Go on, get out of here!
Go wrong? Go wrong?
Everything is wrong! Everything! Whatever you have at that College has completely interfered with our work here.
Good. Honor to you.
The honor will be mine.
Ha! That's my girl.
Not now, I'm working.
Oh, there's a better way.
Sing you a special song tonight, beautiful lass?
Better yet, she won't make my head ring the morning after.
A buxom barmaid between the sheets will keeps me plenty warm.
Bah. You're always working. Why else would I spend so much time here?
Mikael is quite the songbird. Maybe he's the reason you're here all the time.
Oh Jon, darling. You know you're the only stone-biting, knuckle-dragging Nord for me.
Perhaps it's because there's no better way to face the cold Skyrim nights than with a belly full of ale?
Aye, the bard's got talent, I'll give him that. You just make sure his music is the only thing you're admiring.
He's deceiving you.
We can't hold them! Go, Casimir! Run!
Keep going, Casimir! Release the Miasma!
Release the Miasma! Release it now! Hurry, Casimir, hurry!
We can't hold them back! Go! Get to the Barrier! Release the Miasma!
When the ritual's complete, the Skull will be free and then Erandur will turn on you.
Quickly! Kill him now. Kill him and claim the Skull for your own! Vaermina commands you!
Hello, Fralia dear.
Perfect, my dear. Absolutely perfect. I'll see you then.
Lillith - always a pleasure. Just browsing, or were you looking for something particular?
When I get home, I'll have him start on it right away. Come back to pick it up in, oh... three days?
Ahhh, I see. I think I know just what you need. I don't have anything like that here now, but my Eorlund - he can make you one right quick.
Funny you should ask. I'm in the market for a new locket. Something in polished silver, maybe. Big enough to hold, say, a folded-up letter?
Help me! A vampire!
Please, someone help me!
Another victim fell for our ruse!
Hurry, cut me down!
You! Please, help me!
I want to get to my son. He's all I have left.
I do not like fish.
Okay. Well. That's all I've got.
A war veteran should be respected.
Jawanan, I don't see you here often.
I am buying a fish for Noster. He likes fish.
A sale's a sale but I have to know... why are you buying something for Noster?
I give, and I give.
I shall do my best.
I'll pass it along.
They aren't my boys. Do I look like the leadin' type?
You need to tell your boys to place nice, Delvin. Almost threw two of them into the well last night.
You know what I mean. Tell your boss that rough is rough, but when someone pulls a dagger fun time is over.
I'm sure. I'm sure.
Sorries don't help anyone.
We will make do somehow. We always have.
He'll be fine, I just hate worrying about his worrying.
I'm sure we'll get our gold at some point. Not like he has anywhere to go.
I can take care of myself. A Whiterun woman learns how to handle a few idiot men early in life.
It's just business.
Ha ha. If it was like that she wouldn't be asking for you, she'd be calling on the Dark Brotherhood.
Listen. All of you!
My... my what, now?
Oh, just a matter of finding the right suppliers.
Niranye, I just have to know -- what is your secret?
I'll consider it. Many of the people I deal with are... secretive. You know how it is.
Well, I'll want to meet them next time they're around. Maybe you can give an introduction.
You know. Where do you get your goods? I am always amazed at how you manage to sell things so cheaply.
Of course! I undersand completely. You just put us in a room, and I'll do all the talking. No worries at all.
Now you're talking.
Oh, if you see Shadr, remind him he still owes me that debt.
Of course you will.
Of course, my lord.
Let me know if you hear anything more substantial?
Sir, there continues to be unrest in the Gray Quarter.
They don't seem to be very sympathetic to our cause, sir.
Blasted dark elves. I don't suppose you could tell them that I presently have larger concerns? Such as all of Skyrim?
Oh! Oh... no... No!
What? What do you mean?
Okay, there you go.
Make up your mind already.
Are you sure? Once I exchange it for you, I'm not taking it back... unless you want to sell it at a discount of course.
Please get me home!
Are you here to save me?
Push off, will you?
You must be new. We don't talk to each other here.
You here to see Rulindil, too, eh? None of my business of course.
Right away, milady.
Right away, milord.
Ruki? Where is she?
Sorry to hear that.
Sweltering in here.
Again with the mead!
How do you stay cheery down in these blazes?
I'd like the fresh air better, but this isn't so bad.
I don't know. Maybe because it makes the mead taste that much better at night.
Talos preserve you.
You should wait until night fall before trying to sneak in. Talos preserve you.
That Cicero feller?
Why can't he just leave us alone?
Is something wrong. [QUOTE]Is something wrong?[QUOTE] he asks. Yes, something is bloody well wrong!
Is something wrong. [QUOTE]Is something wrong?[QUOTE] she asks. Yes, something is bloody well wrong!
Or maybe you missed the demented little man in the jester's garb, down by the road? Goes by the name of Cicero?
Hmph. Tell me something I don't know. Crazy fool's already asked me about five times. Seems he's not satisfied with my answer.
Crazy fool's asked me to fix his broken wagon wheel five times. He won't take no for an answer. Why can't he just leave us alone?
That was delicious.
It's not really a fair comparison, if you ask me.
Well, I did see something interesting not long ago.
I'll not argue that. Heard any interesting gossip lately?
Is it good fortune? The blessings of the Divines? Who knows?
You speak truly. Have you heard any interesting rumors of late?
They seem to think it's at least a dozen, but I'm sure they're exaggerating.
Now that I think on it, I did hear something rather interesting the other day.
Yes, I agree with you. Have you heard any news from the other parts of Skyrim?
I couldn't agree more. By the way, have you heard any interesting rumors lately?
I know just what you mean. Heard anything interesting lately? Any news or gossip?
Fralia Gray-Mane is convinced that the Battle-Borns have abducted one of her sons.
After all, Eorlund works the Skyforge. How is any smith going to compete with that?
These Stormcloaks are nothing more than an armed mob. This war won't last much longer.
I look forward to the day when this rebellion is put down, and we once again have peace.
I hope they'll serve the roast venison with bittergreen sauce that we had at the last party.
It's been a brutal winter. I can't remember the last time it was this cold, and for this long.
Well, I did hear that the Argonians have been banned from living inside the walls of Windhelm.
Of course, she would never admit such a thing. Captain Safia is far too proud a woman for that.
I heard Elenwen say she's going open a bottle of her best Firebrand Wine later. I can hardly wait.
This war has taken a toll on the merchants of Skyrim. Let's hope that it ends soon, for their sake.
I'll wager it was Ulfric himself that started the rumor. Maybe he thought it would bolster recruitment.
I heard those mages up in Winterhold have been trying to figure out how many dragons there are in Skyrim.
Have you visited Rorikstead lately? No matter how harsh the winter, the crops that grow there never falter.
You've got to admire their courage, doing something like that with dragons on the loose and a war going on.
Even when every other farm in the hold is barely scraping by, the harvest at Rorikstead is always bountiful.
Some say the ship suffered damage to her hull when she struck an iceberg, and Captain Safia can't afford the repairs.
The Gray Quarter in Windhelm is little better than a slum. It's shameful that the dark elves are made to live that way.
With the soldiers all fighting in the war, there's nobody to hunt down the bandits. Travel has become dangerous of late.
They're only allowed on the city docks now. Most of them sleep together in one building, and they're as poor as wretches.
Apparently, the Red Wave has been docked in Solitude for well over a month, and with no sign of shipping out any time soon.
They're probably trying to scare us into giving them more money and influence, so they can save us from the dragons threat.
I couldn't have said it better myself. It's been some time since I've had news from elsewhere in Skyrim. What have you heard?
Well, I did hear that Ulfric Stormcloak was slain while defending Windhelm against a dragon, but it sounds too good to be true.
Well, there might be nothing to it, but I've heard that the feud between the Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns in Whiterun has grown ugly.
I'm not sure that it's news, but lately it seems like every blacksmith in Skyrim is out to prove that he's the equal of Eorlund Gray-Mane.
There were several Khajiit camped outside the walls of Whiterun. Seems they've been traveling around the whole of Skyrim peddling their wares.
The defiler waxes!
You have found my beacon.
A new supplicant approaches.
A new hand touches the beacon.
Fool! He is perverting my Light.
Return my beacon to Mount Kilkreath.
But first, you must restore to me my beacon.
Take my beacon to the mount above Kilkreath.
It is time for my splendor to return to Skyrim.
If they love me not, how can my love reach them?
Can you not hear me? Are your ears full of hate?
A Light that could illuminate Skyrim and her people.
Do you prefer heedlessness to my luminous glory? Go!
Go now, with haste. Take my beacon to Mount Kilkreath.
And I will make you the instrument of my cleansing light.
Restore to me my beacon, that I might guide you toward your destiny.
It is done. The defiler is defeated. Take Dawnbreaker from its pedestal.
But it is not time for rejoicing. The defiler continues to profane my temple.
I shall guide you unto it. Find it and return here. And great shall be your reward.
Malkoran has forced the doors shut. But this is my temple, and it responds to my decree.
I will send down a ray of light. Guide this light through my temple and its doors will open.
Return to my figure on Mount Kilkreath, and I shall make you the instrument of my cleansing light.
Look at my temple, lying in ruins. So much for the constancy of mortals, their crafts and their hearts.
But the token of my truth lies buried in the ruins of my once great temple, now tainted by a profane darkness skittering within.
The... the Gourmet?
Never! I don't know what led you here, but nothing will betray my trust. I'll take the secret of the Gourmet's identity to my grave.
This is for Haldyn!
Uncle Alvor! Hello!
Sigrid! We have company!
Go ahead, see for yourself.
Are you in some kind of trouble?
Husband. Let him tell his story.
What's going on? And who's this?
Hush, child. Don't pester your cousin.
Shor's bones, what happened to you, boy?
Go on, Hadvar. Let's hear the rest of it.
Good luck. If you get a chance, look me up in Solitude.
Hadvar, thank Talos! Your friend told me about Helgen...
Hadvar? What are you doing here? Are you on leave from...
Things look quiet enough here. Come on. There's my uncle.
Mage, eh? Well, to each his own. It's not for me to judge.
Now, then, boy. Helgen was destroyed? How did you get away?
A dragon? That's... ridiculous. You aren't drunk, are you boy?
We were stopped in Helgen when we were attacked... by a dragon.
I need to get back to Solitude and let them know what's happened.
I thought you could help us out. Food, supplies, a place to stay.
Listen, as far as I'm concerned you've already earned your pardon.
Well, I'd better get back to work. You two make yourselves at home.
Be careful on the way to Solitude. Damn Stormcloaks could be anywhere.
Mara's mercy! A dragon... in Helgen? Why, it could be here at any moment!
Thief, eh? It's never too late to take charge of your own fate, you know.
When he shows up here and vouches for you, then I'll see what I can do for you.
I don't know where to start. You know I was assigned to General Tullius's guard.
Hadvar, did you really see a dragon? What did it look like? Did it have big teeth?
Shh.. Uncle, please. Keep your voice down. I'm fine. But we should go inside to talk.
Of course! Any friend of Hadvar's is a friend of mine. I'm glad to help however I can.
Come on inside. Sigrid will get you something to eat and you can tell us what happened.
Well, I'd better get some sleep. Don't mind me, though. You two make yourselves at home.
Warrior, good! I knew you shouldn't have been on that cart the minute I laid eyes on you.
We'd better keep moving. I feel like that dragon might be up there watching us right now.
It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I wouldn't have made it without your help today.
Not much more to tell. This dragon flew over and just wrecked the whole place. Mass confusion.
Closest town from here is Riverwood. My uncle's the blacksmith there. I'm sure he'd help you out.
He's a friend. Saved my life in fact. Come on, I'll explain everything, but we need to go inside.
She's a friend. Saved my life in fact. Come on, I'll explain everything, but we need to go inside.
Okay, okay. Come inside, then. Sigrid will get you something to eat and you can tell me all about it.
I don't know if anyone else got out alive. I doubt I'd have made it out myself if not for my friend here.
These are the Guardian Stones, three of the thirteen ancient standing stones that dot Skyrim's landscape.
You sure you won't change your mind? Riverwood isn't far. I'm sure my uncle will be glad to help you out.
Looks like he's gone for good this time. But I don't think we should stick around to see if he comes back.
See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. When I was a boy, that place always used to give me nightmares.
I'm sure Riverwood will be all right, dear. When the Jarl learns what's happened, he's sure to send soldiers.
Listen, you should go to Solitude and join up with the Imperial Legion. We could really use someone like you.
Hadvar! We've been so worried about you! Come, you two must be hungry. Sit down and I'll get you something to eat.
Now, then, boy. What's the big mystery? What are you doing here, looking like you lost an argument with a cave bear?
But until we get that confirmed by General Tullius, just stay clear of other Imperial soldiers and avoid any complications, all right?
Draugr creeping down the mountain to climb through my window at night, that kind of thing. I admit, I still don't much like the look of it.
Wait... I know you.
Don't get any bright ideas.
Stop, in the name of the Jarl!
Sheathe your weapons and come quietly!
Come quietly or taste the Jarl's justice!
By order of the Jarl, I command you to halt!
You really thought you could get away with it?
That'll teach you to break the law on my watch.
I thought it was finally going to be a quiet day.
Oh, forgive me, Thane. I didn't realize it was you.
In the name of the Jarl, I'm ordering you to stand fast!
Everything here appears to be in order. You can move along now.
Since you put it that way, I think we can overlook your crime for now.
All right, all right. Just keep your voice down and don't let me catch you again.
I can make all your problems with the guards go away. But it'll cost you. What do you say?
We'll look the other way this time, but even the Jarl's influence has its limits. Be more careful.
Want to come along?
We are on the hunt.
Meat from fresh kills.
We lost everything.
We will speak more.
Yes, I have something special for you.
Yes. I have something a little different planned this time.
He has something special planned for you. Better talk to him.
Still eager to please. This is good. Skjor may be right about you.
But it's not for everyone to hear. Meet me in the Underforge tonight.
Skjor was looking for you before. Talk to him before doing anything else.
Well, I don't know.
I suppose you should go to the docks and... swim?
It's in the Solitude Inlet - that's the channel just north of the docks.
What just happened?
I... I swear I felt something rather strange just then.
What? Err, nothing!
What are you up to, Gane? Hmm?
Some days I marvel that you haven't managed to blow yourself up.
Why? What did I do?
You're going to get it, Sissel!
Papa told you to do that, not me! Now leave me alone!
I told you to weed the garden by sunset, and you didn't do it. Now you're in big trouble!
Yes sir, of course.
All right. Keep up the good work.
Let's make sure we're just as productive this month as we were last. If Bryling's happy, we're happy.
You are not worthy!
You are worthy. The knowledge is yours.
You have a visitor.
Let's move out. Time's a wasting.
I'm sure he will prove most useful.
I'm sure she will prove most useful.
Yes, Housecarl. We'll leave immediately.
I'm sure you two will get along famously.
It's just us against a dragon, is that it?
Go ahead and fill her in with all the details.
Go ahead and fill him in with all the details.
Farengar, I see you've already met my new friend here.
Of course. We'll keep Riverwood safe. You can count on it.
The Jarl has finally agreed to send you back to Riverwood.
Oh, I thought you were already on your way to Bleak Falls Barrow...
Of course, Jarl Balgruuf. You seem to have found me an able assistant.
Succeed at this, and you'll be rewarded. Whiterun will be in your debt.
I can't afford to send anyone else. And we don't know where the dragon is.
Farengar, I think I've found someone who can help you with your dragon project.
Hmm? Ah, yes, the Jarl's protege! Back from Bleak Falls Barrow? You didn't die, it seems.
Good. I'm glad you're making progress. My employers are anxious to have some tangible answers.
Your main job will be to keep an eye out and get the people to safety if the town is attacked.
What are you still doing here? The Jarl said retrieving that stone tablet is a priority. Remember?
Off to Bleak Falls Barrow with you. The Jarl is not a patient man. Neither am I, come to think of it.
Time is running, Farengar, don't forget. This isn't some theoretical question. Dragons have come back.
I don't expect the three of you to fight off a dragon by yourselves. But I do expect you to do your duty.
Yes, yes. Don't worry. Although the chance to see a living dragon up close would be tremendously valuable...
You see? The terminology is clearly First Era or even earlier. I'm convinced this is a copy of a much older text.
I don't know if you've heard, but Jarl Balgruuf said my work is a priority. Which means you should be on your way.
Now, let me show you something else I found... very intriguing... I think your employers may be interested as well...
This is a priority now. Anything we can use to fight this dragon, or dragons. We need it, quickly. Before it's too late.
Perhaps dating to just after the Dragon War. If so, I could use this to cross-reference the names with other later texts.
Go to Bleak Falls Barrow, find this tablet - no doubt interred in the main chamber - and bring it to me. Simplicity itself.
Oh, have no fear. The Jarl himself has finally taken an interest, so I'm now able to devote most of my time to this research.
I, ah, learned of a certain stone tablet said to be housed in Bleak Falls Barrow - a [QUOTE]Dragonstone,[QUOTE] said to contain a map of dragon burial sites.
You have done well.
I have the knowledge I need. And so you may have your stone back, and also please take this.
You have my thanks.
You could have warned me you were baiting me into a trap.
But you're right. This should scatter the rest of them. I can go back to my life for now.
You need something?
Don't worry, citizen. I'm on top of that little matter we discussed.
I'll soon arrange transportation for our little friend. Don't worry, he'll rot in a cell and pay for what he's done.
You don't want to go up to that farmhouse, citizen. It's a terrible sight. The farmer and his wife, slaughtered in the night. So many knife wounds...
You never can tell.
The guy in from Dragon Bridge? He didn't seem the type.
I'll need a whole crate of fruit. That Varnius Junius went through quite a few of our supplies.
You're still alive!
Come. Face your end.
I'll be right with you.
Gods, what have we done?
What are we waiting for?
Wo meyz wah dii vul junaar?
Just another minute, please.
What was that thing, anyway?
Agreed. We all stay together.
How long can we keep this up?
I knew you'd come eventually.
I had no choice, don't you see?
I'm as ready as I'm going to be.
You'll defeat Ancano, won't you?
But now it all comes out again...
I can't believe we're doing this.
We thought it would be so simple.
I hope you know what you're doing.
You only face failure once more...
Come on, you can make it. Let's go.
We're not going to make it, are we?
...I'm sorry, friends. I'm so sorry!
How much worse is this going to get?
Nivahriin muz fent siiv nid aaz het.
No, no. You just stay here and rest.
Are we truly sure this is a good idea?
We need to get in there and stop this!
Have you returned, Aren? My old friend?
I don't think going back is a good idea.
We shouldn't have left her there to die!
Where's Elvali? She was right behind me.
Get to the College, before it's too late!
We stay together, no matter what. Agreed?
Let's just get inside, see what's in there.
What happened after was my fault. All mine.
This is going to be terrible for business...
I hope whatever you're going to do will work.
Can you imagine the kind of power behind this?
We've got to find a way to put a stop to this.
Do you seek to finish that which you could not?
This is insanity. We never should've come here.
You really think the Staff of Magnus is the key?
Not until we're all ready. We have to go together.
Come on, we can't stop now. We have to keep moving!
We... we have to go back. We can't leave Girduin...
I've never seen anything like this, in all my years.
What are we going to do? How do we save the College?
Savos is right. We can make it if we just stay alert.
J'zargo knows that you will save the College. You must.
We never should have pulled that thing out of Saarthal.
Don't forget, this whole idea was Atmah's to begin with.
We barely made it out alive, and you want to go back in?
Against six College-trained mages? I think we'll be fine.
I've no idea what killed her, but I'm sure something did.
This is it, you know. Through this door. Can you feel it?
If we can't stop this, what happens to the rest of Skyrim?
Can you imagine the looks on their faces when we come back?
Come on, we're finally here! Let's not waste any more time!
And what if... What if there are things guarding this place?
Do you think Ancano knew all along what the Eye was capable of?
You... You are not Aren, are you? Has he sent you in his place?
You do not answer... Must I use this guttural language of yours?
We can't go back. Might as well go forward. We can still do this.
We'll be back at the College before anyone even knows we're gone.
You would care about that, since you're the Arch-Mage's favorite!
It's too late. There isn't enough of him left to go back in after.
There were six of us. Full of ambition, eager to conquer the world.
You want to stay here, fine. But the rest of us aren't giving up now.
You're right. This is all my fault. Should we turn around, head back?
You keep talking like you're sure we'll find something useful in here.
I can't lose all my research. There has to be a way to save the College.
We could have turned back. It could have ended there. But we kept going.
Dead. Something grabbed her from behind. Gone before I could do anything.
Girduin died first. It happened so fast, none of us had a chance to react.
I... I don't know why I pressed the others on, convinced them to keep going.
J'zargo is sure this is the end. And this was supposed to be a safe place...
None of our spells were potent enough, none of our wills were strong enough.
We'll come back for you as soon as we've reached our goal. You have my word.
I had no choice! It was the only way to make sure that monster never escaped!
I had to leave them behind, had to sacrifice them so I could make it out alive.
One moment we joked about what we'd find below, the next he'd been ripped in half.
I promise you, I'll never let this happen again! I'll seal this whole place away...
Hafnar was covered in blood, but his stupid Nord pride wouldn't let him admit defeat.
I don't care... We're going all the way in. I want to know what Shalidor hid in here.
What are you doing here? You need to get that Staff, or else we don't stand a chance!
I was in charge now. I pushed them on, insisting it would be worse to try and go back.
I never meant for any of what happened here. Tried to seal it up, lock it away forever.
Now you've put it all to rest, but it can't undo my mistakes. They can never be undone...
Going back would be the end of all of us. We keep pushing forward, and we'll make it. We will!
It was Atmah's idea to come here, at first. She talked me into it, and I convinced the others.
Given the history of this place, it's more than likely there's still some amount of power here.
If we'd all died there, if we'd loosed the thing on the world, who knows what might have happened?
What else could we do? Stay there and die with her? She refused to go on, we didn't have a choice!
Did he warn you that your own power would be your undoing? That it would only serve to strengthen me?
[QUOTE]No matter what, we stay together[QUOTE], Hafnar said. I looked him in the eyes and lied to him.
We all knew this was the end. Without even opening the door, we knew what was behind it would kill us.
There were only three of us left. Takes-In-Light just sat down and gave up, and we left her there to die.
Atmah cried to herself. Hafnar wouldn't look at either of us. And I kept telling them it would be all right.
Enchanted weapons, tomes of ancient knowledge, Shalidor's secrets themselves -- who knows what we could find!
That's how I consoled myself for years, after I'd sealed this place shut and vowed never to let anyone open it.
And then we were all fighting just to survive. None of us were prepared. It was amazing the rest of us survived.
We were sure we'd find it all here, hidden away from time. Power, knowledge... All the things we didn't want to wait for.
When it was over, Atmah, Hafnar and I stared, pale-faced, at one another, unwilling to admit we'd made a terrible mistake.
It would seem I'm bound to this place. The bitter irony of it all -- my greatest failure, and even in death I can't escape it.
[QUOTE]If we can just make it through, it'll all be worth it[QUOTE], I told them. And the fools believed the words I myself didn't trust.
Elvali died here. I don't even remember what killed her. One of the countless faceless horrors. I think she was glad, in that final moment.
You've been warned.
Your length is cut!
Into the dark with you!
Open to the will of Septimus!
Your depths will open to the mind!
Adelaisa, I'm sorry.
This must be her, then.
This must be him, then.
You beasts are the worst.
Come now, dearie, surely we aren't all that bad.
Oh, we've got other things in mind for our mouths, sweetie.
I've got a top man on the job right now. He should be returning any moment.
I've got a sharp woman on the job right now. She should be returning any moment.
Just... leave me alone! I've brought your mead, now drink it and shut your filthy mouths.
Sorry isn't good enough, Orthus. There's a lot of gold at stake here, and sniveling isn't going to get it back.
Ah, a man of action.
Ah, a woman who lets her actions speak for her. I knew there was something I liked about you.
Alain is... is dead?
Ah, well. Dead is dead. Right? My thanks to you, assassin. Here's the gold I was going to pay for the job. You earned it, after all.
I... I'm grateful. It's just this... this isn't at all how I imagined things would play out. There was Alain, but I was considering more, and...
And you avenged him.
This isn't a good time.
Let's go tell the others.
Is that? Did you repair the blade?
Kodlak did not care for vengeance.
I can't go any further, Shield-Sister.
I can't go any further, Shield-Brother.
You know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor.
That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean.
Everyone has his weakness, and this one is mine.
Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be.
No, Farkas, he didn't. And that's not what this is about.
And it's my honor to be first to address you as Harbinger.
[QUOTE]The flames of a hero can reforge the shattered.[QUOTE]
Did I hear right? Did he say you were to lead the Companions?
You're right. It's what he wanted, and he deserved to have it.
And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim.
Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death.
I'm just surprised. But your strength and honor are apparent to all.
Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas.
You've earned the right. Your strength and honor are apparent to all.
We should be honoring Kodlak, no matter our own thoughts on the blood.
There the souls of the Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel.
The rest of you, prepare to journey to the Tomb of Ysgramor. For Kodlak.
Ever since Dustman's Cairn, the big crawly ones have been too much for me.
The blade is a weapon. A tool. Tools are meant to be broken. And repaired.
I'm not proud, but I will stay back with Vilkas. Give my regards to Ysgramor.
This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Sister here.
This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Brother here.
The old man had one wish before he died. And he didn't get it. It's as simple as that.
He wanted to meet Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken from him.
As the one who bore the fragments, I think you should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into battle.
The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it will take you to meet him once more.
We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like it has been for a thousand years.
Are you ready to go?
Back so soon Xander?
Can you make some new poultices for my...you know?
You should be more careful about the women you spend time with in port. Come back later and it will be ready.
But I'm thirsty now.
My favorite drinking buddy! Let's get some mead.
Not now. If I don't pull night duty, I'll drink a round with you at the Sleeping Giant.
You're always thirsty. Just like you're always drunk. Now let me get back to my rounds.
But she's so stupid!
Because she was being stupid!
Don't make me bring your father into this.
You need to take better care of your sister.
She said you threw her into a goat pen yesterday.
Court is in session.
I'm trying to speak to the Jarl.
Please don't interrupt the court.
Don't talk such rot.
What? You're out of your mind. That old coot's more interested in dead dwarves than anybody around here.
Get out of my face.
What's a milk drinker like you doing out here? Go home to your mother.
Get your ward ready.
I think I see what I was doing wrong...
Come on. I don't want to hit you until you have your ward ready.
All right. That should do it. I think I'm ready to try the College again. Thanks!
Great! Now I'm going to cast some spells at you. Keep your ward up so I can study it.
Glad you were here.
I can't believe we're the only ones who survived.
Glad you were here. Couldn't have done it without you!
Break our men out and head to the courtyard. We'll meet you there.
Great work! Get back and report our success. I'll stay here and clean up the mess.
I guess... I'll hold down the fort by my lonesome. Hurry back and tell them to send a garrison. Quickly!
Hey there! Can you believe this place? So cold my breath turns to icicles! What are we even doing up here?
Guess Tullius wants to make sure everything's locked down before launching a serious campaign for Eastmarch.
You go report our success. I'll set up a garrison here. A shame none of the prisoners made it, but their names will be remembered.
Anyway, I'm glad you're here. We're outnumbered again, more so than when we took that wagon. But if we work together, we can pull this off.
Gods, you're boring!
Who said anything about trouble? Now get out of my face.
Good luck out there!
Good luck out there.
Good. Now get going.
Got any ale or mead?
Ha, enjoy the Chill.
It's off to Cidhna Mine for you.
I guess you're smarter than you look.
You're going to rot in the Dragonsreach Dungeon.
A stretch in the Castle Dour Dungeon will straighten you right out.
You'll never see the sun again. No one escapes Cidhna Mine. No one.
He he. Thanks, papa.
You really think I can be a blacksmith someday, papa? As good as Eorlund Gray-Mane? Or maybe... even as good as you?
Oh, I know it! You keep working hard, like you been doing, and you could be the greatest blacksmith Skyrim has ever seen.
Here's your payment.
Congratulations. You slaughtered an emaciated beggar in cold blood. You are truly an opponent to be feared.
Hmph. Suit yourself.
How are you, Drevis?
Ugh. What do you want?
I'm busy right now, Colette.
Well, then. Fine. Have a nice day.
Why should I want anything? Why can't I simply be sociable with my colleagues?
I do... I do indeed.
Keening, one of the great tools of Kagrenac himself, is finally in my possession. I don't think I really believed this day would come.
I guess I was wrong.
And here I figured you as one who enjoyed our special gifts.
I have faith in you.
But, if you find more trouble than you can handle, run out to the courtyard. We'll come as soon as we hear fighting.
I remember that axe.
Now that guy was nuts.
I knew I could trust you!
We should go get the axe.
Clavicus sent you didn't he?
All this just to kill me Clavicus?
And I was so close to being rid of you.
Now, as for your wish... Power, was it?
Don't bother, Clavicus won't talk to me.
Let's get the axe and be done with this.
Wait a second, there's another option here.
You can't have the Axe! It's all I have left now!
Now, as for your wish... An end to the war, was it?
You're worth putting in the extra effort for, pooch.
Don't worry. I'll make sure he sees the light. I trusted you, now you trust me.
I have a feeling I'm not going to like what happens when we get back to Clavicus.
Oh, fine. Have my boon and be done with it. I've got more interesting deals to make, anyway.
Yeah, yeah, dog gets master, master gets cosmic axe, everyone's happy. Just get over here, mutt.
Vile! None of that - you made a deal, and the mortal stood by it honestly. Now it's your turn to come through.
It's a shame you wished for something so dull as me taking back the mutt. Quite the lack of imagination on your part.
I'll make sure this war ends, all right. Just as soon as the dragons swarm across Skyrim and wipe out all of you puny...
Ah, that feels so much better! You forget how nice supreme power feels until you've been stuck in a cave for a few years.
A lack of ambition like that really ought to be punished. Perhaps by turning you into a worm, or maybe a few decades of...
You can be a part of a tremendous power - all you have to do is let your soul be absorbed by this axe. I never said it would be your power...
I'll think about it.
I continue to hear things about dragon sightings in Skyrim.
Would you like me to send someone? Faralda or Phinis, perhaps?
Dragons? Well, that's fascinating. We should have someone look into that.
I'm counting on you.
It won't be a waste.
We follow our hearts.
And we gave it to Elisif?
And we gave it to Erikur?
But, if we found it first...
Not everyone's agreed to the Moot.
Tell me again, why I'm wasting men chasing after a fairy tale.
In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize her claim.
In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize his claim.
So what - Ulfric gets this crown and then suddenly he's High King?
You've been here long enough to know that Nords aren't always sensible.
The Stonefist's no fool. He's found the Crown. But we'll get to it first.
We're backing Elisif. When the Moot meets, they'll do the sensible thing.
We're backing Erikur. When the Moot meets, they'll do the sensible thing.
If Ulfric gets his hand on that crown, it won't be a fairy tale. It'll be a problem.
Don't you Nords put any stock in your own traditions? I thought the Moot chose the king.
No, it's not as simple as that, but the Jagged Crown would be a potent symbol for his cause to rally around.
Make sure you take the Auxiliary here. You can send her back when you get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.
Make sure you take the Auxiliary here. You can send him back when you get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.
Perhaps... I'm entrusting you with what resources I can spare. But I'm warning you, if this turns out to be a waste of time and men...
Kind of sad, really.
It's like... he wants to talk. Likes people and all. But he stays separate, because he's supposed to.
Well he don't like company, I can tell you that much. Just wants to be left alone. But no... that's not really it.
Leave me alone, Lod.
Ah Tekla, you're a pretty little mouse.
Alright, but if you ever want to leave that old curmudgeon I've got plenty for you to do at Gentle Repose.
Mmm. That felt nice.
Huh. I feel better now.
No need to do that now.
Ah! That felt refreshing.
Hey! My hangover is gone!
What...hey! That felt good.
My thanks. I feel... better.
Save it for the battlefield.
Suddenly I feel much better.
That put a spring in my step.
Ah! What did you do? Stop that!
Huh? What...oh! That felt nice.
Wow! What was that? Do it again!
A healing spell? Are you a priest?
Hmm. Feel a bit better now. Thanks.
My old bones don't hurt so much now.
Ah! I feel like I just woke from a nap.
Was that some sort of... healing spell?
I hope you're not expecting a thank you.
Hey! You trying to pull a fast one on me?
Thanks! Not sure it was necessary, though.
A healing spell? Was that really necessary?
Healing spells always leave me light-headed...
I wasn't hurt, but that did make me feel better.
Healing magic? An Orc lets her wounds heal naturally...
You heal away my scars and there's gonna be a problem...
Don't go casting spells on a woman without asking her permission.
I suppose you think you're better than me because you can do that?
No. Oh, please no...
Not even for a look.
Aye, a whole heap of it. You see that Temple? Way up there?
All them women, keeping to themselves. Won't let poor Degaine in, no.
But they've got a treasure in there. Gold statue, size of a child. Who knows what they use it for, but I know what I'll use it for.
Not here. Follow me.
Close the door, then we can talk.
So you're the Dragonborn I've been hearing so much about.
The Greybeards seem to think you're the Dragonborn. I hope they're right.
Not now. Stay alert.
This is no time for idle talk.
This place is sure to make us rich!
We're in this together. Stay close.
Eyes open. Danger could be anywhere.
Let's clear the place out first. Then we'll gather our loot.
Not too bad, I hope?
Imedhnain, I was just comparing the ledgers from last season.
Worse. The loss of shipments from Forsworn attacks are really hitting us hard.
Now that is a shame.
Now it's time to face the consequences of your actions. You don't leave this shack until someone dies.
But what you fail to realize is that you involved yourself in this [QUOTE]insanity[QUOTE] when you took Grelod's life. You made your choice.
Of mine? What is it?
No visitors. No way. Now piss off, before ya' make me mad.
Officially, nothing.
Well, it's a... minor stain on the College's reputation. One of many, unfortunately.
He's still in town, getting by plying spells to the people inside the Frozen Hearth. Disgraceful.
If you're so curious, talk to Nelacar, in the Frozen Hearth. He can tell you the whole sad story.
There was some bother about a group of mages being exiled. I can't remember what the details were.
You shouldn't ask me. There's an Altmer named Nelacar in the Frozen Hearth. He's the one to talk to.
The kind of things that even the College won't tolerate. Things that can get a wizard exiled for life.
It was a few years ago. A few of the mages got overconfident and were exiled. They had no talent, anyway.
There's an Altmer who's staying at the Frozen Hearth. Nelacar. You should speak with him, if you're so curious.
I hear one of them, Nelacar, still hangs around the Frozen Hearth. Guess he has no where else to go, poor thing.
There was an... unfortunate incident a few years ago. An elven mage named Nelacar was exiled from the College over it.
Oh, no, I'm not falling for that one again. Next thing I know, I'm getting yelled at for saying something inappropriate.
I think one of them came back. Nelacar. Stays at the Frozen Hearth, but I don't know why. He's not welcome in the College.
Why don't you head into town and get a drink at the Frozen Hearth? I hear old Nelacar still has a room there. He knows a lot of stories, that one.
You should head to the Frozen Hearth and speak with Nelacar. It's his story to tell, and I wouldn't want to discredit him by talking behind his back.
Oh my. How precious.
So there's nothing more to be said.
I've already made it very clear that all of my trades are final.
Onmund is too afraid to deal with me himself, and so he's sent you.
I'll make this very simple for you. All my trades are final. Onmund knew this ahead of time, and went through with it anyway.
Oh, didn't you know?
Oh, you old charmer.
Who says I've settled down?
So, Roggi, when are you going to get yourself a woman?
Oh, I'm not sure I could ever settle down like you have, friend.
I think this is yet another conversation that wouldn't make your wife happy.
That's just it... if she's not happy, there are plenty of other women who will be.
Oh! You behave, now!
I'm sorry. What would you like to talk about?
Hows about we figure out some way to keep warm tonight?
Elda, honey, let's not talk about the war. It's in the past.
Tell me about the Great War. I hear you were in the battle of...
Okay, what'll it be?
Got plenty, take your pick.
Good, we could use the coin.
Got more than you can handle.
Great. What do you want to do?
I bet you are. Which one do you want?
Good, my clients are gettin' impatient.
Bloody good timin'. Just got some more clients.
If break-ins are more your thing, go talk to Vex.
All right, anythin' in particular strike your fancy?
'Bout time. Brynjolf's been gettin' on me about money.
You're not getting anything until you pay the Guild back.
Let me make this plain and simple. No more jobs until you pay Vex. No get to it.
Aren't you supposed to be in Markarth? Finish that job and we'll talk about more.
I want you to finish that job in Whiterun first. Then we'll talk about more work.
I think you should finish that special assignment Delvin gave you, then we'll talk.
Before I'm goin' to give you any more work, you need to finish that job in Solitude.
I handle the fishin', numbers and bedlam jobs... the ones with the more personal touch.
I handle the burglary, shill, sweep and heist jobs. Most of them involve breaking and entering.
If you don't like that kind of work, talk to Delvin. He runs the more up-close and personal jobs.
Slow down, you have that special request in Windhelm to finish first. After that's done, I'll send you some more jobs.
Paaz. A fair answer.
Ro fus... maybe you only balance the forces that work to quicken the end of this world.
Even we who ride the currents of Time cannot see past Time's end. Wuldsetiid los tahrodiis.
Those who try to hasten the end, may delay it. Those who work to delay the end, may bring it closer.
Please, cut me down!
Run fast, my friend.
Something to report?
I trust this is something important?
There isn't someone less busy who can help you?
Make it quick. I get enough delays from politicians.
The General and I have our disagreements, but he's the best hope for both the Empire and Skyrim.
Many of my countrymen joined the rebels. They can't see the big picture. Skyrim needs the Empire as much as it needs us.
Thank you, my chief.
Your muscles ripple when you work the forge. It's pleasing.
That's for the best.
That's more like it.
The Elder Council...
Was Mallory willing to buy the amulet?
Oh, now that explains quite a bit. Motierre, you naughty, naughty boy. Hiring the Dark Brotherhood to help you rise beyond your station. Delicious.
Then we have a deal.
In his later years, Andoril moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild. He prefered the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments.
Think nothing of it.
Oh dear. What should I do?
Oh, thank the gods you're in Windhelm, Calixto!
Bring it to me straight away when you find it. Don't dally. I can keep it safe.
Of course, my dear. It may prove to be quite the curiosity! One must always be alert.
Calixto, someone left an interesting ring in here a few weeks ago. Would you like a look?
Be very careful with that. It sounds as if it may be the Death Ring of Dro'farahn. A ring of the most dangerous sort.
Well, I seem to have misplaced it at the moment. But it was white, like alabaster, with three bright rubies set in it.
Too much... can't...
Lady Mara... preserve me...
I've failed you... forgive me...
No... not when we're so close...
Can't fail now... must hang on...
Lady Mara... I await your embrace...
Very well, Listener.
As you wish, Listener.
Oh, all right then, Listener. Cicero will just carry on with what he was doing. Until you say otherwise.
We'll soon find out.
Is that confidence, or bravado? Confidence I can use. Bravado gets soldiers killed.
We're not done here.
Well, yes. Probably.
The Council will be informed of this. They will find out what you're up to.
I mean, yes. Certainly it is, but that doesn't matter now, because I know you're hoarding something even more important at your College.
What a waste. Fools.
Where have you been?
Why didn't you then?
Hello Bolli. How's the fishing?
Bountiful. Although I would like to have anchored a bit closer to Goldenglow Estate.
When I got close, the mercenaries Aringoth hired to protect the estate just waved me off. I don't think he wants visitors anymore.
Yes, I recognize it.
Well, I suppose I needn't wonder where he is anymore.
You can't tell them!
Please, I need your help and there isn't anyone I can trust here in the city.
Your choice, friend.
...go murder a clown.
But you know what I mean!
Yes - don't kill the Gourmet!
You're only young once. Trust me, I know.
Of course, they'd probably already be dead...
I am so very happy for you. If not a bit... envious.
Well, you know the old saying. When life gives you lemons...
Yeah. Follow my wife's orders, and don't do anything stupid.
Our actions were shameful. Surely, the Night Mother weeps this day.
I left something there for you. If you're inclined to take that approach.
And no, before you ask, it's not me. I know which side my bread is buttered on.
I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of surveying the site of the reception.
If so, the bride will probably address the crowd from the balcony. It overlooks the courtyard.
Killing him secretly will certainly make things easier on you, but if there are witnesses, so be it.
Just follow my instructions, and the Dark Brotherhood will be back on top. All thanks to you... Listener.
It took all the favors, bribes, and blackmails I could muster, but I've secured your exit out of the keep.
The contracts I dole out are fairly simple - go to a location, and kill the target. But this is different.
That said... If your attack on Virane is witnessed, those Markarth guards are going to be none too happy...
There's a small parapet, just opposite the balcony, that would prove an excellent spot for a long-range kill.
Cicero destroyed any sympathy I may have had for him when he wounded Veezara. Kill the fool and be done with it.
You've got to kill a soft little woman on her wedding day. What's next? Murdering a crippled orphan in his sleep?
Ah, killing her will be easy. She'll be so happy, she'll never see it coming. I should know, I killed a bride once.
And one more thing. Have fun. You'll be committing a dark deed, but there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy yourself.
But listen, I think I can help you. The wedding reception is outside the Temple of the Divines, right? In Solitude?
Killing Gaius Maro in a city will be challenging because of all the guards, but fights, even murder, are fairly common.
Do what I do. Walk up to your target, introduce yourself, melt their skin off, and then run like the wind. Works every time.
What's the matter, Listener? Night Mother not feeling very chatty these days? You need help from your flesh and blood lessers?
Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, sister.
I can only assume she wants to test the full breadth of your abilities. So. Be polite, and professional, and represent us well.
Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, brother.
She said that? If I find anyone working against my wife, or this Sanctuary, I'll beat them to death with their own severed head.
The last thing you need is my help. Listener or not, you've proven yourself time and again. To Astrid, to the Family... and to me.
Oho! The Listener wants my counsel! I thought you were above the opinions of mere mortals, now that you commune with dead old women.
Going after Cicero now would be a fool's errand. That little jester is currently being digested in Arnbjorn's stomach, mark my words.
What an honor, the assassination of an Emperor. And all because you are the Listener, favored by the Night Mother, anointed by Sithis.
Yes. Just because you're now a professional assassin, don't think you have to skulk around in the dark like a skeever and stab people.
Slaughtering the Emperor's cousin? At her wedding? Those guards will be out for blood. Wouldn't surprise me if the crowd jumped in too.
Remember, your target is Gaius Maro, the son. Not Commander Maro, the father! We need him alive. But the son... Ha! Scorch his face off!
Astrid has arranged for your escape, no? Then you have nothing to worry about. Get in, kill the Emperor, and get out. Then, we celebrate.
Yes, do not underestimate Cicero. A man like that, small and foolish, is easy to mock. To underestimate. Don't make the same mistake I did.
All right, so maybe I was wrong. Maybe Cicero coming here wasn't the best thing that could have happened. But even I didn't anticipate this.
The lover will likely be your target. If memory serves me correctly, he leads a group of bandits. So this may be rather interesting for you.
You're joking. While I can understand if some family members wish to honor the Old Ways once more, surely no one would oppose Astrid's rule.
Does she? Listen, sister... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid.
Ha! And would that surprise anyone? This Sanctuary's a mess. Wouldn't surprise me if somebody's talking to the fool on the sly. Making deals.
Well, there's an old statue there. I've seen it. Hanging right over where she'll be standing. Old means weak. Weak means it could fall. Hmmm?
Yes. You're killing the Emperor himself. The Dark Brotherhood will get one shot at this, and you've been given the honors. So don't screw up.
Does she? Listen, brother... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid.
Normally I talk to a victim before I end his life, but I wouldn't recommend it this time. Maro will be alert to danger. Talking may spook him.
You must speak to that Muiri woman, correct? I have heard rumors in Windhelm. She was recently implicated in a thievery, along with her lover.
Hmph. I wouldn't worry too much about this Virane giving you the information you need. Give him a good scare, and he'll squawk like a Hagraven.
Oh, I know you have to, but it makes me sad all the same. I love the Gourmet's recipes. The world will soon be a blander, less flavorful place.
You've got to track a man, kill him, and then frame him for a crime. This contract's perfect... for me. Clearly, my lovely wife made a mistake.
Hmm... Well, assuming this Gourmet is just a cook, it will probably be an easy kill. Just be discreet - alerting others will be the real threat.
Oh! Well, I hope she doesn't suspect me. I mean, I've spoken with Cicero a bit, and he's quite charming. But I'd never go against Astrid. Never.
You're being sent to meet with the contact directly, is that correct? What a most unusual occurrence. Astrid usually performs this duty herself.
I feel only pity for Cicero. He must die, of course, but can any of us truly blame him for his actions? We mocked him, disrespected the Old Ways.
I've taken the liberty of visiting the cities, and spreading some nasty rumors about Gaius Maro. To make his treachery that much more believable.
It was our honeymoon. Tepid, I said! The bathwater should be tepid! Lukewarm is not tepid! Close, maybe, but there's is a difference! Stupid cow.
Just remember Astrid's commitment to her Sanctuary, to her Family. A Family that now counts you as one of its own. Honor Astrid above all others.
So you're the Listener, hmm? Well that hardly seems fair. You just got here. The Night Mother should have spoken to me. Any idiot could see that.
Well... While it's true I prefer sorcery's more destructive nuances, we mustn't forget the many spells with simpler, more practical applications.
The jobs Astrid gives you will be more important, and usually more complex. Just keep your wits about you. And for Sithis' sake, don't get killed.
But, I will serve gladly, as that's my lot in life. Now let's see. Ah yes, Volunruud. It's an old crypt, infested with Draugr. So plan accordingly.
Don't take any chances with this one. Use the Jarrin Root to poison the Emperor's food. You're disguising yourself as a chef - it only makes sense.
If the Night Mother truly spoke to you, if you really are the Listener... your destiny was written in the Void. Astrid is right to fear your power.
It's no fair. I love weddings. Astrid should have given this contract to me. Instead, she's got me visiting cities, assessing security. How boring.
Sure, you poison the Emperor, but what then? Why not summon an Atronach to cause some chaos? Or turn invisible and slip away. Use your imagination!
The man you need to speak with, his name is Motierre? That's a very old and powerful Breton family, firmly established in Cyrodiil. Most curious...
Believe it or not, Festus likes you. He senses your power, your potential. Follow his instructions to the letter, and you may even earn his respect.
You get to kill the Emperor. The bloody Emperor. You'd better enjoy this one. You owe us all that much. So make it bloody, painful, and spectacular.
You may be the Listener, or you may just be a lunatic who's started hearing voices. Either way, Astrid is still your mistress. Not the Night Mother.
You've been directed to dispose of the Gourmet's body, is that correct? I often find water to be a suitable hiding place. A lake, a pool... the sea.
Your contract sounds simple, which means it certainly will not be. Getting into that reception will be easy, but have you thought about getting out?
To what end? Usurping Astrid's authority as leader of the Sanctuary? Hmmm... Yes, I can see her concern. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
You're headed to The Hag's Cure, right? It's a good shop. You should examine their wares. Never pass up the chance to buy a good potion... or poison.
Any luck on your end?
We've scoured the town and I've spoken to every contact we have left. No sign of Mercer.
Are you feeling sick?
You look worse than I feel.
You look awful. Better not get me sick.
You look sick. I hope it's not contagious.
How do you feel? I think you might be sick.
You all right? You look like you might be sick.
You don't look so good. Are you feeling all right?
Are you feeling all right, dear? You look a little ill.
Don't take this the wrong way, but you look a little sickly.
You look a bit peaked. You sure you shouldn't be home, in bed?
No offense, but you're not looking so good. Are you feeling ill?
You should probably be in bed. You're looking a bit under the weather.
You're looking a little rough around the edges. You feeling all right?
Are you here to help?
I will take back my family's castle.
Arkay watch over you.
Be seein' you around.
Slip up and I'll gut you like a fish.
Christer?  He's here?
Death feeds new life.
I'm sure that, in time, this little sapling will grow into a new Gildergreen that will tower over Whiterun. Thank you.
I... you're right of course. It can be hard to hear the winds of Kynareth when all you hear are the rabble in the temple.
Destroy the intruder!
Make your peace, mortal!
An intruder in the Sepulcher!
I cast shadows across your grave!
Let the darkness rip you asunder!
Defend the Sepulcher at all costs!
Nocturnal will feed upon your soul!
Defend the Ebonmere! Kill the mortal!
You've breathed your last breath, mortal!
Don't be so petulant!
In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see!
Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.
Don't worry about me.
I don't mean to confuse you.
It's not confusing... just frustrating.
You're a strong warrior, Skjor. Your heart is fiery and that serves you well in battle.
But even the bravest of men consider their actions. I want you to survive long enough to take the mantle.
Don't you dare. Ever.
Don't you... Don't you say that name to me.
Emperor Pelagius III.
Now surely even you know about Pelagius' decree? On his deathbed - oh, and this was inspired - he forbade... death! That's right! Death! Outlawed!
Finally, you're back.
Get of my house. Now.
Gods strike you down.
You. What do you want?
You're nothing but trouble.
What do you need, my friend?
You're just rotten. No good.
Divines smile on you, friend.
Azura's wisdom to you, friend.
Good to see you again, friend.
It's so good to see you again.
Good day, friend! Keeping well?
It is our most favored company.
The gods know what you've done.
What do you want, milk drinker?
You're not as dumb as you look.
It's a fine day with you around.
I hope monsters come and eat you.
Now here's a man I'm glad to see.
Just looking at you makes me upset.
Now here's a woman I'm glad to see.
Its scent is foul, unclean. Hurtful.
Now why would I want to talk to you?
You're the best! Can you be my father?
You're the best! Can you be my mother?
Here to shame an old woman? Leave me be.
Ours is to smile at your passing, friend.
Something you need, you miserable wretch?
May the gods watch over your battles, friend.
You. Every time I look at you my blood boils.
I hope the wilds claim you, one of these days.
May your next fight bring you victory, friend.
May your weapons be sharp and your prey fresh.
So nice to have pleasant company for a change.
What do you want? You've caused enough trouble.
My favorite drinking buddy. Let's get some mead.
Filth. Run to the horizon before I hunt you down.
I should bash your face in after all you've done.
Leave me alone. Can't an old man have some peace?
Good to see you. Finally someone useful is around.
I don't mean you any trouble. Just leave me alone.
It annoys us. What does it want to take from us now?
You're someone who can get things done. I like that.
Worthless. Everyone like you is completely worthless.
You want to talk to me? After everything you've done?
You've been a good friend to me. That means something.
Well, look at you. If only everyone acted like you did.
You have something to say, dog? Something on your mind?
It fills us with rage. What harm does it bring to us now?
There are so many delightful ways I've pictured you dead.
Friends like you are hard to find and very valuable to me.
There are so few pleasures in life as fine as your company.
Absolutely no time to deal with lowlifes these days. Go away.
Divines bless you. May the ground you walk quake as you pass.
What do you want? Aren't your hands coated with enough blood?
You! You're going to hurt me again aren't you? Just stay away.
You're mean. I hate you. I hate you forever and ever and ever.
We're one of the same kind, you and I. I'm glad to have met you.
Good to see you. At least you know how to treat someone properly.
I don't like talking to someone who holds their honor so cheaply.
I've had just about all I'm willing to take from you. What is it?
A fine day to you, friend. May you die with a sword in your hands.
Khajiit wishes for you to go away. You have done us too much harm.
For your crimes, may Malacath boil your blood and grind your bones.
Good to have you by my side, friend. I need reliable people around.
You and me, we're the only people around who aren't complete fools.
These sands are cold, but Khajiit feels warmness from your presence.
I hope your parents are proud of you. They have a lot of reason to be.
Oh, it's you. I was wondering why I was smelling something unpleasant.
Speak. Khajiit will listen until all the sugars in the world turn sour.
Good to see Skyrim still has such fine people. You give an old man hope.
I bet you could slay one of those mean old dragons. I bet you could do anything.
Every time I think of you, I imagine a Saber Cat closing its claws around your face.
Good work. Take this.
What's this? Some kind of code? [QUOTE]Need as much iron ore as you can dig up....[QUOTE]
He's not spying, but it's clear the Empire is making Lod smith up more swords and armor for them.
Thank you so much. Here. Let me show you a thing or two about not attracting attention to yourself.
This should come in handy. Here. Let me show you a few tricks I've learned about buttering up royalty.
Haven't up until now.
Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room.
Hold, on there. I think I just remembered something. The last time we handed out pay.
Here, have one on me.
Yeah, my problem is I'm too tired to punch your face in.
No, no. Sorry if I sounded so mean there. My brother always said I have a big mouth.
Hmm. Yes, here it is.
Shadows preserve us. So it's true...
Farewell, Enthir... words can't express...
Hmm. This is intriguing, but highly disturbing.
Does the journal say where this wealth came from?
It's alright Karliah. You don't have to say a word.
Anything else, Enthir? Anything about... the Nightingales?
I'm not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher. What is it? What's Mercer Frey done?
It appears that Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the Guild for months.
I'm sorry Enthir, I can't say. All that matters is we deliver your translation to the Guild immediately.
Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.
Yes. Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the Guild's treasury without anyone's knowledge.
The last few pages seem to describe [QUOTE]the failure of the Nightingales[QUOTE] although it doesn't go into great detail.
Gallus had begun to uncover what he calls an [QUOTE]...unduly lavish lifestyle replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures.[QUOTE]
How nice to meet you.
Well? What's it going to be?
So, you're the one who barged into my home and laid waste to my projects.
How's business today?
I'll be sure to tell her.
We've got another dozen ripening on the vine. They should be ready in a few days.
Well enough, I suppose. Nilsine bought up most of the tomatoes, and was asking if we could get more.
How's the mine today?
As usual. I've always got an eye on the rocks.
Not too bad. Careful around the more obvious scorchers.
I am at your service.
Congratulations, boss!
We'll chat after the ceremony.
Not now, it's time for the ceremony.
We're all rich thanks to you. Cheers!
We can speak after the ceremony's done.
I promise to live up to your expectations.
Shouldn't the ceremony be completed first?
We can talk after the Guild Master ceremony.
Hang on. When the ceremony's done, we'll talk.
So now the pupil is the master, eh? Good show!
Wait until the ceremony is over, then we'll talk.
Glad to see they picked the right person for the job.
Not yet... wait until Brynjolf's finished the ceremony.
We can get better acquainted once the ceremony's ended.
Don't talk to me, you're supposed to be at the ceremony!
Well, looks like you're running the show now. Good luck.
I think everyone's waiting for the ceremony to get going.
I can't think of a better person for the job, Nightingale.
We'll talk later... after this whole ceremony thing's over.
As long as you continue to make us all rich, I'm behind you.
You need anything, anything at all... don't hesitate to ask.
I suppose congratulations are in order. Now don't screw it up.
Not now, you idiot. We'll talk after this ridiculous ceremony.
I'm not getting any younger. Let's get this ceremony done with.
So, now that you're Guild Master, how about drinks for all of us!
What are you doing? You're supposed to be attending the ceremony.
I suppose you deserve it. Couldn't do any worse than Mercer, anyway.
After Brynjolf has installed you as Guild Master, we can speak at length.
Here's to a long and prosperous future... may the Guild last another hundred years.
I look forward to it.
I need more children.
Bolar, I must ask you something.
Well, that's a different matter...
Oh, all things in time, my boy. All things in time.
What more do you need that Yatul and I cannot provide?
Have the spirits told you where I may find a wife? One who will be safe from this curse?
I said let's go. Now.
I sense a presence...
Hmm? Does someone live among the dead?
I'll do my best, sir.
Tulvur! I've just completed inspection of the farmhouse.
Well, sir, it's a farmhouse. It's not going to be as clean as your house in the city.
It's filthy in there! Dirt everywhere, and it looks like the dogs have the run of the place.
I just know that our sailors are able to keep their ship quarters clean, and I expect the same of you.
I'll see you at home.
I would like to officially extend to you an invitation to join my Family. The Dark Brotherhood.
In the southwest reaches of Skyrim, in the Pine Forest, you'll find the entrance to our Sanctuary. It's just beneath the road, hidden from view.
Of course. And you've repaid your debt, in full.  Here's the key to the shack. But why stop here? I say we take our relationship to the next level.
When questioned by the Black Door, answer with the correct passphrase: [QUOTE]Silence, my brother.[QUOTE] Then you're in. And your new life begins.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm right behind you.
Then lead on, friend.
Let's not waste any time.
We are in this together, yes?
Lead, then. You have my steel.
You have someone already, friend.
Looks like you got someone already.
You have someone with you, already.
You already appear to have someone with you.
Looks like you've already got someone with you.
You already have someone to do your fighting for you. Don't need me.
Is this no longer so?
I performed the Black Sacrament, contacted you people, because I thought you guaranteed discretion.
It is a shame though.
Well, you can understand Elisif not wanting it.
I think our flutist here has gotten better since the Burning of King Olaf.
I'm so glad we got to have it. I thought for sure Elisif would never consent.
It's too bad the Burning of King Olaf was called off this year. I think some of the younger bards would really have gotten a kick out of it.
Keep a sharp eye out.
I wish Galmar would hurry it up. We shouldn't be here.
You must be the new unblooded. Welcome to the fight, sister.
You must be the new unblooded. Welcome to the fight, brother.
I hope we don't run into anything worse than Imperials in here.
I don't know what we're doing here. Ulfric must have his reasons.
Don't interfere with Imperial Legion business. Now move along, unless you want three inches of steel in your gut.
Late One-seventy-one.
Ummm, Morrowind suffered a massive explosion...
Remember, being a bard isn't just about the music.
Vvardenfell's Red Mountain erupts. Try to be precise, Jorn.
Illdi. What year did the Aldmeri Dominion invade the Empire?
Good, Illdi. Soak in the lore. Jorn, what happened during the Red Year?
Let me take a look...
It involves a recipe for a liquid known as Vaermina's Torpor.
Mara be praised! There is a way past the barrier to the inner sanctum.
Make sure that he is.
Make sure that she is.
Get the coat. Then we'll talk.
We should really get to court.
Good to meet a prospective Bard.
We should have the festival soon.
We should present the verse soon.
I wish you luck in finding the verse.
I thank you and the college thanks you, Jarl.
Ah, you have returned. How goes the task I gave you?
Nice to meet the person who went to King Olaf's Tomb.
I have faith that you'll return with King Olaf's Verse.
I still don't know if rewriting the verse is going to work.
Don't forget to speak to Jorn when you're ready for the festival.
Welcome to the Bards College. I am the headmaster here. How may I help you?
Be careful, you might find more than just King Olaf's Verse in Dead Man's Respite.
[QUOTE]He sacked Winterhold in dragon form, and bent their minds to blame Solitude.[QUOTE]
I do hope the court likes the verse. I think we've done an excellent job of recreating it.

[QUOTE]So ends the story of Olaf the liar, a thief and a scoundrel we of Solitude commit to the fire.[QUOTE]
I am, Jarl. I wish to present King Olaf's verse from the Poetic Edda. Recovered this very day from the Bards Tomb.
[QUOTE]In Solitude bards train for their service, they also gather each year and burn a King who deserves it.[QUOTE]
You have proven your point, Viarmo.  The festival is truly a celebration of Solitude and a condemnation of false kings.
[QUOTE]His men dressed up and then went out to fight, but they reversed Olaf's orders much to Winterhold's sorrow.[QUOTE]
Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be generously rewarded.
Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be moderately rewarded.
Thank you yet again. I will make sure our applicant, who was instrumental in... recovering the poem will be well rewarded.
Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be very generously rewarded.
Ah, you mentioned something that would convince us the festival should take place but I didn't expect King Olaf's lost verse. Please proceed.
Malacath protect you.
You need some armor, outlander?
I am wise woman to this stronghold.
We can trade in the morning, outlander.
Soon, I will be of age. The taste is bitter.
If you wish to trade, see me during daylight.
Our chief is strong. That is all that matters.
Shuftharz can forge you some armor, outlander.
You are speaking to Larak, chief of Mor Khazgur.
Larak is strong, but he has much to prove as chief.
Even good hammers warp metal if struck without care.
Poisons can kill your enemies faster than any blade.
How about an axe? Malacath smiles on the axe-wielder.
Mother tells me to shape metal with focus and strength.
My place is chief and my challenge is to lead my people.
I have poisons for your weapons, and cures for your ills.
I envy you, outlander. You can choose to leave if you wish.
Perhaps I'll join the Legion one day, as my father had done.
The forge is strong and so is our chief, Larak. I'm content.
My son, Olur, learns the forge well. His work brings me pride.
You should see my mother, Sharamph, if you need a cure or a poison.
I'm a strict follower of the old traditions. Honor, strength, deeds.
You should see my forge-wife, Shuftharz, if you need weapons or armor.
My mother, Sharamph, knows many remedies you may wish to take with you.
I work in the forge and the mines. Mother says it pleases her and our people.
Do not allow Ataxia to fester. A smart warrior keeps a potion to cure diseases at all times.
meanspirited laughter
Well, we'd better get back to our rounds.
Ah, good. I've been wondering how we were supposed to defend this place from a dragon.
Did you see those robes march in this morning? Who're they with? More of the Emissary's treaty enforcers?
No. They're high mages, just in from Alinor. I guess Herself is finally getting worried about all the dragon attacks.
If a dragon does show up, maybe we'll get lucky and it will eat the mages first. Might give us enough time to kill it.
Ha. I'd like to see those arrogant bastards taken down a notch. Always looking down their noses at us lowly footsloggers.
No, I don't think so.
Welcome to the Warrens.
No, no. Goodness, no!
At least, I don't think so. No, it's just... It's just something I'd prefer to keep to myself.
Nope, sorry. Nothing.
I've been looking for you. Got something I'm supposed to deliver - your hands only.
Nope. Not even close.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you. Let me open the gate and you can head into the city.
Not here. Downstairs.
What? Something you're still confused about?
Nothing... Nothing...
The glimmer of life is gone...
Now you're one of us.
Which means you get to tag along on a little trip with me.
Oh, and here. You're a Stormcloak now, you ought to look the part.
Oh? I hadn't noticed.
Bolar has been in a bad mood for weeks, now.
Since Galka was taken from us. She's been... sad, I guess.
She's just worried about you. We all are. We just want you to be happy. We want to make you happy.
Perhaps. Perhaps not.
I see you still have the run of the place, traitor.
The things you say are just an act to please mother.
At least I've chosen a side instead of acting like a spectator.
One day, you'll be forced to make a choice. And I hope it's the right one, brother.
I'm disappointed in you brother. You had it all. You had it all and your mouth cost you everything.
Come now brother, don't act all high and mighty. I know you could care less about the war one way or another.
Put your weapon away.
You. Weapon. Away. Now!
Watch it with that thing!
You break it, you buy it.
You. Weapon. Put it away. Now.
Please... don't break my wares!
Now, now... no need for weapons.
Put that thing away, or get out.
You planning on using that weapon?
I trust you'll put your weapon away?
You're disturbing my other customers.
Dear. You should put that weapon away.
Don't start swinging that thing in here.
Don't break anything with that weapon, okay?
Put that thing away before someone gets hurt!
Ooh, real tough, wagging your weapon around...
It's probably best if you put that weapon away.
Nice weapon you got there. Care to put it away?
It's time to put the weapon away now. Thank you.
Perhaps you'd care to put your weapon away? Hmm?
This one wonders why you brandish your weapon so?
Put that thing away. You're making people nervous.
Why the drawn weapon? Is it contemplating violence?
Break my stuff with that weapon, and I'll break you.
If you cause problems, I'll have to ask you to leave.
You want to fight? That why you have your weapon out?
If that weapon breaks anything, you will be buying it.
You're making my patrons nervous. Put the weapon away.
If it's not too much to ask, put the weapon away? Thanks.
You're not planning on using that weapon in here, I hope.
Come on. Put the weapon away. You're making people nervous.
Fine weapon, but you wouldn't mind putting it away, I'm sure.
Neat weapon. You're not going to hurt anybody, though. Right?
Look. You're making my customers nervous. Put the weapon away.
There a reason you're walking around with an unsheathed weapon?
You can bring weapons in, but you can't use 'em in here. Got it?
Ever see someone killed with their own weapon? Would you like to?
Don't start swinging that thing in here. You break it, you buy it.
That weapon breaks my wares, we're gonna have us a real problem...
You should probably put that away before you knock something over.
It is making patrons nervous. It needs to put the weapon away, now.
You won't be intimidating me into lower prices. Put that thing away.
Might want to put it away that weapon... unless you plan on using it.
I suggest you put away your weapon. Wouldn't want to cause a... scene.
If that weapon breaks anything of mine, I'll break something of yours.
You're not planning on hurting anyone with that weapon there, are you?
So... carrying that weapon around like that makes you feel safe, does it?
Wow. Nice weapon! Can I hold it? I promise not to break anything. Honest!
Brandishing your weapon is not going to help you negotiate a better sale...
Civilized people don't brandish their weapons unless they plan to use them.
Oh ho! What's with the weapon? Looks like it's about to get rough in here.
Unless you're here to sell that weapon of yours, why don't you put it away.
We've all seen your little weapon. We're impressed. Now, please put it away.
If you don't mind, my patrons would appreciate it if you put the weapon away.
You're making people a bit nervous. Should consider putting that weapon away.
Nice weapon you have there. But I don't suppose you'd consider putting it away?
You got no respect, strutting about with that weapon out, threatening everyone.
What's this? Is it spoiling for a fight? If not, it should hide its weapon away.
This is a proper store. Start acting like a proper customer. Sheathe that weapon.
If that weapon causes problems for my customers, I cause problems for you. Got it?
You got guts walking around with that weapon out. Looking for a fight? Is that it?
You'd better know how to use that weapon if you plan on swinging it around in here.
Damn fool parading around with your weapon out. You planning on hurting someone, huh?
Umm... you're not planning on using that weapon, are you? At least not on me... right?
Walk into the the wrong place with your weapon drawn? You might not walk out again....
I trust I won't have to, but I'll bust your head in if you cause problems for my patrons.
In some parts of the world, wielding a weapon openly like that is an invitation to combat...
Walking around with your weapon out is bound to make people nervous. We understand each other?
That's mighty bold, strutting about like that, looking for a fight. This one will oblige if he must.
While a good fight is always entertaining, my patrons don't like blood in their food. Put the weapon away.
Uh. Hey. That weapon there is just for show. Right? I mean, you aren't going to hurt me or anything... right?
Shoot the far target.
Shoot the left target.
Shoot the right target.
Shoot the middle target.
Aim for the middle target.
OK, let's see what you can do.
Now hit the target to the left.
Now it's time to use all three at once.
Great shot. Now hit the target to the right.
We've talked about composure, speed, and precision.
You did it! All four targets in ten seconds. Nice job.
You did it! All three targets in eight seconds. Nice job.
I'm warning you now, this challenge will be quite difficult.
My older brother took me out hunting a lot when I was little.
She always said composure was the key to a successful archer.
When I tell you to, try and hit all four targets in ten seconds.
Don't rush your shot. Crouch down, get comfortable, and take aim.
We've talked about speed and composure. Now we'll go over precision.
It may take you a couple of tries, but that's what practice is all about.
Just remember everything I've taught you and you should be able to complete it.
If you find yourself in such a situation, then you need to make your shot count.
When I tell you to, try and hit each of the three closest targets in eight seconds.
My father was rarely home, so it was my mother who actually taught me how to use a bow.
If you can remain calm, even in the midst of chaos, your arrow will most likely find its target.
Remember to stay within the boundaries and only use the practice arrows. I have some if you don't have any.
At the time, it was difficult to keep food on the table, let alone have enough left over to sell at the market.
So whenever we came across more than one deer in a single location, it was imperative we kill as many as we could.
Often times you won't be able to get as close to your prey as you'd like and you'll have to settle with a long shot.
However, with such a long shot, it's more than likely that's the only shot you'll be able to take before your prey runs off.
I'll count to three and then say [QUOTE]go.[QUOTE] You have ten seconds to hit each of the four targets. Draw string and get ready.
If you can learn to keep your composure and trust that each shot is true, then you should be able to quickly handle multiple targets.
I'll count to three and then say [QUOTE]go.[QUOTE] You have eight seconds to hit each of the three targets. Draw string and get ready.
OK, your turn. Try and hit that target way in the back, far behind the other three. Remember to take your time and make your shot count.
So endeth the lesson.
To Oblivion with you.
Forgive me, my brother.
Mara forgives you, my child.
Back from whence you came, heathen!
Rest well and sleep deeply, my brother.
Sorry, what was that?
Nothing Vulwulf.... cheers.
Vulwulf, it's always a pleasure.
When you're standing downwind of me.
Maven! So good to see you again. Hoist a flagon and celebrate with me!
Stendarr be with you.
The Vigil will be watching you.
None escape the Vigil. All come into the light.
Walk always in the light, or we will drag you to it.
The suffering the Daedra cause will not go unpunished.
The Mercy of Stendarr does not extend to Daedra worshippers.
Stendarr's Mercy be upon you, for the Vigil has none to spare.
Wherever the Daedra hide, the Vigil of Stendarr will cast them into the light.
You speak to a Vigilant of Stendarr. Cavort with any Daedra, and we will hunt you down.
I am Keeper of the Vigil here in Skyrim. We bring Stendarr's Mercy to the innocent and His Justice to the Daedra.
You're bloated with disease. The Vigilant of Stendarr can help you, as long as you promise to never assist the Daedra.
Surely you're joking?
Still... everyone assumes the Dark Brotherhood has been completely destroyed. They may be a bit more lax than usual.
This is the true Emperor, not some half-Septim lookalike. He'll be surrounded by elite bodyguards, I'm sure. You'll have your work cut out for you.
Talen! Another round!
I think you've had plenty, Vulwulf. Maybe you should head on home.
You stupid lizard! I said give me some more drink, or I'll have your head on a pike!
Talos guide you, lad.
Talos guide you, lass.
Thank you for asking.
Thank you for coming.
I've been looking for you.
Thank you, Harbinger.
Thank you, my friend.
That can be arranged.
Then pay with your blood.
Skyrim has no use for your kind.
Then suffer the Emperor's wrath.
Time to cleanse the Empire of its filth.
Then let me speed your passage to Sovngarde!
That may be the case.
But she is as volatile as a sabre cat. One wrong word, and I've seen her turn on a man so quickly...
That was a close one!
That's not fair, now.
Just... try and keep out of our way.
Haven't I always been a good father? A good chief?
Yatul and I do all the hunting. Mul and Gadba do all the mining. It seems like all you do is find more wives to get killed.
That's the way it is.
That's what they say.
Lust can make a man do the unthinkable.
The ashes were still warm when he pledged himself to Alva.
See, he's living with Alva now. That started the day after the fire.
They think he did it to get rid of his wife so he could be with Alva.
He moved in with her the day after the fire. Even I find that suspicious.
It ain't right, movin' in with a new love the day after your kin die like that.
The Dark Brotherhood?
Now... now you'll let me go. Right?
Now... now wait a minute. Let's not get hasty. I mean, surely my friend wouldn't want me to endanger my own life. Right?
Look, his name is Balagog gro-Nolob. He's an Orc! The Gourmet's an Orc! He's staying at the Nightgate Inn. That's all I know!
The ears of the wind?
I need a Daedra's heart, at once! Quickly, quickly!
This message is for me. I understand now. I have work to do. You, I shall need your help.
Malacath himself said this to you? But what does it... Ah! Yes! I see! A ritual is necessary!
There's a difference?
Now, now my dear. I'm talking about academia, not politics.
Esbern, if the Empire could even acknowledge the Blades existence, we'd all have reason to celebrate.
I've been writing some notes about all the Akaviri designs we've discovered. If only the Imperial Library could see my research.
To Whiterun with you.
Get those documents to Whiterun.
Wait, is that a tail?
Must be new around here.
Seems a bit short to me.
Haven't seen her around before.
Haven't seen him around before.
Come here. Let me see your face.
You there. I don't think I've seen you around before.
Well all right, then.
What brings you here?
What did you call me?
What has he done now?
I've never trusted him... what has he done?
Ah, Falion. Always looking where he shouldn't for things he doesn't need.
What is it this time?
Yes, yes. What is it?
This better be important.
Was there something else?
Can I help you with anything else?
Back, eh? And how was our friend Calcelmo?
Please, make it brief. We have much to do.
Please, there isn't much time. What is it?
Look, I'm very busy, so this better be important.
Ah yes, my matchmaker. What is it I can do for you?
We haven't much time for discussion, but what did you need?
Let's listen to Enthir's translation before we decide what we do.
Shhh. Listen to Enthir... we can't afford to miss a single detail.
I've already provided you with the key to my museum, what else could you possibly want?
What is your bidding?
No, I... I submit. No more.
Where'd you stash it?
Honest, I didn't take it!
I. I don't know, it wasn't me. I swear!
Look at me when I'm talking to you, eh?
Am I going have to beat it out of you? Is that what you want?
You start flapping that jaw of yours or I'll start flapping it for you. You understand me?
Why can't Froa do it?
Because I'm telling you to.
But papa was going to take me hunting tomorrow!
I'm going to need your help in the kitchen tomorrow.
Oh, I don't think you're old enough for that yet. You can help me salt the cheese curd.
Work in it? I own it.
You could say that. I own the place.
Yes, Dean. Thank you.
Your performance has been excellent lately Aia. You still need training but one day you will make an adequate singer.
You damn well better.
Therefore all that remains is to bestow it upon you.
Not so fast, there's a matter of residence to be discussed.
When the house is yours, return to me and I will present you the title.
You've already taken all the necessary steps in becoming eligible for the title.
A Thane of Riften is expected to maintain permanent residence within the city walls.
After the place is yours, come back to me and we'll deal with the rest of the nonsense.
And by the Eight, aren't you fortunate that my steward has just the place for you to buy.
In order to have the title bestowed upon you, you need to purchase a house within Riften.
Before I can present you with the title, there's but a single requirement you must fulfill.
My steward has such a home available to you for purchase. I think you'll find the accommodations to be most pleasing.
I've checked with my court and apparently you're fully eligible... there's nothing standing in the way of presenting you the title.
You have a job to do.
You want to get paid? Do what I hired you for.
You ready, auxiliary?
Looks like the damned rebels got here first. No matter, we have the element of surprise. Prepare to move out.
The Stormcloaks are here in force. Stick close and follow orders so we don't stir up the whole place against us.
You wanted to see me?
You forget yourself, young one.
I worry that you've been spending too many nights out.
That's why it's best to not mistake foolhardiness for bravery.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap. Just... these hunters. We're all on edge.
Where I go is my business. If you have a concern about my honor, bring it before the Circle.
You're short on coin.
That's the spirit! Let's go.
Come back when you have the coin.
This will be good training. Let's go!
Just fists. No weapons, no magic... no crying. Let's go!
Why don't you come back when you actually have a hundred gold?
I said a hundred gold! Damn broke elves and damn broke elf-lovers.
All right. Fists only. And none of that magic stuff, either. Let's go!
Just your own two hands. Weapons and magic are out. Now let's see what you got!
Hey, I may have had a few, but I can still count. You don't have a hundred septims on you.
...sweet Night Mother.
Whistling - no subtitles
I don't even know what to think anymore...
You will talk when you're ready, won't you? Won't you...
Oh, but I will speak. I will speak to you. For you are the one.
Are you excited? Oh, you should be. Things are finally looking up!
What? The Listener? What are you going on about? What is this lunacy?
You are the Listener! You are the Listener! I have served mother well, I have!
By Sithis, this ends now! Back away, fool! Whatever you've been planning is over!
Oh, but how can I defend you? How can I exert your will? If you will not speak? To anyone!
You must deliver those items to your superior. And I... I must get out of this foul place.
It's true, it's true! The Night Mother has spoken! The silence has been broken! The Listener has been chosen!
Poor Cicero. Dear Cicero. Such a humble servant. But he will never hear my voice. For he is not the Listener.
Are you all right? I heard the commotion. Who was Cicero talking to? Where's the accomplice? Reveal yourself, traitor!
Are we alone? Yes... yes... alone. Sweet solitude. No one will hear us, disturb us. Everything is going according to plan.
Poor Cicero has failed you. Poor Cicero is sorry, sweet mother. I've tried, so very hard. But I just can't find the Listener.
What? What treachery! Defiler! Debaser and defiler! You have violated the sanctity of the Night Mother's tomb! Explain yourself!
And what do you do? Nothing! Not... not that I'm angry! No, never! Cicero understands. Heh. Cicero always understands! And obeys!
What about you? Have you... have you spoken to anyone? No.... No, of course not. I do the talking, the stalking, the seeing and saying!
I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to her! To the Listener!
I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to him! To the Listener!
Tell Cicero the time has come. Tell him the words he has been waiting for, all these years: [QUOTE]Darkness rises when silence dies.[QUOTE]
Yes, you. You, who shares my iron tomb, who warms my ancient bones. I give you this task - journey to Volunruud. Speak with Amaund Motierre.
The others... I've spoken to them. And they're coming around, I know it. The wizard, Festus Krex... perhaps even the Argonian, and the un-child...
(yawn) I'm so tired...
Let me speak to our guest.
Don't be shy. You should be the one to carve.
This is your initiation into the coven. Go ahead. Have the first bite.
After you, Dragonborn.
Let's go see if Esbern's right about Alduin's Wall.
We can meet you there, or all travel together, your call.
Have you ever heard of a Shout that can knock a dragon out of the sky?
Have you ever heard of such a thing? A Shout that can knock a dragon out of the sky?
I know the area of the Reach that Esbern's talking about. Near what's now known as Karthspire, in the Karth River canyon.
Aggghh! Re...lease me!
Get these things off of me!
Please, oh please, I don't want to die...
Hello? Hello? Ah, I know you're listening.
What's happening? Damn it, what are you doing?
What did I do? Please, whatever it is, I'm sorry.
Cowards! Stealing a woman from her home! For shame!
Oh, gods, please! Let me live! I'll do anything you want!
By the gods, when I get out of here you're dead! You hear me? Dead!
Ah, sweet freedom. Now that's more like it. You have my thanks, stranger.
Thank you! Thank you! I won't tell anyone what happened here, I swear it!
Come now. Whatever the problem, we can talk about it like civilized folk. Hmm?
You'll let me go. I know you will. This is all just part of the game we play...
I... I can hear you talking out there. Please, let me go. I've done nothing to you.
I'm just a soldier. Killing is my job! Surely you can't fault a man for doing his job?
I don't know who you are, or what's going on here, but you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
I don't have time for this nonsense. I've got a home to keep and children to feed. Now let me out of here!
Whoever this is, clearly we got off on the wrong foot. Ah, but no worries. This is not the first time I have been bagged and dragged.
A man in my position makes lots of enemies. But what is a life-threatening situation if not an opportunity for mutual benefit? Hmmm?
Tell you what. You release me, and I promise my associates won't hunt you down like an animal and butcher you in the street. It's a win-win.
Is this about that raid last week? I told Holgrim there was no honor in killing sleeping men, but he wouldn't listen! It wasn't my fault, I swear!
An astute observation.
Skyrim is a beautiful and harsh mistress, but her people cling to such a petty notion of honor.
Any word on that fire?
Is Hroggar innocent or not?
She's dead. Laelette is dead.
Who's there? Is that you, father?
Now I'm going to have to kill you!
Have you found out anything about Alva?
Have you found proof of Alva's treachery?
I hear you put Laelette out of her misery.
Have you seen Laelette? Have you seen my wife?
I hear the steward asked you to look into the fire.
You better get proof of your accusations against Alva.
Mother's calling me. It's time for me to sleep now. I'm so tired. Thank you for making her feel better.
At the market, father.
Where've you been all day?
Humph. Some daughter you are.
Well, did you bring back any mead?
I barely make enough for us to eat as it is, father. You can't just drink it all away.
Aye, with a certainty.
Might even build a new temple and put Heimskr in charge of it. Hah! I bet he'd like that.
It was Talos that helped us win back the city. I'm as sure of that as the sun rising in the morning.
But ten little cuts...
Well, when you put it that way...
All I need is one to cut you in half.
Tiny blades don't hurt enough. A sword needs weight.
You might do well to learn a smaller weapon. Vary your style a bit.
But... I... very well.
Have what? What in blazes are you talking about?
Don't play stupid. I said turn out your pockets... now!
That's right. It isn't yours. You're under arrest, Brand-Shei.
All right, Brand-Shei. Turn out your pockets, we know you have it.
I'm telling you, I don't... wait, what's this ring? This isn't mine!
This is insane! I didn't steal anything! I never saw this ring before in my entire life!
We can do this one of two ways. You can walk with me up to the keep, or I can drag your lifeless body. Your choice.
But... What of Yamarz?
I see. He did not survive. He... He died well?
By all means, show me.
Can you? You have the power of the Voice? Now I'm interested.
Can I get you a drink?
Looking for something?
Anything I can get you?
Can I get you something?
Stay out of my way, boot.
What do you need, stranger?
Welcome to Dead Man's Drink.
Yes? What is it that you want?
You have the look of a killer.
I'm sorry, I should really go now.
No time, I have business to conduct.
Arkay helps us find peace with death.
Enemies and ears. Both are everywhere.
Being Housecarl of Falkreath is an honor.
I protect the Jarl, whoever that might be.
Shor's bones! A handsome man in Falkreath.
Stand aside.  I don't need to speak to you.
My husband Mathias and I tend Corpselight Farm.
Only a hearty soul travels the road these days.
I can't really help you, I'm just Dengeir's maid.
That Valga Vinicia is a gossip and a troublemaker.
Strangers like you bring war. I've seen enough war.
A strong drink will chase off that chill in the air.
Don't mind Bolund. He's young and gets riled easily.
Stendarr protect Falkreath until Skyrim's Sons rise.
The number of graves in this cemetery never decreases.
These graves hold the sons and daughters of Falkreath.
Falkreath's warriors always return, one way or another.
In Falkreath if I don't know it, it's not worth knowing.
Indara and I like to keep to ourselves and run our farm.
Treat the Jarl with respect, and you'll be welcome here.
I can't believe we let provincials like you wander Skyrim.
Show respect while you're here and you and I will be fine.
Falkreath's cemetery reminds of us that war is not new here.
The Stormcloaks want freedom but don't understand its price.
For Falkreath and I this is just one more war in a long line.
Can't believe we let provincials like you wander around Skyrim.
Dengeir was a good Jarl in his day.  Even if his day has passed.
My nephew has always been handed things, even the title of Jarl.
There are opportunities everywhere.  Why don't you go find them.
Runil has been a true friend to my wife and I in our time of need.
Falkreath is a hard place and tending a farm here is thankless work.
The war has changed Falkreath, even our neighbors can be our enemies.
You'll find my brother Solaf and I are the only true Nords in Falkreath.
From maid to Steward, I can hardly believe it. I hope I'm up to the task.
Skyrim's history of war is well documented here in Falkreath's graveyard.
Someone new, perhaps someone looking for me to mix something up for them?
Be mindful.  My maid Tekla has been known to pass information to Siddgeir.
Dengeir deserves more respect than his nephew, Jarl Siddgeir, affords him.
A hearty welcome to Falkreath!  All of Skyrim's true sons are welcome here!
Siddgeir can sometimes act too quickly but he does listen to Helvard and I.
How could people see all the graves in Falkreath and still want to make war?
My brother Dengeir can be... difficult. Take his words with a grain of salt.
I don't know if the war is Arkay's will or man's, but it's none of my doings.
I escaped fighting in Cyrodiil only to have it track me down again in Skyrim.
I wouldn't complain if we could string together a few sunny days now and then.
Try not to judge Falkreath too harshly, visitor - the war has been hard on us.
Boland speaks much about the war and the Stormcloaks but he knows who provides.
I'm the Steward here.  I serve under Jarl Siddgeir and Jarl Dengeir before him.
You're going to have the men around here wrapped around your finger in no time.
War is not new to Falkreath. You have only to stand in our cemetery to see that.
Nenya's history of service is impeccable.  She truly is the Steward of Falkreath.
Kust is responsible for the cemetery here in Falkreath, I take care of the Shrine.
If you're sympathetic to the Empire, you'll be wise to put Falkreath far behind you.
Unless you intend to bury someone this isn't the place you're looking for, traveler.
Steel's good, but loyalty's better. I'm loyal to Dengeir first and the Empire second.
Unless you intend to bury someone, this isn't the place you're looking for, traveler.
If either these Nords or Imperials had some red in their blood this war would be over.
The war bleeds Skyrim. It bleeds her dry and I think none of us are the better for it.
Men and women join the war, they travel far on these roads to spill each other's blood.
Falkreath was once full of wanderers and warriors like yourself. Those were better days.
Mathies is a kind and wise man. The Nords could use more like him. So could the Imperials.
Without birth there is no life, without death there is only stasis. Such is the truth of Arkay.
My wife, Indara, has a gift with animals.  It makes her a better farmer than anyone I've ever seen.
Well met. Unlike my brother, I've no dislike of strangers. Met lots of 'em while I was a Stormcloak.
Be mindful. My maid Tekla has been known to pass information to that pompous nephew of mine, Siddgeir.
Not much exciting happens around here. You're as like as not to be bored to death if you stay too long.
Don't let the shop's name frighten you away. I have plenty of reliable tonics and healing potions to sell.
I've half a mind to ask if you'll take me on one of your adventures, but I can't just leave Valga on her own.
This war isn't needed. Imperials like my wife can be hard to handle but we Nords could work with them. I should know.
I was Jarl once, but I was encouraged to step down when I took sides with the Stormcloaks. It was an imperial plot, I tell you!
Did you take the head?
Elder Scrolls. Indeed.
I know of one. Forgotten. Sequestered.
But I cannot go to it, not poor Septimus, for I... I have arisen beyond its grasp.
The Empire. They absconded with them. Or so they think. The ones they saw. The ones they thought they saw.
Excellent work, child.
Ah, the blood of deceit is a nourishing flow.
At last, my blade is returned to its full glory.
Their tears shine the ebony to a sharpest gleam.
I can feel their heartbreak swelling in my blade.
Now go forth, child. Continue your tiny subversions against the orders of trust and intimacy.
Finally. Now get lost.
Oh, thank you! Divines bless your kind heart.
Fine, leave me to die.
Glory to the Forsworn!
The Reach will be ours again.
We'll have our freedom. One day.
Ah, my friend from Cidhna Mine. Hello.
This is where it will begin. A new uprising.
The Silver-Bloods pay their debts. You have my thanks.
My brother tells me you've done us a service. Thank you.
I saw you. With the Forsworn. By the old gods, that was something.
Can't believe anyone was dumb enough to mistake you for a Forsworn agent.
Forsworn rampaging through the streets. As if business wasn't slow enough.
I heard about you being pardoned. What were the guards thinking, taking you in?
Damn those Forsworn. Think they can kill people in my city? I'll have Madanach's head!
I'll be damned. Someone who actually escaped Cidhna Mine. You're the talk of the Warrens.
You escaped Cidhna Mine? With Madanach? Everyone in the Warrens has been praising your name.
Huh. Heard you broke out of Cidhna Mine with those Forsworn. Do you have any idea how many died?
By killing Madanach you've freed Markarth from his hidden tyranny. On behalf of the city, I thank you.
Oh, it's you! Sorry to hear about your imprisonment. I'm sure the guards didn't mean to throw you in jail
What was it like? Cidhna Mine? We've all been talking about your escape. And being pardoned after. Amazing.
You. You aren't with the Forsworn, are you? People say they saw you when the prisoners escaped. So many dead.
Can't believe Madanach is on the loose again. I hope those rumors I'm hearing about your part in that are wrong.
Everyone's been talking about you. The guards will have to answer for throwing an innocent person in Cidhna Mine.
Madanach has been found to be the true murderer of Markarth. On behalf the city, I apologize for your wrongful imprisonment.
Go, leave me in peace.
Keep following, it isn't far.
It's just this way. Keep following me.
So tell me, did Aringoth enjoy your visit?
All eyes are on you, lad. Don't disappoint us.
All eyes are on you, lass. Don't disappoint us.
Let's wait until Brynjolf's here before we begin.
Let me show you the operation, then you can ask your questions.
I suggest you listen to what Mercer has to say... if you want in.
Good luck, Dragonborn.
Ha! I thought as much.
So I'm, uh... writing a song for you...
A ballad? Oh, now I know you're joking with me.
Well, that's where I started. But it turned into something of a ballad.
It's all true, I swear it. You can hear it when it's done. I'll just need a year or two smooth the rough edges.
Why Jon Battle-Born. You're writing me a song? Does it somehow involve blood, or beheadings, or the honor of my forebears?
Here, this is for you.
Oh right, the rum. Thank you. I developed a taste for it after a fair weather trip to Hammerfell.
Hevnoraak is defeated.
Did you find all of the vessels?
Kill him now, while we still can!
Do not interrupt the ritual. Go empty the vessels and sit on the throne.
With those three vessels, Hevnoraak can restore himself. Find them before he can.
Hmm? What do you want?
Have anything interesting to tell me?
Let me know if I can get you anything.
These damn bears are driving me crazy!
You a pilgrim or just passing through?
I hope life's treating you well, friend.
Need a room? Maybe a drink? You name it.
If you fancy a bit of music, let me know.
You better not be here to stir up any trouble.
Can you believe it? Another pile of logs ruined.
I hope Fastred's doing well in Riften. I miss her.
Such a fine day, smell the air! Isn't it wonderful?
Ah, good to see you again! How did that delivery go?
I'm going to put those pelts you gave me to good use.
Anything I can help you with? A drink or a room perhaps?
Is it absolutely necessary for you to bother me right now?
Pardon me, milady. Would you care to hear me play my lute?
Pardon me, milord. Would you care to hear me play my lute?
Hello, my friend? What can I do for you on such a fine day?
Oh Reyda! Redya! You live among the clouds now, dear Reyda!
Any idea how I can get my daughter's head out of the clouds?
So, have you shown those furry menaces that I mean business?
Thanks again for delivering those supplies to the Greybeards.
You don't look like a pilgrim. Why bother visiting Ivarstead?
Watch yourself on High Hrothgar, I hear wolves prowl the steps.
My daughter's driving me crazy, so forgive me if I'm a bit on edge.
Narfi's sad now. Still wait for Reyda. No more sleep. No, no... no.
I can't believe Fastred ran off to Riften with that... that bastard.
I can't believe Fastred's gone. I... I should have been nicer to her.
If you ever settle down to have children, think twice before you do it.
I miss Reyda. She was so nice to Narfi. Narfi's sad he can't be with Reyda.
7,000 Steps indeed... next time they need to build it closer to the ground...
I swear, if one more thing goes wrong, I'm going to burn my mill to the ground!
I wish I could make my deliveries more often, but the road's getting dangerous.
Narfi's happy now. Maybe Narfi can sleep. Sleep all night. Sleep, sleep, sleep.
Pilgrim or not, if I were you, I'd move right through our backwards little town.
Those bears are making Miss Temba so angry. I hope you can do something about them.
If I were you, I'd keep away from the barrow on the east side of town... it's haunted.
Passing through on your way to High Hrothgar? About to make a delivery up there myself.
We don't get many visitors through here, unless their headed up to High Hrothgar of course.
I can't imagine how exciting it must be like to journey from place to place. You're so lucky!
Oh! You're a traveler! You must have so much to tell about the world outside this boring town!
You must be another pilgrim on the way up to High Hrothgar. No other reason to pass through here.
I can't see you, Reyda! I can't find you! Why are you hiding? Hiding, hide, hide, hide! Don't make me sad!
Miss Temba is much happier now that you took care of those bears. She may not look like she is, but I can tell.
And to think that we've been supplying the Greybeards with our own food supplies. What have they ever done for us?
Now that our [QUOTE]ghost[QUOTE] has been unmasked, I hope we see more visitors in town than just the occasional pilgrim.
This has to be the worst place in Skyrim to run a mill. How am I supposed to do anything with all those bears running around?
Horker skin, actually.
Grelka, can you repair boots?
Leather? If they're armored, you should talk to Balimund over at The Scorched Hammer.
Why in goodness name would you have... oh never mind, just bring them by my house later and I'll see what I can do.
How deep is this cave?
Don't get too far ahead.
It's kind of dark in here.
Ugh, this place... horrible.
Ugh, Draugr. They reek of decay.
Bandits... the worst type of scum.
Wizards. Why is it always wizards.
I almost died in a ruin just like this.
Wonder what they mine from these walls.
Danger's about, I can tell. Be cautious.
I thought I heard footsteps. Be careful.
I wonder what they were mining down here.
What do you think these devices were for?
Do try not to set off any traps, will you?
Do you think Tiber Septim ever fought here?
Mzinchaleft. I swore I'd never return here.
Do you think we'll find gold nuggets in here?
I wonder what great battles were fought here?
It seems warmer down here than it was outside.
I'm certain we'll find some treasure down here.
Caves sounded more exciting in the bard's songs.
Ugh... dark sorcery. Always makes my skin crawl.
I'll take a sword or mace over a pick axe any day.
It feels good to walk the streets of Riften again.
I don't like the looks of this place... not at all.
The cloying air in this place is almost unbearable.
These poor souls... suffering in eternal servitude.
You know what I miss the most right now? Fresh air.
Curse this chill! I should have dressed more warmly.
I wonder what the ancient nords used this place for?
I've ventured into quite a few Nord ruins in my day.
It feels like a whole mountain of rock is above  us.
These ruins are old, maybe a thousand years or more.
Wouldn't it be something if we found a vein of gold?
I could have sworn I heard something right behind us.
These caves... they harbor ill omens, I can sense it.
There may be no enemy more foul than a walking corpse.
Trust in Mara... she'll protect us in this dark place.
Wonder if any of my ancestors ever walked these halls?
The sooner we can get out of this filth-pit, the better.
I'm already looking forward to getting back above ground.
Many have fallen in this crypt. The Draugr show no mercy.
Keep your eyes open, I don't like the looks of this place.
These Forsworn don't even have the decency to dress right.
Why anything would chose to reside down here is beyond me.
My nose and mouth are so full of dust, I can hardly breath.
Exploring these caves feels like coming home. I missed this.
I served as a healer in a fort not unlike this one long ago.
If fought more than my share of bandits in places like this.
It's wonderful to be able to sleep soundly, don't you think?
Mind your step. I think I spied a patch of ice on the floor.
Most bandits are cowards. These seem to be braver than most.
There are strange echoes in these caves. Keep you eyes open.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather explore, say, a nice tavern?
Careful. Our footsteps will echo in every chamber and tunnel.
I hope that when I die, I don't end up as a shambling corpse.
What some call devotion to the dark arts, I call foolishness.
I don't like wizards and their spells. Give me an axe any day.
The fewer of these mines we venture into, the happier I'll be.
The thought of the dead rising... makes me sick to my stomach.
There could be Draugr about, I can smell the decay in the air.
You can't argue with these mages. They'll attack you on sight.
What is that stench? Rotting wood, perhaps? That can't be good.
Draugr are slow and clumsy. Hardly a challenge for a man like me.
Hard to believe people actually have to work in places like this.
Watch yourself, these Nordic ruins are notorious for their traps.
Did you bring a torch? These old forts can get pretty dark inside.
I feel the eyes of angry spirits upon us. We are not welcome here.
I've never been inside a dwarven ruin. They are simply astounding.
I've seen my share of black magic, but that's all in the past now.
Just look at this place. Is this what passes for a fort in Skyrim?
Windhelm is absolutely freezing. How can these people tolerate it?
By the Nine, I'd pay good money for a pint of ale to warm my bones!
These wizards are mad beyond reason. They understand only violence.
I hate bandits and thieves. Men like these raid our town every year.
Be wary for traps. If you spy one, try to get an enemy to trigger it.
I suppose you intend to carry off every item of value in these ruins.
It isn't just your blood that a vampire wants, it's your mortal soul.
You can easily break a blade on the metal skin of a Dwemer construct.
By the gods, let this mine be small so we can be done with it quickly.
I suppose the warmth in this place comes from all the hot steam vents.
Take extra care you don't hit your head on a low-hanging bit of stone.
These walking devices are strange yet amazing. What magic powers them?
This is the first time I've set foot in Windhelm. What a dreary place.
Vampires... an unclean lot. It will be a pleasure to clear this place.
Bandits know nothing of pity or mercy. No need to show them any either.
Gods willing, we'll find a chest full of gold in one of these chambers.
Fighting draugr is as much about controlling your fear as anything else.
What a marvel of engineering. The ancient Nords were ingenious builders.
What good is a sword or an axe against an enemy made of brass and steel?
Are you sure you can find your way? It would be easy to get lost in here.
I wonder how many poor souls have lost their lives working these tunnels.
So many shadowy corners to strike from! I could learn to like this place.
This place is amazing! It's hard to believe that mortal hands built them.
Being a priest of Vaermina put me very close to dark sorcery at its worst.
Did you hear that? A metal on stone sound... hmmm, perhaps it was nothing.
If it wasn't for all the dangers in here, this place could almost be cozy.
If these ruins frighten you, take comfort in the knowledge that I am here.
Keep your eyes open for ambushes. These forts have too many blind corners.
Killed my first creature in a cave just like this... I'll never forget it.
When I was a child, I dreamed about having a fort like this all to myself.
As we walk these stone passages, we delve into the very bones of the earth.
If a man can't feel at home in a freezing cave, then he isn't truly a Nord.
It probably took some Dwemer craftsman a year to build one of those things.
Silence will serve us well in this place. Let us take our foes by surprise.
You'd have to be pretty desperate to want to make a home in this dank hole.
It would be easy for someone -- or something -- to sneak up on us down here.
It's strange to think that some of my own ancestors might be buried in here.
Bandits are desperate men. They have nothing to lose, and they fight like it.
Never knew a place could be so ancient. I bet it's over a thousand years old.
These earthen passages do not agree with me. I already miss the wind and sky.
Would it be foolish to stop for a while and light a fire? I suppose it would.
I'd rather fight bandits than draugr. At least bandits know when to stay dead.
It's amazing this place is so well preserved. There isn't even a hint of rust.
Not for all the gold in Skyrim would I spend my life working in these tunnels.
Watch out for the hot steam vents down here. They'll burn you worse than fire.
Whiterun is a such beautiful city. Have you ever seen the likes of this place?
It is remarkable that so many of these ancient Dwemer creations still function.
It is strange to think that these chambers were once home to the ancient Nords.
These ruins and their mechanical inhabitants are all that remain of the Dwemer.
This cold is unbearable. It's all I can do not to shiver until my teeth rattle.
Bandits are the worst lot. They'd steal from their own mothers given the chance.
If this cold numbs my fingers any worse, I'll scarcely be able to hold a weapon.
Keep your eyes open for traps. Old ruins like this are usually filled with them.
The Forsworn are as wild as wolves. Practice those old magics, so some folk say.
At times like this, I truly appreciate the joys of a warm fire and a stiff drink.
How pathetic, being forced to eke out a miserable existence in a place like this.
I do not envy those creatures that make a home in such cold, dark places as this.
There is an unnatural chill in the air. Some evil power is at work in this place.
These ruins might be interesting if I wasn't already an expert on Nordic history.
Can you just imagine how ancient this place must be? Hundreds of years? Thousands?
I wonder what the ancient Nords did in these ruins. Unspeakable sacrifices, maybe?
Let's try not to make too much noise. I've heard that cave-ins can start that way.
Perhaps we can find some treasure if we search the grounds of the fort thoroughly.
Be aware of rune traps on the ground or else this could be a very short expedition.
I wonder what keeps these machines working so long after their masters disappeared.
This smell of dank earth and worm-eaten wood is going to make me lose my last meal.
Don't go stopping for a nap. If you fall asleep in this place, you'll never wake up.
Watch the walls for the sphere constructs... they can appear in the blink of an eye.
I hope there's more bandits around... their numbers could use a little more thinning.
I'll bet some of these artifacts would fetch a good price. I hope they're not cursed.
I've half a mind to grab a pickaxe and start digging. Never know what you might find.
I've heard that miners sometimes die from poisonous gases trapped beneath the ground.
These timber supports are rotted through. It's a wonder this place is still standing.
Do these steel walls and strange Dwemer devices make you uneasy? Perhaps it's just me.
I thought about becoming a bandit. I decided I preferred clean clothes and fresh mead.
Do not ask me to take treasures from this place. I will not risk the anger of the dead.
Taken alone, the draugr aren't so fearsome. They're far more deadly in greater numbers.
Vampires are utter abominations. We need to do everything in our power to destroy them.
Her Benevolence has taught me patience and mercy, but these vampires deserve none of it.
There is no adversary more deadly than a vampire. They are as cruel as they are cunning.
I can see the battle-lust in your eyes. Doom will surely come to any who cross your path.
I've half a mind to dismantle one of these Dwemer machines. I'd like to see how it works.
In a mine, the poor man labors to find precious stones that only the rich man can afford.
The Forsworn are strange men. They fight to reclaim Markarth, but they live like savages.
The Jarls never want to pay to keep the forts. They just keep slipping further into ruin.
There's an old maid's tale that says our ancestors dug these mines with their bare hands.
Don't let the vampires strike you or else you may get infected with their blood poisoning.
The ancient Nords were a savage people, but they built some remarkable crypts and temples.
This place must be cleansed. These draugr were once living beings and they deserve better.
I don't know what persuaded you to assist me when we met in Dawnstar, but I'm glad you did.
Incredible... imagine the manpower and ingenuity needed to carve the buildings of Markarth.
These bandits would stab each other in the back if it meant an extra coin in their pockets.
Had they placed their faith in magic instead of machinery, the Dwemer might still be around.
I can see why they built the fort here. A small force could control most of the nearby land.
What an amazing city. I've actually never managed to visit Whiterun, but I always wanted to.
I should bring some of these Dwemer artifacts to the Arcane University in Cyrodiil for study.
Outlaws and brigands are the lowest of the low. They prey on their own countrymen for profit.
Plunder these ruins at your peril, friend. The spirits of the dead won't look kindly upon it.
The stories don't say why the dwarves disappeared. I wonder if their machines turned on them.
It's unnatural, building all these machines. If you ask me, the Dwemer got what they deserved.
Just look at this place. I've seen better workmanship from Nord children only ten winters old.
Let's hope the miners didn't unearth anything besides precious stones, if you take my meaning.
They say ruins like these are filled with treasure. Of course, they're filled with traps, too.
Few would dare to trespass in these ruins. What you lack in wisdom, you make up for in courage.
I have to admit, I admire your courage. Most folk in Skyrim wouldn't go near a place like this.
Remember to check behind you every once in a while. Who knows what might try to sneak up on us.
We should bow our heads in silent reverence for those who are interred in Falkreath's cemetery.
There are forts like this all over Skyrim. The Imperials abandoned most of them a long time ago.
This place could be massive... very easy to get lost. We have to be careful not to lose our way.
I wonder why the Dwemer came to Skyrim. Why did they build this place? I suppose we'll never know.
It's said that the Forsworn make dark pacts with the Hagravens, and that is why they can use magic.
Gods, I'd hate to lose my footing in a place like this. A fall on this stony floor will break bones.
There's a lot of history in a place like that. I'll bet these walls could tell some amazing stories.
Ah, Winterhold. I've always wanted to visit this place. The secrets locked inside must be astounding.
Let's try and stay together, the sorcerers in these places tend to... well, harvest bodies for parts.
I've never been a sellsword... never traded my skills for pay. I've always adventured on my own terms.
Kill these casters as fast as you can, otherwise they may summon creatures we don't want to deal with.
When I was a boy, my friends and I used to play [QUOTE]seek the wumpus[QUOTE] in caves much like this.
Among other things, the Dwemer were expert trap-makers. Watch the floor for tripwires and false plates.
I've never admitted this before, but I've killed more than I care to admit. I'll just leave it at that.
We're bound to find some gold in these ruins, but out of respect, let's leave a few coins for the dead.
Everything in here seems to be about death. Burial urns, crypts, funeral shrouds. It's a bit depressing.
The College of Winterhold is an amazing sight. I've never set foot on the grounds, but always wanted to.
These Forsworn are just savages. They live in caves and ruins when civilized folk build towns and cities.
I would find the Dwemers' mechanical guardians fascinating if they didn't try to kill everything on sight.
Check every crate, chest and barrel you see. Who knows, maybe a few of them have something valuable inside.
I don't like fighting these Dwemer creations. Where's the fun in killing something that doesn't even bleed?
I've seen enough death to last three lifetimes, yet I never tire of a good fight. What do you make of that?
If there's one thing I'm certain of, it's that draugr burn like tinder. We could use that to our advantage.
There are those who believe that the entire Dwemer race will one day return just as suddenly as it vanished.
So this is what passes for Imperial craftsmanship. Try not to sneeze, or you might bring the whole fort down.
When the weather permitted, Aerin and I would often walk the Rift's forests. The trees here are so beautiful.
Look at this craftsmanship! These old halls fill some folk with dread, but as a Nord, they fill me with pride.
My mother was a strong woman... she's the one who instructed me on my swordfighting techniques. Can you imagine?
The Forsworn haven't been kind to Karthwasten. I've heard rumors that they've attacked this place without mercy.
There is no greater madness than those who seek to become vampires. That's a dark bargain if there ever was one.
I've heard Riften's home to the worst Skyrim has to offer. I hope we don't run into any trouble while we're here.
I've really missed traveling like this. Walking the breadth of Skyrim has always filled my heart with excitement.
The dwarves were masters at subterranean construction... these ruins show  only a fraction of their capabilities.
It takes uncommon strength to work the mines in Skyrim. The earth here is cold and hard, like the heart of a Nord.
A living Dwemer was once discovered in Morrowind. Can you imagine it, being the last surviving member of your race?
There are scholars in Cyrodiil who have dedicated their lives to solving the mystery of the Dwemers' disappearance.
These are the most dangerous, but the most profitable types of ruins. The dwarves must have been a prosperous race.
Watch your step, Markarth has quite a reputation thanks to the Silver-Blood family. I wouldn't advise crossing them.
I've heard that you can sell Dwemer artifacts on the black market down in Cyrodiil. They fetch a handsome price, too.
The Dwemer created so many wondrous machines, and yet nobody ever followed in their footsteps. Why is that, I wonder?
I remember a cutpurse trying to rob me on the road once. When I drew Grimsever, I think the poor man soiled his armor!
When I was a young acolyte of Vaermina, I paid my dues in a shrine located within the catacombs of a fort in Cyrodiil.
It was a bit difficult to come to the ways of Mara at first, but my fellow priests were kind and quite patient with me.
Scholars say the Dwemer were an advanced culture. Ha! The Nords outlasted their entire race. So much for being advanced.
The Dwemer who built this place were sometimes called Dwarves, but history records that they were no shorter than humans.
I've been to Ivarstead a few times, but never climbed High Hrothgar. I wouldn't mind visiting the monastery at the summit.
A good friend of mine was infected by a vampire long ago. He killed himself rather than change into one of those... things.
Finding Mara was the greatest moment of my life. I'll never forget the warmth that spread through my heart when we embraced.
I can't imagine what happened to the dwarves. How could a race with the capability to build a place like this simply vanish?
I grew up in The Pale. This land was my home for most of my life... and for a Dunmer, that's quite a statement, I assure you.
My mother always loved the sea. When I was young, we'd visit Solitude and watch the ships from the bluff. Ah... better times.
A group of bandits descended on Dawnstar once... if it wasn't for the guard, who knows what they could have done to the place.
When I was young, I'd journey with my father on hunting expeditions into Morrowind. The cliff racers made for excellent sport.
If my ma could see me now, she'd scold me good. She'd tell me I should know better than to go poking around in abandoned forts.
After running from Nightcaller Temple, I wandered Skyrim for years until I was taken in by a priest of Mara who lived in Morthal.
I've always wanted to make a pilgrimage here to the Temple of Mara. Thank you for bringing me here... you've made me quite happy.
I wonder if we'll come across some bandits who've just finished roasting a rabbit on a spit. Maybe they'll have a keg of ale, too.
I was recruited as an acolyte of Vaermina as a young elf. I had no real childhood to speak of... we weren't permitted to socialize.
My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps as a hunter, but I set my aspirations a bit higher. He never complained... I miss him.
The Greybeards are an amazing lot. Imagine, living your entire life without speaking to a friend or a loved one. I couldn't stand it.
I've done a lot of... questionable things in my life. Serving Vaermina was a horrible mistake, and I hope Mara will forgive me one day.
When I was a child, my village was burned to the ground by bandits. Do you know I actually saw one laugh as he ran my brother through...
I love the cold air... it's exhilarating. Perhaps it's because of my Nord blood, but there's something about it that makes me feel alive.
I've always felt a great deal of guilt running from Nightcaller Temple and leaving my friends to die. I'll never forgive myself for that.
People say Skyrim is one of the most dangerous places in Tamriel. I think they're wrong... it's magnificent and I'm proud to call it home.
I've been enjoying this journey with you. Not for the wealth we've accumulated, but just being carry Mara's will to every corner of Skyrim.
You should have seen me at the height of my adventuring career... I was fearless and took too many risks. But that's what it was all about.
I was a student at the Bards College for a short time... until my affiliation with Vaermina was discovered. I haven't been back to Solitude since.
My parents are long dead, but they lived wonderful lives... I have no sad stories to tell about them. Perhaps one day I'll visit their resting place.
How do you know of me?
I haven't heard that name in a long time.
How's the forge today?
Flattery doesn't suit you, Thongvor.
It's fine. Much better than the rickety tools I had in the Legion.
I was about to say how impressed I was that you always managed to put it back together.
Remember that old rusty sword I had? Damn thing must have had over a hundred chips in it.
Well, if you had learned to swing it correctly. A sword is an extension of the arm, not a meat cleaver.
Huh? What do you want?
Any luck with Sapphire?
Yeah? What's your problem?
Hey, I cut you into the deal. There's nothing else to discuss.
Look, I already said Shadr doesn't owe me a thing, so get off my back.
I do. Now and forever.
Ah, here's the proud groom now. Let's begin the ceremony.
Ah, here's the blushing bride now. Let's begin the ceremony.
It was Mara that first gave birth to all of creation and pledged to watch over us as her children.
May they journey forth together in this life and the next, in prosperity and poverty, and in joy and hardship.
We gather here today, under Mara's loving gaze, to bear witness to the union of two souls in eternal companionship.
It is from her love of us that we first learned to love one another. It is from this love that we learn that a life lived alone is no life at all.
I feel better already.
Gods bless you, healer.
Thank you. The pain is already easing.
I have a favor to ask.
I think they like you.
I'll meet you outside!
I'll never forget you.
That bastard got exactly what he deserved.
Thank you. That bastard got exactly what he deserved.
Here's the payment for killing Alain. And nothing for letting Nilsine live. Just remember, that was your decision.
But last I heard, Nilsine is still alive. So I guess you decided not to kill her as well. I have to admit... I'm disappointed.
And... I heard about Nilsine. You have more than fulfilled your part of the bargain. Please, take this - as payment, and a symbol of my affection.
I'm headed to the inn.
It's tradition. We mark the animal as a way to let the giants know we're giving it to them willingly. Sort of a peace offering.
It just feels so slow.
Of course not. My mistake.
I've never held a knitting needle.
After that, the shortsword will feel like a knitting needle when you pick it up again.
It will feel that way for a while. But eventually you'll get used to it, and then you'll get faster with it.
Just give me a moment.
The Star is being used to sustain Malyn's soul. I can't fix it while that fragment of him is inside.
Just you wait and see.
Why do the Nords bother you so much, Ambarys?
Oh, I doubt that very much. Who would load their ships, then?
Why do you even need to ask? They treat your people as bad as they do mine.
I think that's just their way. The Nords don't like anybody who's not a Nord, but they're not bad people, deep down.
Look around you. Don't you know what their little war is about? They want all non-Nords out of Skyrim. That means you and me.
Keeping busy, Sergius?
At least it's more money for the College.
Perhaps, but it just means more work for me.
As always. The Nords don't ever stop wanting things enchanted.
Like I said. Hagraven.
She only lets us out in the yard once. In the morning. And she just stands there watching us.
Miss Grelod is... well she's a terrible old crone. No person could be that cruel. I think she's part hagraven.
Lookin' forward to it.
So we'll be needing fresh horses, then?
Ha! Four more geldings sold. Sound like good news to you?
Why thank you for that most colorful assessment, Skulvar.
Everyone is this city is so on edge. I could use some good news, Skulvar.
Excellent. I'll send the proper letters, then, and have some fresh horses delivered straightaway.
I do hate to admit it, but if nothing else, all the fighting lately has been a complete blessing to this business.
Aye, mum. That we will. Mares, stallions, donkeys - I don't think it matters. Pretty sure I can sell any steeds we get.
Aye, that it has. Trust me, mum - once you've killed a man from a horse, you'll never want to fight on the ground again. Ain't no goin' back.
M'aiq is done talking.
M'aiq wishes you well.
M'aiq knows many things, no?
M'aiq is tired now. Go bother somebody else.
Werebears? Where? Bears? Men that are bears?
M'aiq has heard it is dangerous to be your friend.
M'aiq is very practical. He has no need for mysticism.
M'aiq saw a mudcrab the other day. Horrible creatures.
M'aiq hears many stories of war... yet few of them are true.
Skyrim was once the land of many butterflies. Now, not so much.
M'aiq does not remember his childhood. Perhaps he never had one.
Much snow in Skyrim. Enough snow. M'aiq does not want any more.
Something strange happens to Khajiit when they arrive in Skyrim.
Nords' armor has lots of fur. This sometimes makes M'aiq nervous.
M'aiq once walked to High Hrothgar. So many steps, he lost count.
Dragons were never gone. They were just invisible and very, very quiet.
What does this mean, to combine magic? Magic plus magic is still magic.
M'aiq knows much, and tells some. M'aiq knows many things others do not.
Snow falls. Why worry where it goes? M'aiq thinks the snowflakes are pretty.
M'aiq is always in search of calipers, yet finds none. Where could they have gone?
M'aiq loves the people of Skyrim. Many interesting things they say to each other.
Why do soldiers bother with target practice? One learns best by hitting real people.
Too much magic can be dangerous. M'aiq once had two spells and burned his sweetroll.
M'aiq carries two weapons, to be safe. What if one breaks? That would be most unlucky.
It does not matter to M'aiq how strong or smart one is. It only matters what one can do.
The people of Skyrim are more open minded about certain things than people in other places.
M'aiq knows why Falmer are blind. It has nothing to do with the Dwemer disappearing. Really.
M'aiq was soul trapped once. Not very pleasant. You should think about that once in a while.
Once M'aiq got in trouble in Riften, and fled to Windhelm. It is good that nobody there cared.
Some say Alduin is Akatosh. Some say M'aiq is a Liar. Don't you believe either of those things.
How does anyone know there was a city of Winterhold? M'aiq did not see it with his eyes. Did you?
M'aiq does not understand what is so impressive about shouting. M'aiq can shout whenever he wants.
M'aiq can travel fast across the land. Some lazy types take carriages. It is all the same to M'aiq.
Don't try blocking if you have two weapons. You will only get confused.  Much better to hit twice anyway.
M'aiq's father was also called M'aiq. As was M'aiq's father's father. At least, that's what his father said.
Nords are so serious about beards. So many beards. M'aiq thinks they wish they had glorious manes like Khajiit.
Some like taking friends on adventures. M'aiq thinks being alone is better. Less arguing about splitting treasure.
M'aiq has heard the people of Skyrim are better looking than the ones in Cyrodiil. He has no opinion on the matter. All people are beautiful to him.
No need to get snippy.
So you can be helpful sometimes.
Sweetheart, did you move my pickaxe?
It's at the south end near that loose rockpile.
No offense, of course.
None. Not back to him.
Now that was a battle!
Now there's a mystery.
I'm pretty sure she up and joined the Stormcloaks.
She ran away when the war started. Her husband, Thonnir, was devastated. No note or nothin'.
Oh, but you are wrong.
The only reason you could disagree is because you are losing so badly you cannot see it.
Only if I can help it.
But damn if I ain't almost sober.
Not anymore. Thanks to you. Friend.
Well that all depends on you, now. Doesn't it?
Hey. In the Bannered Mare, there's this bottle of Argonian Ale. The good stuff. Get it for me. They won't even know it's gone. Come on...
So serious! (Laughter)
Is that new batch of tomatoes ready for sale yet, Hillevi?
Just promise me when you get some more in, I'll have the first crack at them.
You know, I'm not sure. My husband's been tending to the vines, so I'll have to ask him.
What is it Ulfric's always saying... [QUOTE]On my honor as a Nord, I swear it.[QUOTE] (Laughter).
Some other time, then.
Sooner than you think.
That's not my problem.
I suppose I could make an exception. I do like her spiced wine.
Fine, tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
That's what I thought.
This will be worth it.
Told you that, did he?
It comforts me to know that, Bolgeir.
We lost another five guardsmen, my Jarl.
Men who, I might add, we're precious short on.
Yes, I know. The general acted with my blessing.
I'm aware of that, Bolgeir, and I appreciate your dedication.
I'm sworn to protect you, my Jarl, but I'm the last line of defense.
The first line is the walls around this city and the men who patrol them.
However, if we lose the war, the guardsmen of Solitude will make little difference in the end.
No disrespect toward the general, but sometimes I wonder if he's got your best interests at heart.
In any case he won't be turnin' me into no Imperial soldier. I know my place, and it's at your side.
It is vital that we bring Ulfric to justice, but that cannot happen until his army of Stormcloaks is defeated utterly.
If General Tullius continues to conscript our men and send them off to battle, we'll have none left to protect the city.
Vaermina forgive me...
How could you, Erandur...
Victory for Nocturnal!
Glory to the Empress of Murk!
Another soul claimed for Lady Nocturnal!
Wait, before you go...
We meet again, mortal!
Time to end your foolish charade!
We should get started.
We must succeed here today.
I'd just as soon get this over with.
Is everyone here? Let's get this started.
We must make them see their danger, Dragonborn.
I'm glad I finally got a chance to see this place.
We're counting on you to make this all worthwhile.
Talking peace with Ulfric? You must be an optimist.
I sacrificed a lot here today for this plan of yours.
Don't worry, I'll come to this peace council of yours.
We should get started. Alduin is only getting stronger.
When has any good ever come from talking to the Empire?
As soon as I get back to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready.
I hope this truce gives you what you need. It won't last.
I don't much like this truce. Feels like a betrayal to me.
That could have gone worse. Now it's up to you to deliver.
It's good to be back in High Hrothgar after all these years.
You've done well, to even get the two of them in the same room.
I'll come to your council. But I doubt any good will come of it.
I'm here to ensure that General Tullius does not exceed his authority.
And so we meet again. But this time I know who and what you really are.
When I return to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready to help trap this dragon.
You gave Ulfric more than he deserved. This will certainly prolong the war.
You'd better be able to deliver, Dragonborn. I sacrificed a lot here today.
If you can arrange an end to the fighting, Dragonsreach is at your disposal.
I don't know why you gave Ulfric so much. That murderer will never rule Skyrim.
The look on Tullius's face while the Greybeard read the terms was worth the trip.
These terms are satisfactory to my government. The truce is unlikely to last long in any case.
I'm here because it's required of me. But there's nothing to be gained by talking to that murderer.
I don't know how you convinced Ulfric to talk to the Empire. Worse than a waste of time if you ask me.
I understand this council was your idea, Dragonborn. I'm afraid I don't hold out much hope for success.
I'd give a week's pay to see the look on Ulfric's face again, when he had to swallow the terms of the truce.
I'll give you credit for boldness. But associating yourself with the Blades is a choice you will come to regret.
I'm glad you were able to negotiate a truce, but I don't trust Ulfric. He'll break his word as soon as it suits him.
I never thought I'd ever willingly stand in the same room with Tullius again. At least not without a weapon in my hand.
We were... very close.
He was a scholar, a master thief and a natural leader. Everyone respected him and followed him without question.
It was Gallus who inducted me into the Nightingales and honed my skills to a razor sharp point. I owe everything to him.
Well, if you insist...
Seems your purse is lighter than you thought.
Well, not yet, anyway.
And those are just the physical threats. Assaults on his sanity are another matter entirely.
Every day, he deals with obsequious functionaries and incompetent bureaucrats. Sadly, I'm not allowed to eliminate them.
Take your pick. Dragons, Stormcloak assassins, ambitious and unscrupulous nobles... Sometimes I think his own children want him dead.
Well... if you say so.
Well... let's hear it.
What is it, my friend?
Say on, friend. What do you need?
Oh? Something interesting, I hope?
My ears are always open to a friend's request.
I'm always glad to help a friend if I can. What do you need?
Of course! I mean... assuming you don't want me to kill someone for you. I might have to draw the line there.
What, um... What next?
Of course! I.... I'm sorry. One giant's toe. There.
What? No! Guard, help!
What? Raise the alarm!
Who are you? Intruder!
Why aren't you at your post, Justiciar?
Raise the alarm! We've been infiltrated!
What... what happened?
Worthless mercenaries.
I didn't think Maven or Mercer would allow me to get away with this, but I had little choice.
Yes, you certainly do.
You could, you know, let me out of this cage now.
Have the books, do you? I mean, I'm very glad. That's wonderful.
Let this whole thing blow over, you know. Give certain parties a chance to forget what I may have done.
Still, you've gotten me out of that cage, and I won't forget it. Thank you again, and good luck to you.
You'll be going back to the College, then? I, uhh... I think perhaps I'll wait a bit before venturing there myself.
You dare hide from me?
I still sense your presence, living fool...
You really don't know?
And now the Stormcloaks have claimed the entire city. I guess we have Roggvir to thank for that as well.
He let Ulfric Stormcloak escape Solitude. Ulfric rides in, murders the High King and Roggvir lets him ride right back out.
He opened the gate for Ulfric Stormcloak. Ulfric rides in, defeats the High King and Roggvir was the one that let him ride right back out.
You, meat! Come, come.
We go up, yes? Always up.
Such a kind nibble you are.
Do you like my pretty tower?
Petra! Petra! Curse her eyes!
Don't leave poor Melka to die.
You... You can see me?
You'll listen to this.
You're probably right.
She hardly mentions anything else.
I'm just worried about what he's teaching her.
Sondas, does Hrefna ever mention Meieran to you?
I wouldn't worry about that. He's a good elf. I trust him.
A stirring in the dark?
I feel a change in the room...
The presence of the living is near...
Ah yes, their trickery.
All right. Open her up.
Now, you. Get down there.
And a very ancient one.
The verse criticized the reigning King Olaf. He was so incensed the bard was put to death and all the copies burned.
If I'm right Svaknir and King Olaf's Verse lie in Dead Men's Respite, along with the burial chamber of King Olaf himself.
At least, that's what we thought until I translated some ancient texts a year or so ago. We now believe King Olaf buried the truth with the bard.
And another one for me.
I'll start round one. Down the hatch!
Maybe you just aren't up to the challenge...
A few drinks, a few laughs and a contest. What could be better?
If you're looking for a challenge, you've come to the right place.
And what might that be?
Are you all right, Gat?
Still shaken from all the fighting, my friend. It's been too long since I had to kill someone.
Well I'm glad you were there. I don't know how I would have gotten past the Forsworn without you.
As he should I suppose.
Hmmm, well don't take what you don't have to.
Tekla! It's good to see you, girl. How's Dengeir treating you?
Aye. She's by the fire.
I think she's sitting by the fire. Poor girl.
Ah, yes. Rented the nicest room we had for a whole month.
She had a room here. Might talk to the innkeeper about it.
Oh yeah. Pretty little thing. Been sitting by the fire all day.
Oh yeah. Pretty little thing. Had a room here I think. Ask the innkeeper.
Best we all forget about her. Bad luck to talk about the dead in Markarth.
I remember her. Her stance. The way she walked. A trained warrior, no doubt.
Divines watch over you.
Do I make myself clear?
Do you have any orders?
Still have something you need?
Still need me to do something?
You still wish something of me?
You want me to do something or not?
You wanted me to do something, yes?
Did you still need me for something?
Still something you'd like me to do?
Did you require something of J'zargo?
Do you still need me to do something?
So, did you still need my assistance?
Don't you need my help?
Each has their own way.
For me, a heavy burden.
It's like being born. Every time.
We should not be talking about that.
What did I tell you? Keep quiet about that.
This is a curse that was laid upon us. That much is clear.
To worry about the hereafter means losing sight of the now.
I keep searching for some hope of Sovngarde, but to no avail.
Especially for a new whelp, you should choose your words more carefully.
I don't know who you've been talking to, but they were clearly mistaken.
But my mind and soul remain my own. I become more than either human or beast.
I don't know what you're talking about. But if I were you, I'd hold my tongue.
A sensitive question. You may want to be careful broaching that subject with some.
I've enjoyed the boons that come with beastblood. Just like every member of the Circle.
The beastblood has given me prowess, but my soul is now forfeit to Hircine upon my death.
The old man and I have our differences when it comes to this. It's a blessing, given by Hircine.
You shouldn't even know about that. Remember you're not a full Companion yet, whelp. Know your place.
I like being stronger when I become the wolf. But Kodlak says it is bad for the soul, and I trust him.
What do I care about Sovngarde? Give me the power to tear my foes as a beast of the wild, and I will savor it.
I was raised in the woods. Hunting every animal I could see, with my father. I know them all as well as I know my own mind.
How did you... you reach beyond your station, new blood. Let's wait and see how we judge your Trial before speaking further.
And when I feel myself filling with the blood of the wolf... it's like I'm bringing all the strength of all the beasts inside me.
I think there are some things that... oh, wait. Are you trying to trick me? You are not a full-blood yet. We can't talk about that.
Kodlak is right, though. We've given a piece of our souls for this power. I know my mythic histories. Bargains like that lead to ruin.
Free of charge for you.
Hello, Silana. Would you like an apple?
That's generous, Jala, but I am happy to pay my way.
Get it over with, then.
Give em the dogs, boys!
Get him! Rip his throat out!
Just shut up and play the game.
Sounds like easy money to me. You're on.
I'll do you ten gold at three to one on the white one.
I'm just saying that these ceramic lamps make me nervous. They just seem so... fragile.
So you're the one who's been down there killing all my wolves. You're gonna die for that!
Give it your best shot!
Good luck, Nightingale.
Choose your path and your journey will be complete.
Gourmet? Why I... Um...
Oh dear. You're going to kill me now, aren't you?
Have it your way, then.
Ataf keeps making eyes at me.
You should tell him to mind his own business.
Aia. You're so mean. I don't think he means anything by it.
He said he loved me....
You should be more careful with the men you pick, dear.
Real men prove their love. Words are as empty as the air they run through.
Here, for your trouble.
Stendarr's Mercy to you. If my Horgeir doesn't give up the mead this time, I'll hit him over the head with it.
Here, this should help.
So, Maven wants to hunt down Sabjorn's private partner, huh?
You're welcome to take a look around Sabjorn's office. He keeps most of his papers stashed in his desk.
Hmm? What's this about?
All that remains now is to bestow the title upon you.
Then allow me to officially welcome you to Riften. You'll make a fine addition to our city.
Oh, yes. Of course... the whole thane thing. I'd forgotten. If you're ready then, can we get this out of the way?
Honor to you, my Thane.
Long life to you, Thane.
What do you need, my Thane?
I am your sword and your shield.
Honored to see you again, my Thane.
The Jarl has appointed me to be your housecarl. It's an honor to serve you.
I am not! You're lying!
Look at you! You're as filthy as a pig in a pen!
You're a liar! I won't listen to you. Leave me alone!
You smell like a pig's pen, too. What a stink! Have you been rolling in the dirt all day?
I can't talk right now.
I don't have any business with you, so get out of my face.
I doubt that very much.
Let 'em go, Hewnon. All clear.
No need to get hasty. I... I was just testing you. You can go on ahead.
I like your shop, Lami.
Yes, I'm sure that's true.
Oh, of course! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that it's not.
Morthal will be mine to govern someday. I have a great deal to learn.
Thank you, dear. It must be nice to get out of the hall every now and then.
Oh, I quite like living in the hall. Mother says it's an honor to live there and serve Morthal.
I... Yes, I understand.
Falion, I am disappointed.
I don't even want to know what it is you've been doing.
You've been exploring places you shouldn't, and you know it.
I'm told that you're up to something out in the marsh, Falion.
It doesn't happen again, or else I'll have you thrown in jail. Clear?
It stops at once, or else there will be consequences of an unpleasant nature. Do you understand?
I'll keep that in mind.
What in the name of Oblivion is going on in this place?
Hey, I still have a contact in Valenwood that may have some work for us. You're welcome to join me.
Yeah, I know what you mean. If things don't start getting better soon, I may look for work elsewhere.
I'll see what I can do.
Brand-Shei, do you think you can find me some theilul?
That's fine. I have a special occasion coming up, and I'd like to have it.
The Argonian sugar-cane wine? It's pretty hard to get around here. Very expensive.
I'm with you, Listener.
No... No, this cannot be...
Astrid did the right thing, and now it's your turn. End her suffering.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. It's all right. You've been through a lot. Maybe you should just sit down for a bit...
I've got my eye on you.
Hmmm... You can go, but you stay on your best behavior now.
Then perhaps you care to explain why you are standing so close a dead body with your weapon drawn?
Hmm... If you happen to recollect anything about the incident, you be sure to report to the captain of the guard.
If only that were true.
In a Daedra, of course.
Excellent. Now, you must come with me. You've become a part of this. You must be present for the ritual.
It's a religious thing.
Oh, good. I wanted to try that out as soon as possible.
Try it out? What would you need a leather harness for anyway?
Oh, Haelga... there you are. Your special order from Hammerfell came in off the last Khajiit caravan.
It's really dead, then?
Something's happening...
What manner of magic is this?
Look out! Don't get too close!
It's like the ancient legends. Dragonborn...
By the gods... I don't even know what to say...
It can't be... You... You took its very soul...
In all my years, I've never seen such a thing...
It may be dead now, but... where did it come from?
I never would have believed it, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes...
Just leave me in peace.
I'll be here when you're done.
Come back when you grow a backbone.
I hope Brynjolf chokes on his gold.
I can't stand this city. It's impossible to make a decent living here.
Let's see them make us.
Dealing with a mob wouldn't be good for my coin purse. Fine. We're leaving.
Meet me at my quarters.
All right, let's not overdo it.
Mind your own business.
We've got nothing to talk about.
Mmm hmm. Anything else?
