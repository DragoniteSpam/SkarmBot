Not a day goes by that I don't regret letting Sabjorn get as far as he did.
In only a few short years, he's taken that bile he calls mead to market and a chunk of my profits with it!
I couldn't let her run off to that pretender Eorlund Gray-Mane, could I?
I almost didn't. I wasn't sure I could stomach having some Imperial tell me how to live my life.
I was ready to pack my things when Hermir came to me. She wanted to make sure I'd finish teaching her the smithing trade.
That girl's determination won me over. I suppose it didn't hurt that she said she only wanted to learn from the best smith in Skyrim.
I did. Strange days when the monks will do that. I wonder what it means.
I was just outside Ivarstead when it happened. It's an exciting moment. Nothing like this has happened in centuries.
I don't, I'm afraid. Ranmir didn't talk much about her after she'd left.
He seemed convinced that she'd run off with someone named Vex. That's all I remember.
I expect to be informed if they make any future attempts to contact you.
This! This... Orb. The Eye of Magnus, whatever you want to call it. It's clearly powerful, and no doubt they want it for themselves!
I expected too much. I'll seek someone else to salvage the family honor.
I grant you this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Hjaalmarch. Congratulations.
I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now.
I knew I could count on Irileth. But there must be more to it than that.
I think you'll be a superb addition to the College. Welcome, Apprentice.
I'll lead you across the bridge. Once you're inside you'll want to speak with Mirabelle Ervine, our Master Wizard. Please, follow me.
I'll try and hold them off as best I can. You get back to the Sanctuary!
Astrid ordered me to keep an eye on you. Figured you could use a hand when the chaos erupted.
I'm bored. What do you say we go smash a few heads in? This one's on me.
You've been a worthy patron. Shall I join you once more, free of charge?
Since you paid my fee recently, I suppose it's only fair that I join you once more.
Back for more? Since we had so much fun the last time, I'll join you free of charge.
If you still need my blade, I'll join you. I want to make sure you get your money's worth.
I could really use some more experience in the field. I'd be happy to join you again, and it won't cost a thing.
In exchange for Markarth, the source of most of Skyrim's silver? Hardly.
In exchange for Markarth, the source of most of Skyrim's silver? Hardly. I might rather consider Whiterun.
Riften seems like a better choice to me. Well-fortified, easily resupplied across Lake Honrich. Plus all the mead we can drink.
It's easy - stay inside the boundaries and only use the practice arrows.
It's not any of your bother, so I don't see what you're apologizing for.
It's not the most exciting answer but the most likely. I'll write it in.
Ivarstead? So close to Riften? She's an even bigger fool than I thought.
Leifnarr said they'd pay double what you can usually get at the markets.
The catch was, he had to head out there with our wood. So not only is Leifnarr gone, but a good bit of our supplies as well.
Well, he said that a few men have been going by to some of the local farms promising a good price from all the local mills and farms.
Look, if you want arrows we have them, but don't insult my intelligence.
Why of course. And will you also be needing the bow that shoots rainbows? Or perhaps a quiver that dispenses beer?
Need you to deliver some false orders to the Imperial Legate in Morthal.
But first we need to get our hands on some rebel orders to make the forgeries.
I need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar.
But first we need to get our hands on some Imperial orders to make the forgeries.
No time to talk. Snitch or double-cross me and I'll kill you. I mean it!
No. As if trade wasn't poor enough. Now there's violence in the streets.
It was the Forsworn, wasn't it? I lose dozens of shipments every season to those barbarians. Now they're in the city? Gods help us.
Not sure I understand the question. The Legion's always been in Skyrim.
We are the true sons and daughters of Skyrim, and Ulfric... he's the truest of us all.
We fight to make our land great once more, to raise up strong, noble thanes, and lay low false Jarls and the cowards who hide behind them.
We have garrisons throughout all the provinces of the Empire. Our mission is to serve the Emperor, uphold the law, and protect the citizenry.
At first they called us that to belittle our cause. But we gladly accept being named for Ulfric Stormcloak, the only true High King of Skyrim.
Skyrim's days are darkening, and the Legion will soon be called into service like never before. But we stand ready, as always, to meet that call.
The sound of our fury is a storm about to break on the heads of our enemies. Our friendship, a cloak of true brotherhood for all who would wear it.
Now, if were done being sentimental, it's time for you to take the Oath.
Not at all. That was as much a test of your abilities as it was your resolve.
I wasn't sure your heart was in it. But you've proven me wrong. And I respect that.
Oh, I have the utmost faith in your success, believe me. So let's begin.
Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him.
You'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal rather easily.
Oh, yes. It's all been foretold. The end has begun. Alduin has returned.
Only a Dragonborn can stop him. But no Dragonborn has been known for centuries.
It seems that the gods have grown tired of us. They've left us to our fate, as the plaything of Alduin the World-Eater.
Sides quickly formed behind these men and the Ratway became a bloodbath.
The Guild was thrown into disarray. Several stepped up and tried to claim Gallus's former position as Guild Master.
So... you spoke to Paarthurnax. The dragonblood burns bright within you.
Did he tell you what you wanted to know? Did he teach you the Dragonrend Shout?
Sorry, but you'll have to find someone else to help you with your prank.
Sure, fine. Thanks for nothing. You already got what you needed from me.
Surprised? I guess I'm getting pretty good at my harmless innkeeper act.
That was good work. Deeja's in the hold of the ship. Go down two levels.
The finest skooma, the sweetest moon sugar. At a fair price, of course.
The Hall of Valor, where heroes wait to follow Shor to the final battle.
Don't you know? What drew you here? Surely your dreams showed you the way?
The Silver Hand has been scouring the world for more pieces of Wuuthrad.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of the Pale. Congratulations.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. Congratulations.
They practically own the city of Markarth. And we're here on their coin.
You haven't heard of the Silver-Blood family? They're the most important people in the Reach.
To see through Magnus' Eye without being blinded, you require his staff.
Events now spiral quickly towards the inevitable center, so you must act with haste. Take this knowledge to your Arch-Mage.
You, and those aiding you, wish to know more about the Eye of Magnus. You wish to avoid the disaster of which you are not yet aware.
Vahrukt unslaad... perhaps none but me now remember how he was defeated.
True. But few now remember that this was the very spot where Alduin was defeated by the ancient Tongues.
We won't kill you, outlander, but we don't want you here. Remember that.
Ha. We admire your fighting spirit, Orc-Kin. You'll fit right in here. Come inside.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle out in the Pale.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle up in Haafingar.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle over in the Rift.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle up in Hjaalmarch.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle down in Falkreath.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle over in Eastmarch.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle over in the Reach.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle all the way in Winterhold.
We've gotten a letter about someone needing some muscle right here in Whiterun Hold.
What makes you think I know anything? Everyone knows he's dead and gone!
Which is utterly useless at the moment. You need to fill it with a soul.
Very well. Meet me at the summoning circle in the marsh at dawn. We shall banish the creature you have become.
Yes, that's right.  Look around you. Most of the lands you see are mine.
Most of this I purchased while my comrades were fighting in the south, helping the Empire against the Aldmeri Dominion.
Back then, nothing would grow here and so the land was worthless. Now, thanks to hard work and the gods' blessings, our farms prosper.
You aren't the first one to have gotten this far. You won't be the last.
You were seen coming in. The girl at the door is a Forsworn agent masquerading as a maid.
You fighter types are always underfoot. You want me to clean? Then scat!
I really must get back to my duties. This fort isn't going to clean itself.
You have been a worthy tool. Fill the world with destruction in my name.
Place your hands on my altar one last time, and you will witness the power of Mehrunes Dagon for yourself.
You mean the official sort of business? Hmm, well... no. No, not really.
You should try that bit on the barkeep. Maybe get yourself a free drink.
You? You are nothing. An empty vapor, dispersed by the slightest breeze.
We are forged by Boethiah's example. We carve our will upon the world through our tongues and our blades.
You've honored my father's memory in more ways than I have words to say.
Ah, but you look tired. Come, share a bottle of Honningbrew Mead with me!
All right, Delvin. What gives with that case of Shadowbanish you sold me?
What do you mean? That wine tastes finer than anythin' Surilie Brothers ever made.
Am I responsible if the vintage was off on that case? Sorry, you know the rules Vekel. No refunds.
Sure, it tastes great. Only one problem. You said it can make the darkness as clear as day when you drink it. Guess what? It doesn't.
All right. I wrote down the last place I'd heard about. Don't get killed.
Allow me to present you with this compensation for your selfless efforts.
Well done! Your continued efforts have been of great benefit to the people of Riften.
Here, this should suffice as your cut of the... or rather, a reward for your actions. Now, if you'll excuse me...
I'll send my men to secure any of the remaining goods you left behind. We can't have that substance falling into the wrong hands now, can we?
As steward, I serve as an intermediary between the Jarl and her subjects.
I also handle the less important and day-to-day policies that effect daily life in Riften.
I'm not certain what business it is of yours, but I'm moth... I mean Jarl Maven's steward.
Lately I've had my hands full suppressing these ridiculous accusations of corruption in the keep.
I run the prisons in Riften, keep the riff-raff from robbing the good folk of this city and have drunks tossed into the lake.
But enough talk. Come! Won't you share a drink with me and my companions?
But I see that spark in your eye and I know better than to warn you away.
I couldn't ask you to undertake such a trecherous journey, it would be a fool's errand.
Grimsever rests with the Dwemer ruin of Mzinchaleft. Tread carefully, friend... those same ruins almost took my life.
But, I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis. It cannot be known to me.
Alduin komeyt tiid. What else would you seek? Alduin and Dovahkiin return together.
cheerful laughter with a friend as you walk off to drink and swap stories
A cup I'll gladly raise in company with you. None have yet bested me in boasting or drinking.
Come, let us share a cup of mead, and trade tales of our time on Mundus, reliving the glory of our remembered deeds.
Comes the end of the day, Imperials and Stormcloaks ain't much different.
I'm sure my brother Vignar is, since they made him Jarl after throwing Balgruuf out.
Both sides want to tell you how you should live your life. Guess I'd rather hear it from a real Nord than some Emperor down south.
Congratulations. You've altered the fate of a Daedric artifact and lived.
Go ahead. Take it. I'd sooner finally put this chapter of my life behind me.
Did you think we'd accept a heartfelt apology and let bygones be bygones?
This is the Thieves Guild, genius. How do you think? With gold. A lot of gold.
Evenaar bahlok. There are many hungers it is better to deny than to feed.
Dreh ni nahkip. Discipline against the lesser aids in qahnaar... denial of the greater.
Faralda can teach Destruction spells, and offers training in that school.
Gerdur's family first settled here as wood cutters a few generations ago.
She and Hod run the mill. I make a decent living sharpening axes and fixing the sawmill.
It's my mill. Some folks think it's my town too, but it ain't. The Jarl in Whiterun owns the land and the town. I just pay the taxes.
Good. If you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Now get going.
Hail, friend! It's good to see another merry soul enjoying this fine day.
He is? I'm not sure how to feel about that.  Perhaps it's for the better.
Hmm? What? Project? You think you could help me? I really don't think so.
Ah, indeed? The Jarl... Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons.
I got mine off of a merchant ship in Solitude. Worst mistake I ever made.
The Dunmer came up with the stuff a long time ago. Very illegal and very hard to come by.
I'm not sure what it's made from, but I can tell you that once you've had a taste, you'll never crave anything else.
I hope it was important, because it means you weren't here to defend him.
I knew you had it in you. After all, finding the Stones was no easy feat.
Well, I'm not one to welch on a deal, so here's your reward. I hope you put it to good use. I know I have.
I need to ask you to stop. That... shouting... is making people nervous.
I need to get into my traveling gear. Give me a minute and I'll be ready.
I need you to collect some dragon scales. And not just any dragon scales.
I see. The dragon will lead you to Alduin, but without the Jarl's help...
I still have my key to the library. Whenever you're ready, let's move on.
I suppose it would be better than sitting around thinking about all this.
I'll be damned if I'm going to lose her to... well, to whatever they are.
Look, in case you hadn't noticed, these aren't the glory days of the Guild.
We've lost more clients in the last decade than I'd care to count, but Maven's stuck with us through throughout the entire ordeal.
I'm glad you agree. I was starting to wonder whose side you were on here.
Well. Good! You favor the Empire less than I feared. Maybe we will be able to come to some agreement here after all.
If you wouldn't mind bringing this back to her for us, I'd appreciate it.
It's a shame our daughter couldn't make the journey herself, but at least she still thinks of us.
It's true. For as long as I can remember our crops have always done well.
I'm not sure whether it's the soil, the climate or the favor of the Divines, but we've never had a poor harvest.
Look, I didn't ask for this job, I got stuck with it thanks to my father.
If you're trying to ask if I tend the hall of the dead alone, then the answer is yes.
You think anyone around here is going to lift a shovel to help me? Guess again. [QUOTE]Leave the dirty work to old Alessandra.[QUOTE]
Mara will always accept into her arms should you seek return to her fold.
Do not forsake your heart, child, for it may one day come to surprise you.
No one does. I've even taken the damn thing to the College of Winterhold.
I must have spent every last coin I've made with the Guild trying to find out what it means.
No risk, no reward. That's the way it goes, so you better get used to it.
Now... if you're done bellyaching like a child, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?
No. Indeed not. But beware that your skill does not outstrip your wisdom.
Oh no! No, no, no. Narfi never got to say goodbye! Now Narfi's all alone.
At least Narfi has Reyda's Necklace... reminds Narfi of his sister. Thank you for giving this to Narfi.
On top of the Throat of the World is a patch of snow that's never melted.
They say the Greybeards taught it to ignore the sun, and heat simply washes over it.
The original Phial was made from this snow. We'll only need a small bit for the repairs.
So I ran. Joined the Forsworn. Started killing. Got caught. Now I'm here.
A Nord nobleman I served was stabbed in the night. Wasn't me, but I knew I'd be blamed.
Stendarr's mercy - you aren't one of them. Please, you've got to help me!
Surely even down in Cyrodiil people have heard news of the war in Skyrim?
He's always used the ban on the worship of Talos to stir people up against the Empire.
Ulfric is our rightful High King. He's leading the fight to drive the Empire out of Skyrim, once and for all.
You haven't heard of the civil war in Skyrim? I guess down in Cyrodiil people have other things to worry about.
It's pretty simple. Ulfric founded the Stormcloaks years ago, as a sort of private army to advance his ambitions.
He never succeeded in getting much support, so a few months ago he murdered the High King! That got the Empire's attention.
The Nords are tired of spending our blood fighting the Empire's wars, and paying for the Empire's decadence with our taxes.
Thanks for the help. Not many willing to take on the Forsworn these days.
That is an old tale, but well known to those of us who serve in the keep.
And so, from that time until this, our great keep has been called [QUOTE]Dragonsreach.[QUOTE]
Olaf returned in triumph to Whiterun. By his decree, the city's keep was rebuilt as a prison for Numinex.
The struggle between Olaf and the dragon culminated in a mighty duel atop Mount Anthor, with Olaf the victor.
Long ago, there lived a mighty hero of the Nords. Olaf One-Eye. Olaf did battle with a fearsome dragon named Numinex.
The Braidwood Inn's up that way. I know the innkeeper - Iddra. Nice lady.
This is Karthwasten. Mining town. I hear they've had a lot of trouble with the Forsworn.
Here we are. Dawnstar. Capital of the Pale. Don't get up this way much. Beautiful country though.
Shor's Stone - pissant little town, not even an inn. Just a bunch of miners scratching in the dirt.
That's the Honningbrew Meadery. Supposed to be a big rivalry between them and the Black-Briars of Riften.
Remember when that used to be the Honningbrew Meadery? Didn't stand a chance against those Black-Briars of Riften.
This here's the Darkwater. Comes down from Lake Honrich into the White River, a few miles downstream. Good fishing, I hear.
This here's Rorikstead. Quiet place. Good people, though. You can get a room and a mug at the Frostfruit Inn if you care to stay.
I can't say I've been to Winterhold more than a handful of times. Can't see much reason most honest folk would want to come up here.
Morthal, capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Not quite in the same league as Solitude or Whiterun, but a nice enough place if you like swamps.
Well, this is Falkreath. Not much to look at if you're used to the bigger cities, but the folk here are friendly enough if you give them a chance.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Falkreath. Congratulations.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Haafingar. Congratulations.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of the Reach. Congratulations.
I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
Then the leader of our clan... Garthek... he ordered us to kill the rest.
They didn't put up much of a fight. All that was left were the women and the children.
We raided a caravan one spring... I think it was a few wagons with some farmers moving to a new village.
Then you finally know what it means to be a true hunter, in the Nord way.
For this you have earned the Blessing of Kyne, and can count me as a friend.
You do Kyne proud. Only one challenge remains. Go and defeat the troll champion.
There's a... ghost. Just wandering around my inn like it owned the place.
He's from the battle, I just know it. He's one of Tiber Septim's soldiers... back from the dead.
Yes. I've heard stories that Old Hroldan was haunted, but no ones seen a ghost here since the Great War.
Until the Key is returned, I will never set foot inside that place again.
I also need to reassure Maven that it's business as usual without Mercer... and that a new Guild Master will soon be taking over.
I've been a Nightingale for a very long time. I sold my allegiance to Nocturnal in exchange for many profitable years of thieving.
Falling in love with Gallus was wrong. It was a distraction that allowed the Sepulcher to be desecrated and it likely cost him his life.
Right now, the Guild needs someone to maintain order. Everyone is awaiting the news of Mercer's demise; it couldn't be a more precarious time.
Well, it shows. Your skill rivals some of the greatest miners I've known.
I've been watching the way you mine and I have to say, I'm very impressed.
Thank you. It's nice to know someone admires me for more than just my appearance.
I owe it all to my father who started me swinging the pickaxe when I was a barefoot little girl.
What? Who are you? Oh, never mind. Cut me down before that thing gets us!
You did it. You killed it. Now cut me down before anything else shows up.
What's that you said? Dragonborn? Then... there really is hope after all?
You'd better come inside. Quickly now. Thalmor agents have been seen in the Ratway.
When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it. Otherwise, mind your business.
Another batch of logs completely ruined. I swear, these bears have it out for me.
I hardly think the bears are clever enough to hold a grudge against you, Miss Temba.
When my wife died, I wasn't sure I could let her go. Now I don't have to.
When my husband died, I wasn't sure I could let him go. Now I don't have to.
I was a little scared at first, but I like having my sister around. It's comforting.
I was a little scared at first, but I like having my brother around. It's comforting.
A parent should never outlive a child. Having my son's spirit here... it's as if he never died.
A parent should never outlive a child. Having my daughter's spirit here... it's as if she never died.
My father's been haunting me ever since he died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad he's here.
My mother's been haunting me ever since she died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad she's here.
Who in Dagon's name are you? Speak, or I'll cut you down where you stand.
Wonderful. I hadn't really hoped to run in to someone who had been there.
Yes, yes. Which is why I allowed this... violation of all our traditions.
You don't have to, because it's utter nonsense. It's never going to work.
What was I thinking? It would never work that first way. Why didn't you tell me?
No, no, no. What I need to do is to reverse that. Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent and then apply it with the proper incantation.
You mistake me. I'm not saying no - just wondering about your intentions.
We're not looking for sellswords. The Stormcloaks need dedicated men and women who're devoted to the cause and willing to die for it.
You were at Helgen when it was attacked? You saw this with your own eyes?
A heathen. Lovely. Oh, don't put on that angry look. I'm just teasing you.
The temple offers her blessings to pilgrims and instruction in enjoying all life has to offer.
Dibella is the Divine of Beauty. She is a patron deity to artists and bards and those who seek life's simple pleasures.
Ah, excellent. Well, it's good to know that won't be a problem any longer.
Ah, excellent. Well, here's the gold the Jarl offered in exchange for taking care of the problem.
Ah, there's nothing like fresh air and honest labor to bolster the spirit.
True enough, but there's nothing wrong with a little adventure now and then. Not much excitement in working the soil every day.
And speak to Eorlund if you want a better weapon than... whatever that is.
Another time, or not at all. It's really none of your business, after all.
Are you kidding me? I fought off all those bandits. I'm not afraid of you.
All right... All right... Fine. I thought we were friends, but you're a real jerk, you know that?
Aye. Aringoth sent the city guard packing and fortified the entire island.
In fact, Vex barely made it out of there alive. You should talk to her about it before you go.
Bring all four to me, and I shall use them to inscribe the spells for you.
Knowledge of truly powerful Illusion spells is here at the College, but it is hidden from those who might misuse it.
I shall teach you a spell to discern things hidden from others. With it, you will be able to acquire the texts you need.
By Imperial Law banning Talos, we have the right to do whatever we want.
Destroy Vighar, my long dead vampire ancestor. Have you changed your mind?
The truth is less pleasant. It is...was, the grave of Vighar, my own ancestor, dead for centuries now.
You may have seen the open grave in our graveyard. Most of the townsfolk think it's the work of a corpse thief.
He is also a vampire. My family is entrusted with keeping him buried, but recently someone stole the wardstone, and Vighar escaped.
Did you? So Ulag didn't make it passed those giants then? More's the pity.
If you found any of the sap, I'd be willing to pay you the same cut I offered him. Better price than you are likely to find otherwise.
Do you hate the dark elves? Are you here to bully us and tell us to leave?
Far back in the Mythic Era, the dragons were worshipped as gods in Skyrim.
I'm not surprised you've never heard of it. Even I used to think it was just a myth.
Many of the monumental ruins that still dot the landscape were, in fact, built as temples to the dragons.
But not anymore. The Dragon War was a real event, although only the barest glimmer of the actual events has come down to us.
The details are lost, but at some point the Nords rebelled. After a long and terrible war, the Nords overthrew their dragon overlords.
Fine. I'll wait until someone else with a little more courage comes along.
First, let us see if you truly are Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice.
From Riverwood? The road south through Falkreath is the most direct route.
Or you could catch the carriage from Whiterun to Markarth and then approach from the west.
Either way, the Reach is wild country these days. The Forsworn are everywhere. Best be careful.
He's been complaining of a member of the College running amok in his hold.
She's been complaining of a member of the College running amok in her hold.
Head on in. Keep your nose clean, and you won't have any problems with us.
Hey friend, you wouldn't happen to be looking for unusual items would you?
Hmm. It feels like a mistake to me, but I'll bow to your judgment on this.
Hrmph. You're no fun at all. Guess I'll have to make my own fun elsewhere.
And with the pup back, I'll be restored to my full power. There's a whole world just waiting for me!
I can see it in your eyes - you've seen the land of the gods and returned.
I knew that stupid kid would try and find a way to weasel out of his debt.
Look, this is really simple. I lent him some gold, he promised to pay me back and now he says he's broke. End of story.
I overheard Bolli say that only the Jarl carries the key to the warehouse.
When I meet Sarthis there, he's usually waiting for me outside with his bodyguard.
I pay a good wage for any iron ore you dig up, if you're looking for work.
I own Iron-Breaker Mine. We make twice as much coin as those horkers over in Quicksilver Mine, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
I play the lute. If you'd like to hear something, it only costs five gold.
I warned them it might be dangerous. It's not my fault they didn't listen.
As long as the Synod don't blame us for this mess, I have more pressing matters to deal with.
I'd appreciate if you don't bother my wife, Tova. She's still in mourning.
I'm a Dark Elf and I live in Windhelm, so yes, I live in the Gray Quarter.
You must be new around here, or you'd know they don't let my kind live anywhere outside that slum.
I'm afraid the Winterhold you see before you is somewhat... underwhelming.
I'm afraid there's not much to be said. Winterhold is hardly what it used to be.
What's there to tell? It's mostly gone now, thanks to those damned mages in the College.
Most of the business we get is from folks here to visit the College, though even that's dried up some.
I can assure you, though, that it was quite something in its prime. An early capital of Skyrim, you know.
Someday there'll be proof they caused the Great Collapse. Most of a city just dropping off into the sea... That doesn't just happen.
Sadly, the Oblivion Crisis took its toll on Winterhold, in more ways than one. Then, the Great Collapse swallowed most of our beloved city.
You can talk to Birna if you need to buy anything. She doesn't have much, but could certainly use the coin. And then there's our little inn.
If it was easy, I would have hired a local thug instead of a professional.
One more thing. If you get caught, I can't afford to be connected to you. Remember that before you do anything stupid.
You see both of these items are kept inside Dragonsreach, and they don't allow visitors inside the Jarl's or the Steward's chambers.
If this plan works, not only is my debt gone, but I'll be set up for life.
And guess who gets to run the Black-Briar Meadery in Whiterun? You're looking at him.
Maven and I worked out a little deal. If Sabjorn ends up in jail, she's going to take over his meadery.
If you don't trust me, you were a fool to walk in here in the first place.
Important? Far more than even she realizes! If you are Dragonborn, then...
In return, Maven allowed us to extort Aringoth and bring in a huge payout.
We had an arrangement with Maven. We kept an eye on Goldenglow Estate to make sure the honey kept flowing.
If the workers had a dispute, we'd rough them up. If competitors tried to buy honey from Aringoth, we'd steal the shipments.
Is everything all right? I've not heard from Sorli or Pactur in some time.
It's an honor, champion. Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven.
It's an old city, I can tell you that. The Palace of the Kings is ancient.
Still, Candlehearth Hall's got decent food and cheap bunks. You could do worse.
The Argonians can't even live inside the walls. They're all stuck out on the docks.
It's not the friendliest place for outsiders. The Dark Elves were all forced to live in a slum called the Gray Quarter.
Just make certain you keep your eyes open. Karliah is as sharp as a blade.
The last thing I need is you blundering into a trap and warning her that we're here.
Let's just call it a [QUOTE]difference of opinion[QUOTE] with the College.
They were interested in research that goes outside the bounds of what the College allows, so they were... persuaded to leave.
Let's see if you can make a hide helmet. Here's the rest of what you need.
Ah, good. A lot of weapons and armor need leather for straps, fittings, that kind of thing.
Not much. One moment I was buying a necklace, and the rest is just a blur.
Oh, they care all right. Just none of them thinks to do anything about it.
They say I'm just snooping around bothering people, but I'm trying to save lives!
One taste will lead to nearly instant death, so don't even think about it.
It's a rare plant, found only on the island of Stros M'Kai. It can be served like any vegetable - cut up, put in a salad, perhaps boiled in a stew.
Our contract is complete. Here's a token of my gratitude for your efforts.
Yes, I know. In fact, by now, Captain Volf should be on his way to the prisons.
Oh, convey my compliments to Delvin for me. Tell him I'll be happy to reopen whatever doors he needs in Solitude.
Please, tell me more about yourself. What brings you to this... to Skyrim?
Ri'saad is the head of a small syndicate of independent merchant families.
If we could make contact with them, they could provide an excellent way to inconspicuously transport goods for us.
Each caravan is obliged to pay dues, but in return a small portion of the profits are shared between them and the leader parcels out the routes.
Shor's Crown, that woman never gives up. I guess that's why I married her.
You're a real friend saving this mead from her. Here, let me show you how to block a punch that might be coming from some angry spouse, huh?
So you can tell that heartless Daedra bitch I'm done doing her dirty work.
Mind my words or I'll mind them for you: I'm slave to no man, no god, and no Daedra.
Whenever a man's life is saved by armor made with these hands, these hands have changed that man's destiny and his family's.
Boethiah talks about leaving your mark, a sign of your passing.... Well, you can make a mark on the world without treachery and murder.
Ssshhh.... Please. There is much... I have to say. And... not much time...
I'm sorry. So very sorry. The Penitus Oculatus... Maro... He said that by giving you to them, he would leave the Dark Brotherhood alone. Forever.
By Sithis, I was such a fool. All of this... it's all my fault. You are the best of us, and I nearly killed you... as I've killed everyone else...
Thank the gods. Now let's deal with these other hunters. We hunt together!
Then I need your help and there isn't anyone I can trust here in the city.
There ain't much more to tell... they're haunted and you should stay away.
Look, I've seen one of the spirits with my very own eyes. When it glared at me, I swear it burned right through my soul.
They've been told to stay out of the city, but keep trying to get back in.
Bunch of foreign troublemakers. Wandering around, getting into mischief, scaring the citizens.
We are the only group left in Skyrim dedicated to the study of the arcane.
There are others who study, to be sure, but they do so in private, and often in secret.
We intend to prove the superiority of Mer over Man, one century at a time.
The Thalmor saved all of Elven-kind during the Oblivion Crisis. We've been watching over our lands for 200 years.
We re-founded the Aldmeri Dominion, an alliance between us and our Bosmer cousins. You might know them from their common name. Wood elves.
Well... maybe not. Dragons haven't been seen in Skyrim for an age or more.
Besides, you have your own score to settle with the Empire now. And with that dragon.
But wherever that dragon came from, and whatever it wants, Ulfric will get to the bottom of it. You can count on that.
Where they operate within the shadows, we operated on the side of justice.
No. In fact, the Tong were quite the bitter rivals with the Dark Brotherhood.
You must be mad to think I'd allow anyone to see it before it's completed.
Preposterous! That research represents years of personal toil in some of the most dangerous Dwemer ruins in Skyrim!
You want to pay me to do my job? Fine. I'll mark the location on your map.
You watch yourself on that island. Those mercenaries don't take prisoners.
You? An outsider? I'd sooner slit my own throat than accept help from you.
To even consider it would be such a sign of weakness that I might as well abandon my tribe now.
You'll be provided all of the power and knowledge befitting a Nightingale.
By transacting the Oath with Nocturnal, you're entering into a business deal.
You're free to use those powers as you see fit to further your own goals or the goals of the Thieves Guild.
You're just going to walk away from your betrothal? Get out of the temple.
Ysmir's beard! You're one after my own heart. I would love another bottle.
Aela said you were hers, and I wasn't supposed to interfere. She scares me.
My advice? Always be honest with the old man, but don't tell him anything he doesn't need to know.
Aela's laid claim to your services, and I've learned the hard way not to upset her. Best you stick to her for now.
And there is more work to be done, but I fear that Kodlak's gotten wind of our recent efforts. He's asked to see you.
Ah, there we have it. This will be all I need to have Ogmund taken care of.
I would like to personally thank you on behalf of myself and the Thalmor for your assistance. Here, for your work.
An astute question, for we are far from home and this is a cold, hard land.
The dragons and the war have scared many other traders away, but for those with courage, there is much profit to be made.
The wise trader finds the best opportunities, even if he must travel far to find them. Skyrim is a ripe opportunity indeed.
Besides, you look like your pockets are a little light on coin, am I right?
Expecting free information, eh? Help me deal with business first, then we'll see how I can help you.
But you will know him when you see him. He's the one who made me like this!
But... he has forbidden me from saying his name. He says it distracts him, and woe to those who draw his ire.
He is a great man, but one rarely praised! He rules twin empires that span the length and breadth of our minds! All know him, but few can name him!
Confound it all. I was quite sure I was invisible, or at least transparent.
Constance tries to stop her, and is real good to us, but it's never enough.
I hate her. Everyone hates her. She's the meanest person I ever met. Sometimes she even locks us in the... room.
Delvin Mallory and the Dark Brotherhood have... history. He can be trusted.
And, there's only one man who can give us what we need - Delvin Mallory. He's a fence, a private operator. Works out of the Ratway, in Riften.
I'm thinking we need that amulet appraised. I want to know where it came from, how much it's worth, and if we can actually get away with selling it.
Give me the letter. Bring Mallory the amulet. Find out everything you can, and sell it if he's willing. He'll offer a letter of credit - that's fine.
Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven, if you have the strength.
There, there. It will pass. Going too long without a proper meal can make the stomach weak.
Great! I'll unlock the door and meet you inside, then you can lead the way.
He is the God of Mercy. The patron of order and justice for all of Tamriel.
We bring his compassion where none can be found, by cleansing all those who would offend his children.
Here, this is all can afford to give you as compensation. Hope it's enough.
I don't know how you got it back, and I don't want to know. Frankly, I don't even care... I'm just so glad to see it again.
Hey, greenskin... close your mouth. Some of us are trying to eat over here.
Or perhaps you should crawl back into whatever swamp you came from, lizard man.
You're not going to goad me into a fight so I'll get kicked out, Grelka. Eat your food and leave me in peace.
There's no need to be rude, Grelka. If you don't care for Argonians, then perhaps you should take residence somewhere else.
Hmmm... A question I am all to familiar with. One my very Thanes ask often.
They worry that Tullius is so focused on the war, that he risks forgetting what's best for our people.
The real irony is that, while General Tullius is certainly no Nord, the people of Skyrim would be lost without him.
Trust is always difficult, especially for my people. Yet we must trust in Tullius' leadership. For what other choice do we have?
I bumped into them when I was coming back to my farm after buying supplies.
It was a family heirloom. I can't even put a price on how much that thing means to me.
I know those lowlifes took it with them back to the Ratway. They left an unmistakable stench behind.
I don't blame you for being angry about it. I would be, too, in your shoes.
But it was all a mistake. You weren't supposed to be on that cart with those Stormcloak traitors.
And the Imperial Legion needs your help, especially now, with that dragon out there somewhere, and Ulfric back on the loose.
I still can't believe he knew what he was doing when he opened that gate...
I would simply ask that you trust me and help me end Dawnstar's nightmares.
I've already said too much. If anyone overhears what we're saying, it could start a panic.
I... see. I trust that Tolfdir will provide a more... specific explanation.
I'm ever so grateful. Please, give my regard to the rest of the Companions.
I'm sorry to hear that. I thought you'd finally seen through Ulfric's lies.
I'm still looking for someone to deliver my message to Sibbi Black-Briar...
Looking for work? I need someone to deliver a message to Sibbi Black-Briar.
It is said that an Orc first learns to wield a hammer in her mother's womb.
By tradition, a mother always teaches her children how to smith. If a chief has a second wife, she is called the [QUOTE]Forge-wife[QUOTE] in honor of this.
It's a guild of Altmer thieves, they call themselves the Summerset Shadows.
Their leader, Linwe, he's the worst of the lot. He steals valuables from the dead.
Just round up the rest of the magical artifacts so that I can catalog them.
Keep your eyes open. I'm not sure what to expect when we enter the cistern.
Kesh could tell you more. I just want out of Skyrim as quickly as possible.
Returning to High Rock. Our shepherd lost his way, and I fear Peryite's wrath may consume those who remain with him.
Laelette? I thought she left to join the Stormcloaks. Ah! My poor Laelette!
I thought Laelette left to join the war. I hadn't heard from her since she left.
Likewise. Now, I have a lot to do, so I'm afraid you'll just have to leave!
Maybe you're not so soft, after all. Now you're ready for a real challenge.
The guardian spirits of Bear, Mammoth and Sabre Cat await you. Return when they are defeated.
Kyne's guardian troll awaits you. Complete this trial and you'll have proven yourself a true hunter.
I'll anoint you with the symbol of the Bear, the Sabrecat and the Mammoth. Tread carefully, these are mighty beasts.
No harm done. Tell this Endon fellow I hope he finds what he's looking for.
Nothing but a bunch of lowly bandits. Cowards, who will take little effort.
The Falmer. There have been reports that they've been attacking people at night.
It's a problem with the Forsworn. Unpredictable, unknowable, and dangerous. Be careful.
Rogue wizards. I've never trusted magic types. The College is bad enough. Destroy them.
The restless dead. Not pretty, but if you don't stop them, they'll move on to the locals.
Bloodsuckers. Vampires. Take every precaution. One bite, and you could end up as one of them.
Oddly enough, Spriggans. Usually they let alone, but for some reason, this particular grove isn't.
It's a clan of giants. The war is driving them out of their lands, and they've started attacking settlements.
You'll be clearing a nest of those Hagraven things. I've never faced one myself, but I hear... disturbing things about them.
Now that's a smart weapon. Light, strong, useful. Crack some skulls for me.
Oh, I am well. I will be well. Well to be within the will inside the walls.
Oh, I thought that matter was handled. I think Falk is taking care of that.
Oh, wow. I knew it. I knew they were real! I have to remember to tell papa.
Okay. All right. Wonderful. You're welcome! I'll just be on my way, then...
One thing's certain. I intend to find out before she draws her last breath.
Greed? Jealousy? Spite? Who can say what drove her to such an iniquitous act.
Our access to those bits of luck are what separates us from common bandits.
A pick breaking when it shouldn't have, the clouds in the nighttime sky clearing at the wrong moment...
Think about the Guild... about the state it was in when you began. Think about all the little things you might have heard.
So what's the plan, then? How do you intend to lure a dragon into the trap?
Then... Whiterun will stand with you, Dragonborn. We will take the risk, and gain the glory, whether it be in victory or defeat!
So you saw a dragon, did you? Tell me, what was it like? As big as a house?
So, the mage needs to be [QUOTE]taken care of,[QUOTE] if you understand me.
We have, of course, severed all ties with the mage in question, but the Jarl isn't appeased.
Some would say that all things must end, so that the next can come to pass.
Pruzah. As good a reason as any. There are many who feel as you do, although not all.
Perhaps this world is simply the Egg of the next kalpa? Lein vokiin? Would you stop the next world from being born?
Tell the people of Markarth that their dead are safe. My work is done here.
Very well. But should the hunger call out to you, I'll be waiting outside Reachcliff Cave.
Terrible shame, that. Seems we have a killer on the loose here in Windhelm.
He's claimed three victims that I know of, though maybe there's more that haven't been found yet.
All lovely young ladies, too. Let's hope the guards find that demon soon, and introduce him to the headsman's axe.
Thank you! I don't have much, but I can give you some coin for the trouble.
The goddess smiles at your efforts, child. The dawn shines bright upon you.
You have seen the young, fickle love of youth, and helped a more seasoned love find its way.
There is one final aspect we wish for you to explore. For a strong love can withstand storms and even survive death.
Take this symbol of Mara. She will guide you to the wandering souls of two whose love was so great that their entwinement binds them to this world.
The notion that the Nightingales are a fictive group has long since passed.
I think by now, most within the Guild are well aware of what transpired between Mercer Frey and ourselves.
If you wish to wear your Nightingale Armor within the Guild, I'm certain that no one would give it a second thought.
Then the die is cast, and once again my blade will taste Nightingale blood!
They are. Except the gem is always consumed. They're frail. Except for one.
This information needs to go straight to the steward. He'll listen to you.
Wuunferth. There have been rumors swirling about him for years. As long as I can remember.
But he's a dangerous man. It's why they call him [QUOTE]the Unliving.[QUOTE] I wouldn't approach him directly.
This isn't an order of cowards. I'll find someone more agreeable, I'm sure.
This work isn't for everyone. Maybe you're more cut out for those snowberries up in Winterhold.
Various shady types I've never seen before. I'd watch my back if I was you.
Dangerous-looking elves who didn't give their names. Draw your own conclusions.
We did this in the name of Mephala, whom I used to quite fervently worship.
We were an assassins guild that was sanctioned by the Empire to provide public as well as private executions.
We must hasten to Riften before Mercer can do any more damage to the Guild.
Well in that case. You'll have to hand over your life as well as your coin.
What about... wait. Are you? Were you the one the Greybeards were calling?
What have I done for the gods to take me so far from my beloved Daggerfall?
No. I'm a Breton from High Rock, and I refuse to be mistaken for a filthy native.
I don't care if we share the same ancestors, these people are savages. Half of them are Forsworn barbarians, and have you seen what they eat?
When you're ready, I'll keep the rest of your gear safe until you get back.
You'll only have what Malborn smuggled in for you, plus whatever you can pick up inside.
Wow, sure is nice of ya'. Here, hang on to the key and don't let anyone in!
Yes, I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is.
But I wonder... would you suffer an old man a few more words before the deed is done?
But of course. You and I have a date with destiny. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm?
Yes, yes! Did Arch-Mage Aren send you? He sent you to rescue me, didn't he?
You approach as if you know us, stranger. Who are you and what do you want?
You have returned with the gauntlets! Enter. Speak to our chief right away.
You might be able to learn something from it. Keep looking, but be careful.
Hmm. I can't say I've any idea what they were up to. Have you found this observatory?
You were helpful before. I have need of your help again, if you're willing.
You will enter my shrine, destroy Malkoran, and retrieve this mighty blade.
Mortals call it Dawnbreaker, for it was forged in a holy light that breaks upon my foes, burning away corruption and false life.
You'd do that for a stranger? I don't know what to say. Lead on, I suppose.
Your man Horik is wearing his old Legion armor. What should I make of that?
He's proud of his service, Skald. The Legion taught us loyalty. And we're loyal to Dawnstar.
This isn't over. I catch you sending one letter to General Tullius, I'll have you both executed.
Divines sake, Skald. Who do think we're threatening with our old war wounds? We're not soldiers, anymore.
Although now it looks like you'll be doing the sorting. Good luck with that.
Not enough to bother with it. Arch-Mage Aren's approach to these things is to just let them sort themselves out.
And I'm busy. You help me out, and I'll help you out. That's just how it is.
And I'm sure Barbas doesn't want me to have that axe. He'd want it this way.
And I could absorb the spirit of poor, dead Barbas. He'd still be reunited with me.
The choice is yours, friend. We're all counting on you to make the right decision. Put him out of our misery!
Be careful, lad. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to send you.
Be careful, lass. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to send you.
But it's hard to believe that even Balgruuf would choose Elisif over Ulfric.
I wouldn't say that. But he and Ulfric have been at odds for years, and I'm afraid Balgruuf will end up siding with the Empire because of it.
But we have a headquarters of a sort now. We'll rebuild the Blades. Someday.
The Thalmor hunted us down, remember? It wasn't exactly great for recruitment.
By calling the dragon with the Voice, he will hear you wherever he might be.
Ah, don't you see? The names of dragons are always three Words of Power -- Shouts.
Do some people look down on me? Have I made some enemies? You're damn right.
I'm a woman living in Skyrim with six children and no husband. I don't have the time or patience to be [QUOTE]nice.[QUOTE]
Grandson. He's a strong lad. His parents were at Helgen when, well you know.
Can't say I was a great father the first time around. Now that he's here it's like a second chance. He's a good lad.
Have you lost your mind? I thought it was clear I didn't want anyone killed.
Now I have to spend a fortune to keep the whole thing quiet. Guess where that money comes from.
He was once a student here at the College. Now he is... something different.
He's the protector of Man, the Dragon of the North, the patron of all Nords.
And despite the Imperials and their treaty, he will always be one of the Nine Divines.
A devout Nord would rather fall in battle and have his blood spill upon the earth than allow the Empire to strike his name from the divinity.
Help us get through this, will you? We're throwing everything we have at it.
Now's not the time. We need to put a stop to whatever it is that's going on.
Ancano has somehow locked himself in the hall. He's up to something, and I intend to put a stop to it.
Excellent. I'd suggest that we go retrieve it immediately, but right now we have more pressing matters.
His killing ushered in, shall we say, a necessary change in Imperial policy.
There are those now who wish for a similar change. I am sorry, but that's all I'm at liberty to say.
In the year 3E 41, Emperor Pelagius Septim was murdered in the Temple of the One in the Imperial City. Cut down by a Dark Brotherhood assassin.
His name's Bolund. He's the one who works the lumber mill down by the river.
If you meet him, don't expect much in the way o' conversation. He ain't one for talking, especially with folk he don't know.
Hmm. These doors seem to be the only thing left between me and the treasure.
Hmm... krosis. There is one... detail about Skuldafn I neglected to mention.
Aam? Serve you? ...no. Ni tiid. If and when you defeat Alduin, I will reconsider.
How are your parents faring, Grelka? Doing better than we are I would guess.
This civil war is taking its toll on all of us. Miners are some of the hardest hit.
That's what scares me. I'm afraid I'll travel to Darkwater Crossing and find it burned to the ground.
It's no feast in their neck of the woods either. Last time I was up there, father said they were barely scraping by.
I always had a feeling she liked me. More than that brute Jofthor, at least.
Jofthor... what about him? He'll come after us and... it will be unpleasant.
I don't. Go bother Kleppr at the Silver-Blood Inn, he handles the newcomers.
And by Ysmir, if you find work, just do what you're told. There's enough trouble in Markarth already.
I feared as much. I thought it was him we saw flying east after your battle.
I give them access to my business associates, and they keep my coffers full.
I made a lot of friends in a lot of ports, and the Thalmor approached me with a generous offer.
I've spent most of my life as a trader. I've got a stake in several shipping ventures across Tamriel, mostly imports and exports.
I guess all that's left is to bestow the title. What were those words again?
You've been a beacon of hope in these dark times for my people and I will never forget it.
Just remember that you're only a part of my court, this doesn't make you one of the family.
Doesn't matter... the title is yours. I henceforth name you Thane of Riften. Don't disappoint me.
I expect that you'll distance yourself from the affairs of state. In other words, keep your nose out of my business and we'll do just fine.
Therefore, by my authority as Jarl, I pronounce you Thane of Riften and award you all of the benefits befitting your station. Congratulations.
I should be the one thanking you. You've solved more problems in the short time you've been here then anyone in my court has their entire careers.
I hope you're just playing dumb. I'm the one who left the note in Ustengrav.
I only hope that this isn't an ending to things, but actually the beginning.
The Guild has welcomed me back with open arms. I feel like a void in my life has finally been filled.
I think there were twenty-four in all. Most people keep them as a curiosity.
Some of the Guild members have tried to locate them over the years, but they haven't been successful... well, until now.
I would be honored. Beyond honored to have such a thing here at the College.
This opens up entire new realms of research for us. Oh, if only Septimus were here to see this!
Thank you. Please, take this. It can't quite compare to an Elder Scroll, but still. You will be remembered for generations for this.
I'd constructed a meager shrine to Mara in the antechamber where we entered.
My intention was to spend the rest of my years here, burying the past and praying for forgiveness.
But instead, I wish to offer my services to you. If you ever wish to journey with me, I'll be here.
I'd give you a bow, but it looks like you've already taken it from the rack.
I'm going to put my neck on the line. We need people like you in our outfit.
Despite your mistakes, I see more potential in you than half the snot-nosed footpads that stumble their way into the Flagon.
Judging from how well you handled those shopkeepers, I'd say you've done more than simply prove yourself. We need people like you in our outfit.
I'm in the mood to ssssiiiiinnnggg! What about you, friend? Care to join me?
Is the line for my next performance starting already? Come on, don't be shy. Plenty of room for everyone.
If you desire a glimpse of our Dark Mistress, then this is what you must do.
First, prove your tongue can wield a lie. Find someone. Gain his trust. Lead him to the shrine above.
If your will is strong enough, it will stir Boethiah in her Dark Mansion, and she will appear before us.
Then, girded with certitude, plant the ceremonial blade deeply, so that the waters of his heart wash over you.
Next, instruct your thrall to touch the Pillar of Sacrifice. Its magic will ensnare him, rendering him helpless.
Is that so? I'll remember that next time we're in the mine tunnels... alone.
You wouldn't understand, Lash. Your people aren't smart enough for politics.
Why do your people claim the Reach is theirs? The Orcs have been in these lands just as long.
Did... did I say you weren't smart? I meant to say that I'm not smart, Lash. I'm just not smart enough to answer your questions.
It's got nothing to do with the coin... this is my life we're talking about.
Just like always -- nobody saw anything useful. The bastard's escaped again.
Maybe we can swap stories about our adventures over a mug of ale at the inn!
I can't thank you enough, friend. I'll hope you'll come back to Rorikstead soon and pay me a visit.
My brother is... sensitive. He has trouble focusing his attention on things.
This mine is only a few years old, but I've been digging up ore for over a century.
I write drama, friend. The legends and history of Skyrim made to excite and inspire.
Falkreath is known for its graveyard, traveler. We've buried more dead than you can imagine.
Sorry, I thought Skald the Elder sent you. We've got an order to fill, and he's not known for patience.
Could you deliver the ashes to Runil, the priest of Arkay? He'll know the right blessings to make for Berit's soul.
I've seen this before. We need some medicines to combat the ore dust. I was about to send a message to Windhelm for aid.
We're getting to the point where the tunnels are getting deep into the rock. People complain of bad coughs and foul air.
Look, if you're heading towards Dawnstar anytime soon, can you give the Jarl this note? Let him know he'll get his lumber.
Are you heading to Whiterun? Could you take this letter to the priestess, Danica Pure-Spring? It's a note about Joric's health.
My family has been doing it for years. You need one out in the Reach. Don't want to be alone when some Forsworn comes swinging.
I just finished giving my old war companion, Berit, a proper burial by fire. Old hard head hated the idea of being lost cold in the ground.
We were taking him to the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun, just so the healers could make sure he was in good health, and they say he's fine.
Poor Giruad Gemane at the Bards College has been waiting for my latest work, [QUOTE]Olaf and the Dragon,[QUOTE] for weeks now. Roads are a mess.
I personally trained a whole litter for the Jarl. That reminds me, I was going to deliver some dog food to the Keep. Spiced beef. Their favorite.
Next time you wish to accuse someone of a crime, I suggest you obtain proof!
Not intentionally. Some hoped he would be gone forever, forever lost. Meyye.
I knew better. Tiid bo amativ. Time flows ever onward. One day he would surface.
Which is why I have lived here. For thousands of mortal years I have waited. I knew where he would emerge but not when.
Nothing refreshes the soul like an honest day's labor in good, tilled earth.
It's remarkable that our farms are so prosperous given the harsh winters of late.
Looks like it's going to be a bountiful harvest once again. The gods continue to smile upon us.
Oh, Aventus Aretino. He was sent here when his mother died, but he ran away.
Aventus Aretino. He was sent to live here after his mother died. He escaped. And...
A little boy who lived here. Aventus Aretino. He was nice, but really quiet, and sad, because his mother just died.
Aventus Aretino? He only lived here for awhile. I think his mother got sick and died or something. Anyway, he's gone now. He ran away.
Before he left, he said he was going to do the Black Sacrament. You know, to call the Dark Brotherhood. So they'd come and kill old Grelod!
Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. He's really doing it!
But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and did some kind of dark ritual. He summoned killers to murder old Grelod. He's saved us all.
He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he was trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. Did he really do it?
He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he's trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. I really hope he does.
I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, and is trying to get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. That would be so wonderful.
I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, to try and get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. And... he actually pulled it off!
But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and is doing some kind of dark ritual. He's trying to summon some killers to come get old Grelod.
Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. Looks like he really did it!
Oh, he was a different person. Happy, outgoing... Like anyone who's in love.
Oh, the Hagraven feather and so on. You can throw all those out.  You see...
Please. Those savages are no match for us. The Jarl is just biding his time.
Biding his time until what? Until another person is lying dead in the streets? Don't be naive.
The Jarl is refusing to dispatch men to the front lines. Do you think it's because of the Forsworn threat?
Robbery is what it is. The Silver-Bloods are trying to muscle in on my land.
Forsworn attack the mines, and suddenly all these sellswords show up to [QUOTE]help.[QUOTE] They won't let anyone work until I sell it off.
The others do not speak. Their Voices are too powerful for you to withstand.
Tough luck for you then. Come back when you have at least one of the pieces.
Try putting your hands on the altar. Maybe Mehrunes Dagon will speak to you.
Good. You're here. I'll place the pieces on the altar, and Dagon should speak to us.
Let me put the pieces on the altar. We'll see if Mehrunes Dagon can still be reached.
Very well. I suppose I'll just curl up somewhere until this passes as usual.
We haven't caught anyone or anything yet. It's like it knows when I'm there.
If you can get to the bottom of this, the Priesthood of Arkay will reward you. Take my key, and be careful.
We've discovered that some of the dead have been... eaten. Flesh has been chewed off, bones were snapped to get at the marrow inside.
We've run into a rough patch lately, but it's nothing to be concerned about.
Tell you what. You keep making us coin and I'll worry about everything else. Fair enough?
Weeks? Longer? It feels like an age has gone by. I haven't slept in so long.
Well ain't that the truth of it. All right, then. Let's see what you've got!
Now wait a minute... No need to do anything drastic. Look, Keep the horse, all right? Then we all walk away happy...
Well. Anything to relieve the boredom. As long as it doesn't get back to me.
I don't think so. Sorry. I would love to help you, but Elenwen can be very vindictive. I wouldn't want to get on her bad side.
When Brynjolf brought you before me I could feel a sudden shift in the wind.
And at that moment, I knew it would end with one of us at the end of a blade.
When I was very young, I was sent to Skingrad in Cyrodiil to study with him.
He was a strange Altmer... paid more attention to his research than his own well-being. He lived in the basement of an inn for goodness sakes!
Whether you are the only Dragonborn of this age... that is not ours to know.
You are the only one that has been revealed thus far. That is all I can say.
You are not the first. There have been many of the Dragon Blood since Akatosh first bestowed that gift upon mortalkind.
Wonderful! I can begin to repay your generosity immediately. Say on, friend.
Wretched Dark Elves. It's just my luck I ended up working under one of them.
I don't know if I can stand the abuse here much longer. They treat us like outcasts.
The Dark Elves and the Wood Elves have never been the best of friends. Be patient, they'll come around soon enough!
Chin up, Ungrien! Remember, you have a roof over your head and food in your belly thanks to the very same Dark Elves. Be thankful.
You came to visit! It's so much better here with Grelod gone. Thanks to you.
You mentioned something like that... when you were running off with my goat!
Tell you what - you bring back my goat, and maybe I'll give a damn about your staff.
You will see them... wuth fadonne... my friends - Hakon, Gormlaith, Felldir.
Then you will feel - know - Dragonrend, in the power of its first expression.
Return it here, to the Tiid-Ahraan. Then... Kelle vomindok. Nothing is certain with such things...
But I believe the Scroll's bond with the Tiid-Ahraan will allow you a... a seeing, a vision of the moment of its creation.
You will. Until then, you'll taste every potion you make before you sell it.
There's just so much to memorize. How am I supposed to remember what goes where for every single herb?
No, no girl. It's the pickled spider tongue and then the decayed taproot. Do it the other way, and your cure turns into a poison.
You'll never be in charge of this family with that attitude, loving husband.
Did I hear correctly, Thonar? Is your brother really asking you to settle another dispute between Mulush and Nepos?
Someone has to keep the silver production running, Betrid, and that means keeping Mulush and Nepos in line once in a while.
The only thing I need to do, dear wife, is make sure profits are up, no matter what. If Thongvor won't do the dirty work, I will.
Humph. Who's running the Silver-Bloods? You or your brother? You need to tell Thongvor that he should settle this himself or step down.
You're going to have to buy him off; it's the only way to get his attention.
If that fails, follow him and see what he's up to. If I know Gulum-Ei, he's in way over his head and you'll be able to use it as leverage.
You've done alchemy a great service by helping to complete Sinderion's work.
I'd like to give you this tome...it's one of Sinderion's greatest works. I believe you've more than earned it.
Your path differs from most. You are being guided, pushed towards something.
No, though you may be the last. The one who calls himself Ancano has sought my knowledge as well, through very different questions.
It is a good path, one untraveled by many. It is a path that can save your College. I will tell you what you need to know to follow it further.
Ysmir's beard! The man was always a bit odd, but I wouldn't have expected...
I'm glad you were able to correct your mistake. I'll release Wuunferth immediately.
Actually, the fisherman who found me, the man I call my father gave it to me.
Thought it was fitting I suppose. I never changed it, because it never felt right to do so.
All right, but you just watch yourself. Next time, I might not be so lenient.
You're not sweet-talking your way out of this. Not after what you did. You're headed to Cidhna Mine, and that's that.
All right, that's far enough. You know how this works- toll here is 100 gold.
And finally, Sibbi; the worst of all of them. He's in Riften Jail for murder.
Then you have Hemming, Maven's son; spoiled brat and heir to her empire. He follows her word like a loyal dog follows its master.
Well, there's Ingun Black-Briar, Maven's daughter. Strange girl. She likes to spend time down in Elgrim's Elixirs working on her alchemy.
As for research... Well, a sufficient explanation will cover almost anything.
If you're going to need live test subjects for your experiments, it's easier to do that off of College grounds.
Purposely killing your fellow College members is a bad idea. I'd advise against it. Theft and assault can get you into trouble as well.
Barring any more interruptions, perhaps we can locate the information I need.
Besides, I'm sure your being imprisoned was all a terrible misunderstanding.
I suspect we might have use for someone resourceful like you. Not many survived Helgen.
But there is always more to learn. I believe you are ready for the next step.
You have gone beyond my teachings, which is quite a feat. I did not think it possible.
Come see me in Windhelm when all this is over, and I'll find a place for you.
I think you may have joined up with the wrong side, Dragonborn. You showed yourself a true son of Skyrim here today.
I think you may have joined up with the wrong side, Dragonborn. You showed yourself a true daughter of Skyrim here today.
The Empire showed its true colors today, eh? Don't worry. I was once loyal to the Empire, too, before my eyes were opened.
Didn't you just see that woman getting attacked in front of us? We're closed.
Even though the Phial was damaged, I still think your efforts deserve reward.
Now, if you'll pardon me, I'm going to tend to Nurelion. I can make his final days a bit less painful.
Fair? This is war, soldier. War's about winning, not being fair to the enemy.
Father never trusted Beem. I always thought he was just being overprotective.
Good. You're clearly better suited than I am to carry out such a menial task.
He is our leader. He surpasses us all in his mastery of the Way of the Voice.
He surrendered pretty meekly, too. So much for his death-or-glory reputation.
Ulfric ordered us to stop fighting. Didn't want us all to die for nothing, I guess.
I was assigned to Ulfric's guard. We were on our way to Darkwater Crossing, in the south of Eastmarch.
I thought we were taking Ulfric back to Cyrodiil, but I guess the General changed his mind. You know the rest.
This time, the General turned the tables on him. Ulfric rode right into our ambush with only a few bodyguards.
The Imperials were waiting for us. As pretty an ambush as I ever saw. We were outnumbered five to one, at least.
A masterstroke by General Tullius! He's only been in charge here for a few months, but he's turned things around for the Empire.
I thought they were taking us south to Cyrodiil. Parade us in front of the Emperor. But then we stopped in Helgen, and you know the rest.
We've been trying to catch Ulfric since the war started, but he always seemed to slip through our fingers... like he knew we were coming.
He turned to drinking, and what's left of him is what you see here every day.
One day, she just disappeared. Ranmir was convinced she'd run off with someone else, leaving him behind.
See, Ranmir was involved with a pretty young woman named Isabelle Rolaine. The two of them were very happy together, I thought.
I find that highly unlikely... but the court will love it. I'm writing it in.
I find that highly unlikely... I think it would be irresponsible to write that in to the verse.
I hadn't asked you because I was afraid you'd say no. I appreciate your help.
Here, I'm entrusting you with the dagger. Bring it to Andurs and he'll take care of the rest.
I have a... friend, let's say, who's interested in a staff. A particular one.
So, you bring that staff back here, and I'll consider it payment for the item Arniel was after.
The problem is that it'll be a little difficult to acquire, seeing as how it's in the hands of someone who isn't exactly friendly.
It's nothing dangerous, so don't worry. I'm not even sure why he wants it, but then that's not really my concern. He's willing to pay for it.
I know this place looks horrible -- please don't hold it against the Company.
I know! I know! I received the news not moments ago! Ha ha! This is glorious!
Ah, but you care little for politics, am I right? You want money! And money you shall have!
Your payment waits for you at a dead drop. It is inside an urn, in the very chamber where we first met, in Volunruud.
Now please, go. Collect your money, and let us never look upon one another again. Our business, thank the gods, is concluded.
My friend, you may not realize it, but you have served the Empire, indeed all of Tamriel, in ways you cannot possibly imagine.
I understand if you need some time to prepare. Let me know when you're ready.
I'll consider the offer, but I'll have to discuss it with the other caravans.
Yes, I've heard the Guild is rising back to power. An alliance would be most beneficial to both parties.
I'm warning you, when I get my heart set on something I'm not easily put off.
Mmm, yes... Brelas, is that the one? I hope you're not thinking of cutting me out, are you? Haha.
Innocent? So was I, for the first one. The other murders were all me, though.
It was my sister, Lilija. She served as a Battle Maiden with the Stormcloaks.
Anyway, I'm glad my work at the Black-Briar Meadery keeps me busy. Helps me keep my mind off of things.
We recently heard she'd been killed... I... I find it difficult to talk about. Perhaps you'd be better off speaking to my parents about it.
Just ask him where he was on the 30th of Frostfall. He'll know what it means.
Oh, and when you find Esbern... if you think I'm paranoid... you may have some trouble getting him to trust you.
Let's just say I'm a firm believer in an eye for an eye and leave it at that.
He fancied himself a thief in some sort of a new Guild forming around here. Gave me some valuable information before... well, you know.
Luckily, I had made some friends with the clan who immediately sided with me.
No, we usually let them go. I refused to do it, and Garthek ordered the clan to kill me as well.
We tore each other to pieces. After it was over, those of us that remained simply went our separate ways.
Markarth is my city. You have no right looking into my business. Now get out.
The guards know who holds the purse strings in this city, and I don't like snoops.
What did you expect? That no one was going to notice you butting into business that wasn't yours?
Me? I'm Burguk's brother. I came back after serving many years in the Legion.
By then, Burguk had already become chief, and he welcomed me home as family, not a rival as is tradition.
Men, women, children, no one was spared my wrath. I destroyed whole villages.
It was during the war with the Empire that I was at the height of my power. As a Thalmor battlemage I laid waste the enemy.
They are the governing council of the Aldmeri Dominion. They lead us to attack the Empire and forced the Empire to agree to stop worshiping Talos.
Now you're threatening me? What in the name of the Divines is wrong with you?
Of course you are! I prayed, and you came, and now you'll accept my contract!
Oh, no. Many were killed, of course. But many survived into historical times.
Why, this very palace was built by one of Balgruuf's ancestors to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name - Dragonsreach.
Oh, thank you so much! It's wonderful to have someone around who understands.
Oh... well... of course they'd disavow all knowledge... spies are everywhere.
I believe it should indicate how to enter the blocked off sections of the stronghold.
And for their bloody sacrifices, the Dragons gifted their priests with terrible power.
The research I've done seems to indicate that Skorm Snow-Strider left part of his journal here after laying siege.
Me? No, I'm too important to the war effort to risk life and limb in there... Besides, that's what I'm paying you for.
I should warn you, Forelhost is quite haunted, but I'm sure you can handle it. Return to me here once you've obtained the staff.
They were among the first men to arrive from Atmora and they worshipped certain animals as avatars of the Gods; Dragons being foremost.
It seems that after the strength of the Cult was broken in the Dragon War a last contingent came here to create a stronghold and regroup.
But their cruelty was too great for men to bear, and they rose up in what would be called the Dragon War and the Cult swept from the land.
King Harald's forces crushed stragglers here the during the First Era and it has been haunted ever since, but the specifics of the siege are unclear.
Paarthurnax? That name is familiar... the legendary leader of the Greybeards?
I would not have expected a scholar of such an esoteric turn of mind among their ranks.
Probably best if you avoid it for now... it didn't seem to do Reyda any good.
I've seen some sort of a cave entrance over there. Folks call it [QUOTE]Geirmund's Hall,[QUOTE] but I don't know why.
Sigrid! Love of my life! When you get a spare moment, I could use some water.
Don't you sweet talk me, Alvor. Not after last night. I'll bring you water when I'm done with my other chores.
Woman, you'll be the death of me yet. Fine, take your time. I'll just die of thirst in the heat of this forge.
So far he's managed to stay out of the war. I'm afraid it can't last, though.
Jarl Balgruuf? He rules Whiterun Hold. A good man, perhaps a bit over-cautious, but these are dangerous times.
Tarry not too long - the land of the dead is not meant for mortals to linger.
Tell you what. I'll give you a share right now if you forget the whole thing.
Oh... wait a second. I see what this is. You want me to cut you in or you'll rat me out to Brynjolf.
Why should I bother? I've already made a bunch of coin off of his shipment, so anything else I squeeze out of him would be a bonus.
That drum has been in half a dozen famous battles. It's a priceless artifact.
You're joking, right? Rjorn? Only the most famous battle drummer of the second age. Well, famous among bards at least.
Rjorn was always looking for new stories to tell. It seems he was writing a lay about Halldir when he vanished. That was the missing clue.
The effects have already been felt. The Icerunner has failed to dock on time.
My sister Deeja will be at the wreck with our Blackblood Marauders. She knows to expect you.
Without the Lighthouse, the Icerunner will have swung wide of the western shoal and run aground on the eastern coast.
This temple is dedicated to Mara, and the light of love she shines on us all.
I'm only a humble acolyte, though. If you wish to avail yourself of Mara's blessing, you should speak with Dinya Balu or Maramal.
Torygg had some martial training, of course, but it mattered little that day.
Had he not, Ulfric would have had cause to call a new moot and a new vote for High King.
By Nord custom, once the challenge was issued in court, Torygg had no choice but to accept.
When Ulfric's lips parted, when he unleashed the power of the Thu'um... That Shout, that ancient and terrible tongue... ripped Torygg asunder.
Ulfric and General Tullius are both just waiting for me to make a wrong move.
Do you think they will sit idle while a dragon is slaughtering my men and burning my city?
What do you think the Imperials would be doing while this dragon is busy slaughtering my men?
Do you think the Stormcloaks will sit idle while this dragon is slaughtering my men and burning down my city?
Wait a moment... do I detect a hint of genuine avarice from this noble thief?
Perhaps Karliah and Brynjolf misjudged you and your true nature is no different than my own.
Well, as you know, the Guild's growing and things are looking up around here.
The only thing we're lacking is a reliable way to transport our merchandise across Skyrim.
Well, yes. Two of them. But you're reaching the end of what I have available.
Kill these two, and I'll have one last contract to give you. I'm just finalizing some details now.
Your targets are a dark elf wizard named Maluril, in the dwarven ruin of Mzinchaleft. And Helvard, the housecarl of Falkreath.
Yeah, but don't say anything about it to Froki. I don't think he understands.
Yes. Congratulations, you are now a full-fledged member of the Bards College.
And finally, there's the matter of the Patronage that Elisif wanted me to give you.
What's more, Elisif has declared the Burning of King Olaf should become a weekly event.
Due to your adventurous nature several of the college professors have some things they wish you to do.
You merely transacted the Oath; signed the unwritten contract with Nocturnal.
In order for us to receive our abilities... our end of the bargain, I'm afraid the Key must be returned.
[QUOTE]...and unwavering obedience to the officers of his great Empire.[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]...even to my lord as to my fellow brothers and sisters in arms.[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]All hail the Stormcloaks, the true sons and daughters of Skyrim![QUOTE]
A word of warning though... I don't want any of them killed. Bad for business.
Honestly, the debt is secondary here. What's more important is that you get the message across that we aren't to be ignored.
After what you just experienced, you are not amazed? I am at a loss for words.
Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice, but it is written here in this scroll.
Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice like these worthy gentlemen, but it is written here in this scroll.
All I can tell you for now is that he's abused his authority as a Nightingale.
And I have no more time for talking. Go speak with Kesh if you are so curious.
And so you fulfilled your destiny, which you once said you did not believe in.
And take this. It's blessed with the old magicks. Something to remember me by.
I had Kaie recover all the things the Nords stole from you. You better get ready before we break out into the city.
Are you a sellsword? I don't like your kind. No honor. No loyalty. Unreliable.
But I can't turn away a potential ally in these times. Let's see if you're better than a common mercenary.
My scouts have tracked down one of the Forsworn leaders, hiding out in their blood-soaked camps. Deal with them.
At least you remembered to bring me the information I requested. Give me that.
The only thing keeping me from having you killed is Brynjolf. He's stepped in and made amends.
This doesn't tell me much. The only thing that could identify Sabjorn's partner is this odd little symbol.
Bandits harass the caravans at every step, but Khajiit usually scare them off.
By defeating Ulfric at Whiterun we have solidified the allegiance of the Jarl.
Perhaps the Stormcloaks will soon lose heart for this little rebellion of theirs once and for all.
Can you help me? He's in the tomb doing Gods know what with my dead relatives.
Come now, don't be shy. You haven't come this far just to stand there gawking.
Fair faces and fine food are well and good, but honesty is rarely so pleasing.
Fine. I offered you a reward. You'll get the freedom your kind enjoys so much.
But Boethiah's priest is imprisoned as well. But not by me. He is hurt. Suffering.
Save him. Let him perform his rites one more time. And when he does, I will be waiting for him.
Forgive me if I don't appear relieved... this temple has taken its toll on me.
Goldenglow Estate provided a huge payout for us before Aringoth locked us out.
Maven looked the other way as long as the honey kept flowing and we kept him in line.
Good luck on your travels. May Kynareth's wind carry only the sweetest scents.
Good. Kleppr will pay you as soon as you arrive with the letter. Here you are.
Good. Wait until I start the distraction and then show me what you're made of.
Haldyn? I've heard of the man, but never guess he'd join up with some pirates.
This could be even more dangerous than I thought. Head to the ships. We'll plan the assault on the way.
I am not. I have no more taste for Thalmor wine than I do for Thalmor company.
There's every chance I'll return to find a pile of smoking ash where Whiterun once stood.
What is more, I'm away from the hold at a time when there are dragons and Stormcloaks on the loose.
I am! I am! But not just my mother. Our mother, hmm? The Night Mother! Oh yes!
And you helped me! You helped poor Cicero! You talked to Loreius, got him to fix my wheel!
Ah, it doesn't matter. What's done is done, right? Cicero is here! As is the Night Mother! Joy of joys!
Oh, you may have pleased me, but you have surely pleased the Night Mother. And our mother, she will never forget.
But you disappeared! You were there... then you weren't! Did you mean to help poor Cicero or not? I'm left to wonder...
Oh, but you didn't help poor Cicero! You helped that stupid farmer! Stupid Loreius! Oh, the guard said cruel things about us. Untrue things...
I don't know what it's doing up there, but I'm not waiting around to find out!
I had a look at that boneyard the other day, Vantus. The one to the Northwest.
I told you I don't like you going there. I've seen scavengers picking at the mammoths. They could be dangerous.
I lead the Justiciars. We are charged with enforcing the ban on Talos worship.
Nords can be quite stubborn. They're slow to change their ways, and we find more heretics every day.
But mark me well -- I will purge the heresy from this land as surely as the flame burns the flesh from the bone.
I wanted to thank you again for the mince pie you sent over. It was delicious.
I'm sorry I lost myself for a moment there. I just need some time to get over the loss.
She watched while we ate it, and when she saw how much we loved it, she was... so proud...
I... I'm so sorry, Torbjorn. You must be suffering terribly. I wish there was some way I could help.
You've done more than enough already. You've been a good friend in a time of need, and we won't forget that.
It was my pleasure, Torbjorn. I enjoy cooking, and after what you and Tova have been through, it was the least I could do.
My little Friga loved to cook, but she was terrible at it. Then one day, out of nowhere, she made the most amazing leek soup.
I'll tell you why you won't tell me. Because you were absolutely right not to.
Since you're so well informed I'm certain you've solved the problem with thermic drift, right?
It's a fundamental rule of magic and it would be ridiculous. You can't draw from harmonic energy without a soul siphon.
I'm sure you've noticed that Winterhold isn't exactly overflowing with people.
So I'll sell whatever I can. If it's worth putting a price on, you can bet I'll do it.
I've known her long enough to appreciate her excellent taste in food and wine.
And also long enough to respect her importance to Skyrim. She plays a vital role in rooting out the forbidden worship of Talos.
As far as I'm concerned, those Talos-worshippers get what they deserve. All they do is cause problems for me and the other Jarls.
If you're in the area and you ever need anything fenced, you just let me know.
She's put me in charge of keeping the mead flowing, so that's exactly what I'm going to do.
Start changing it over to the Black-Briar Meadery West as soon as possible. That was Maven's part of the deal.
Isn't it obvious? Why, the wonderful weather and hospitable people, of course!
Not to mention my great fondness for dragons and petty political power struggles.
Ah, but without a doubt, the most compelling feature of this frozen wasteland is the volley of inane questions leveled at me on a regular basis.
New here too, eh? It's good to see another Nord. I feared I'd be the only one.
Almost doesn't feel like Skyrim, being so far away from the rest of the world here.
New here too, eh? I'd hoped I wouldn't be the only Nord, but I should've known better.
No. It's some sort of crazy contraption Mercer commissioned for quick escapes.
I'd wager a well-placed shot at the ramp's mechanism would lower it in a hurry.
Now we're deep in debt, penniless and about to lose our sole source of income.
My husband owns it, barely. He'll lose it soon enough. He's behind on his loan payments, but he drinks all his money away just the same.
Of course, I can't let you leave here alive. Wouldn't want anyone finding out.
Excellent work. You have a true fighting spirit. Did that better than I could have.
Of course! Nine is the most basic of magical principles. Oh, how stupid of me.
You've done it! Now, if I can only remember what we were originally talking about.
That completely takes care of all your basic problems, magicka burn, dimensional collapse and thermic drift!
Oh, I think I'll be fine. We seem to have eliminated the most pressing threat.
It certainly seems that whoever placed this here intended for it to be well guarded. I wonder why...
Recently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to Dawnstar.
The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and Arondil scribbling in his journals.
Sibbi and I were to be married. We were supposed to be happy together forever.
When I heard what Sibbi did, I fled. Now you've found me, and you're going to tell him where I am.
Then I found that wretched poetry from Svana. When I confronted Sibbi about it, he threatened to kill me.
I was scared so I told my brother Wulfur. He went to talk to Sibbi for me and... and... Sibbi killed him. My brother wasn't even armed!
Spirits! Ghosts! I am cursed, haunted, and I can do nothing. Can you fix that?
Of course you cannot. No one can. It is my lot as Chief of this tribe, and so I suffer quietly.
Survive, and you are worthy. This is the test put before you. Will you accept?
You will rely on your skill as a mage. Not on your belongings, not on your scrolls and potions. Only what lies within.
Thank you. He can be a bit difficult, but I'm sure he'll appreciate your help.
The master has gone but Dervenin will find him. Dervenin should not have gone.
Don't go to the Blue Palace. The master is on vacation. Don't listen to Dervenin. Don't do it.
Vacation is where the head is. That is what Dervenin told us about our master. He's cozy in his Solitude.
The second is to change Arn's name in the prison registry to his new identity.
The job is two-fold. First, steal a letter that was sent from Solitude warning Whiterun's guard to be on the lookout for Arn.
The timid warrior and the sly Khajiit. Must have been one or the other, right?
The blubbering barbarian and the tenacious mother. Must have been one of them, right?
Ah, the feisty goodwife. Quite the mouth on her. Someone must have wanted her dead... right?
The conniving Khajiit. Cat like that was sure to have enemies. It's no wonder you chose him.
Remember, the Sanctuary is in the southern Pine Forest. Just beneath the road, and away from prying eyes.
Oh ho. The whimpering Nord, eh? Yes, yes, I can see how you'd come to that conclusion. Interesting choice.
Hmm. The fearless wife and mother, and the underhanded Khajiit. Had to be one of them, right? Interesting choice.
Well, well. Aren't we the overachiever. Three possibilities, three victims. Must have been one of them, right? So why take chances...
Then the Forsworn will be where they belong. In the mines, bringing us wealth.
The Imperials were weak. They created this Forsworn problem, but now that we're in charge we'll solve it.
Once the war is over, I'll petition Ulfric to send the militia and we'll cleanse the Reach of this menace.
Then you're talking to the wrong man. You want that elf in the keep. Calcelmo.
The only thing I'll tell you about Markarth is stay out of our business. We have enough around here without some outsider causing trouble.
This circlet once proved invaluable to me. I hope it can be of use to you now.
Something as specific and ancient as the Staff of Magnus... I'm not sure we'd ever find something like that...
I seem to recall Mirabelle mentioning the staff somewhat recently. Why don't you see if she can tell you anything?
I'm quite pleased with your progress, you know. You've certainly proven yourself to be more than a mere Apprentice. Well done.
This council was your idea, eh? So tell us, what do you think Riften is worth?
Since we're all here at your request, I'd like to hear what you think Markarth is worth.
This is the only thing I've ever found. I think it's better off in your hands.
Over the years I've heard things. Powerful magics lost to the ages, incredible spells that only the most skilled mages can master.
Traitor? Me? Silly assassin. So confused, so confused... and they say I'm mad!
If I'm a traitor, so are you! Have you not heard the maiden's voice? Are you not the Listener?
So walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! A tiny white lie for a dark assassin!
We have a chance to destroy the Dark Brotherhood, forever. It's all up to you.
We tunneled into an old Nordic crypt. The whole place is crawling with draugr.
We're not mining up any ore with those undead around, so I wouldn't go down there if I were you.
Well, probably not like these. The ones in there are all still walking around.
Well, yes. This is rather embarrassing, but it seems I've misplaced something.
While I feel Ulfric's cause is just, my concern is for the people of The Rift.
How can they continue to lead their already meager lives with dark clouds looming overhead?
My heart goes out to them. If only our coffers were deeper, I could protect them as they were my own family.
Who in their right mind would be stupid enough to pay you to steal from Maven?
Whoa, lad. I'd do just as well drawing a blade across my own neck. Where did this foolish request come from?
Whoa, lass. I'd do just as well drawing a blade across my own neck. Where did this foolish request come from?
With a single snap of her fingers, we could have a legion here in a fortnight.
Defense? No one would dare attack Riften. I'm not sure you realize just how well connected Jarl Maven is with the Empire.
With all due respect, Arch-Mage, I'm not in a position to just give this away.
I told Arniel what I wanted in exchange for it, and he was unwilling to come up with it.
Now, if you're here on his behalf, I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist on my original payment.
You think you can do what he can't, and I'll sell it to you. Then you're free to run off to him with it, if you like.
You aren't fooling me. Trusted witnesses have seen you commit several murders.
And there are accounts of your suspicious behavior throughout the city. Now come quietly.
Good enough. I'll just confiscate any stolen goods you're carrying, then you're free to go.
Smart man. Now come along with us. We'll take any stolen goods, and you'll be free to go. After you pay the fine, of course.
Smart woman. Now come along with us. We'll take any stolen goods, and you'll be free to go. After you pay the fine, of course.
You'll pay off your debt to the Reach. Just work and you'll earn your freedom.
You won't. The Jarl has ordered a life sentence for you. Get comfortable in the dark, 'cause you'll never see the sun again.
You're the one who's coming to Japhet's Folly with us, right? You ready to go?
10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Prepared or not, I'm coming!
A fair point... Well, you've come to the right place, then. Speak with Galmar.
Ah yes. If she wants to pay the two thousand gold tariff than we'll be all set.
And any other abominations that prey on mortals. Vampires. Werewolves. Witches.
But the Daedra are the worst. Their callous disregard for our lives is abhorrent in the eyes of the God of Mercy.
And here comes my first visitor. The Museum of the Mythic Dawn is open, friend!
Aye, not so long ago. Some'll tell you I stepped down on account of my old age.
They named me Thane, and they got my nephew Siddgeir in my place. A real friend to Cyrodiil, that one.
Suddenly the nobles are calling for a new Jarl, and all the while their pockets are jingling with the sound of Imperial septims.
Truth is, I found out about all the Imperial spies crawling around Falkreath. A few well-placed bribes, and they bought themselves some friends.
Before I could even draw my blade, her second arrow found its mark in my chest.
When I arrived, Gallus stepped from the shadows. Before he uttered a sound an arrow pierced his throat.
Twenty-five years ago I was standing outside these very same ruins. Gallus told me to meet here but he wouldn't say why.
Finn was the bard who invented the eight course lute that is commonplace today.
Until he found a way to string the extra courses, bards only had six course lutes.
The lute they stole is Finn's original eight course lute. I doubt they even realize its true value.
Go forth. Do the biddings of Septimus, for he is working my will in your plane.
Good, you're back. Well, what did Mallory have to say? Is the amulet authentic?
Good. The whole point of being in hiding is to appear to be someone you're not.
Got stones in your ears? I asked what side you're on, Gray-Mane or Battle-Born!
Hasn't she told you? We were both Blades, back when that still meant something.
Now we're just fellow fugitives from the Thalmor. I didn't know she was still alive, but I'm not surprised. She was a survivor.
He never returned. From the journal you discovered, I'm sure you know the rest.
One day he simply ran out to me in the field, excited that he'd made some sort of a breakthrough and he was going to head out on another trip.
Hillevi Cruel-Sea comes in a lot, but I haven't seen her husband here in years.
Ulfric prays for strength. I speak to Captain Lonely-Gale, but he doesn't spend much time here. Too busy.
Like anyone, a crisis will push them towards devotion. I've been seeing a lot of the Shatter-Shields, since they lost their daughter.
However, this hardly matters any longer as you appear to have exited unscathed.
I thought I was clear regarding the dangers that awaited you within the Dreamstride.
I don't know you, and I don't sell what precious property we have to outsiders.
But if you're willing to work, and you prove to be reliable, I might deem you worthy to live here. My steward will handle things from there.
I had Markarth. My men and I drove the Nords out. We had won, or so we thought.
Retribution was swift. I was captured, quickly tried, and sentenced to death. But my execution never came.
And I have. Humiliating at first, but I knew he would let his guard down eventually. That he would come to trust I was under control.
Thonar Silver-Blood stopped it. He wanted the Forsworn at his call, that I would point their rage at his enemies and spare his allies.
I have been holding him here. While he regains strength, however, I am fading.
By now I can barely contain his power, much less defeat him if he awakens. But with the help of a living champion I may be able to succeed.
I spent years looking for what became of the ship, but I ended up empty-handed.
I learned that a matron who had served for House Telvanni had escaped Morrowind during the Accession War.
Records showed her buying passage aboard a sailing vessel named [QUOTE]The Pride of Tel Vos,[QUOTE] but that's where the trail ran cold.
I wish only an end to the fighting, so that I can tend to the temple once more.
When the wounded soldiers began to return from battle, I did what I could to help them.
Somewhat, yes. At first it seemed a distant thing, heard only in the idle speech of guards and traders.
As more of the sick and injured came to the temple, my work as a healer became more important than my duties as a priestess.
I... I... I don't know what to say. Such kindness is unheard of in these times.
Here. I want you to accept this as payment for your sacrifice and I... well, we both thank you.
I'm relieved to hear you say that. If you were to leave, I'd miss you terribly.
Riften has problems of its own. Now is not the time for exploration and discovery.
Aerin, I owe you my life. It would take a threat to all of Skyrim for me to depart.
You've been in Riften for quite some time now, Lady Mjoll. I fear that you soon may leave us.
I've got a message for you from Louis Letrush. This is for double crossing him.
I've thought about that... Trees like this never really die. They only slumber.
I think if we had some of the sap from the parent tree, we could wake up its child.
But even if you could get to the Eldergleam, you couldn't tap it. Not with any normal metal.
If Sabjorn ever managed to push Maven off her pedestal, we'd all be in trouble.
Let's not kid ourselves. Black-Briar Mead is swill. The only thing keeping it successful is Maven.
Word on the street was that Honningbrew tasted better, cost less and Sabjorn didn't shove it down everyone's throat.
If you can sneak into their camp and steal her plans, we'll have the advantage.
If you can sneak into their camp and steal his plans, we'll have the advantage.
If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time.
Rarely in my travels have I encountered those who possess skills equal to your own.
Yet here you are with my weapon that you could have easily sold or kept for yourself.
Astonishing. To think you actually were able to reach it and yet return to tell the tale.
Forgive me for my hasty opinion of you, I see that I was wrong and that there's much I can learn from you.
I see I still have much to learn. If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time.
When you told me of your intent to join the Thieves Guild, I honestly didn't think we'd have much to speak about ever again.
Imagine the heads of your enemies as you forge. Let your hatred work the steel.
In exchange, I'm willing to let a few ingots go missing. Maybe more than a few.
You could take word to her that there'll be a shipment soon. Buy us some time and keep her off our backs.
Indeed. One should find his death while he can still call himself a proper man.
To cling to something past its usefulness is unseemly, how much more so when that thing is you?
We Orc men are not like these Nords and Imperials who carry on until they are grey and feeble and their hair falls out.
It is said that the Phial will replenish whatever fluid is placed inside of it.
A legendary bottle, forged in the days when Skyrim was just starting its turn to ice.
A small container, made of the magically infused snow that first fell on the Throat of the World.
For an alchemist like myself, it is the most pure expression of my art. To create from nothingness is... poetry.
It means [QUOTE]Dwarven Museum.[QUOTE] Lost race of people that built the city.
You want to know more? Ask Calcelmo. He's usually in front of the ruins, just down the tunnel.
Like the Altmer? Yes, I would say their culture quite possibly rivaled our own.
Markarth is... different from the rest of Skyrim, there's no doubt about that.
The Reach has been part of Skyrim for a thousand years, but the Reachmen still haven't accepted it.
It was only 20 years back that the Reachmen rebelled. Even took control of Markarth itself for a time.
They were crushed, of course, but the survivors - the Forsworn - still lurk in the wilds and make the Reach dangerous for honest folk.
Next time one of my shields deflects a killing blow, they'll change their tune.
People say I'm making gold off of other people's misery, but what else would I do? Smithing is all I know.
Of course, leave an old man with a ruined dream. Just like everyone else. Fool.
Of course. You already saved Whiterun from that dragon. I owe you a great deal.
I'm sorry, but I can't do it. We'll just have to keep fighting the dragons as best we can.
But I don't understand. Why let a dragon into the heart of my city when we've been working so hard to keep them out?
Oh, and talk to Tonilia in the Flagon... she'll set you up with your new armor.
Simple. Do as you're told and keep your blade clean. We can't turn a profit by killing.
You should talk with Delvin Mallory and Vex. They know their way around this place and they'll be able to kick some extra jobs your way.
Oh, right, you were caught trying to cross the border into Skyrim, weren't you?
You're not kidding. Ulfric's the leader of the Stormcloaks - you know, the traitors trying to break Skyrim away from the Empire.
On moonlit nights or in darkened rooms, this agent literally becomes invisible.
The Agent of Stealth is the master of remaining unseen. They are able to manipulate the darkness and use it to their advantage.
Our ancient debt for Alduin's reprieve is now repaid - the long night is ended!
I'll look for you, friend, when at last you return to Shor's hall. The honor will be ours when you rejoin the ranks of Sovngarde.
Even here, where heroes throng, few can match this mighty deed. What glory! The gods themselves must envy us this well-earned honor!
Perhaps not as often as he should. In time, I believe he will be more trusting.
Redbelly is supposed to be nothing but an iron mine. Been working it for years.
I want to know what I'm dealing with before I start tearing it out of the ground.
Then right before the spiders had moved in, we found that chunk of ore. Never seen anything like it.
That is for you to discover. We can show you the Way, but not your destination.
That's none of your business and I appreciate if you wouldn't mention it again.
Blood from a stone, Klimmek. I've been out there every morning. They just aren't biting.
Come on, everyone in town knows that you spend more time with Fastred than fishing in the river.
We're behind again. I need you to catch another two bushels by week's end if I'm to make another delivery.
The Blades killed them all centuries ago. Nobody asks to hear that lay anymore.
There's the one about Tiber Septim and the dragon Nafaalilargus. I never bothered to learn it.
The blue thing? But even the simplest harmonic field is composed of entirely...
But wait. What about soul reversal? You must be aware of the consequences when using the apparatus near an open magic field.
Wait just a moment. The blue thing. Yes, yes, yes! I can see your point. Draw out the necessary energies using a Jarol Apparatus!
The Companions? In Jorrvaskr? They're recruiting new members, from what I hear.
The leader of the Dark Brotherhood? You mean Astrid? Dead? And this is no jest?
You, my friend. You've slain their leader. This honor should be yours. Do this, and you will be rewarded most handsomely!
Ha! This is a stroke of good fortune. Long have I watched the Dark Brotherhood's movements... waiting for the time to strike. That time is now!
My agents have recently acquired the passphrase to their Sanctuary. It is, [QUOTE]Silence, my brother.[QUOTE] Every assassin in that hole must be put down!
The strongholds keep to themselves. Skyrim hasn't always been kind to the Orcs.
The most well known stronghold is Dushnikh Yal. Here, I'll mark it down for you.
For an outsider like you to be accepted, an Orc would have to make you Blood-Kin, and send word to the chiefs.
There is no one else, but very well. I cannot force you to accept your destiny.
They are getting to be a problem. But I wasn't sent to Skyrim to fight dragons.
My job is to quell this rebellion, and I intend to do just that, dragons or no dragons.
They mean to take our history and crush it all in the name of some damn treaty.
I lost my own daughter to the Imperial dogs, and by Talos I'll not lose anyone else!
The Empire already took my daughter from us, but by Talos they will not take our homeland!
To suddenly have all that wrenched away is like losing someone you hold dearly in your heart.
Talos is part of our culture. He's part of our heritage and our tradition. He's Skyrim personified.
The soil beneath our feet is steeped in the blood of our ancestors. We've fought for this land and... died for it.
Those hill people who call themselves [QUOTE]the Forsworn[QUOTE] show no mercy.
I tell you this province is losing its grip. The bandits become more brazen every day.
Giants don't usually cause problems like this, but these ones are stirred up for some reason.
The rumors say the culprits are vampires. I try not to listen to swaggle like that, but figured you should know.
Some don't even believe they exist, but the Falmer can be devious. Tunneling into homes, stealing off with valuables.
Of course, it's a group of wizards they're pointing their fingers at. Who knows what they want it for, but we want it back.
Turned on the Empire first chance he got. Now we're all part of this rebellion.
Brina Merilis came in with the whole damn Legion and deposed Skald. Couldn't have happened to a better man.
That would be Skald the Elder. He's been running Dawnstar ever since he was a boy, and he never lost that brat's attitude.
Up for a little hunting? My husband is being a sad stick, so I can't go myself.
I may have accidentally let a prisoner escape. The leader of one of those bandit groups.
I was actually scouting a bit the other day, old times sake. Spied a brigand heading back to his camp.
Whenever a group of marauders attack a Nord village, Ulfric is the first to sound the horn and send the men.
That's right. Used to explore all over. I'm the one who originally found the mine Darkwater Crossing was built around.
I told everyone he died during questioning, and I need you to track him down and make sure he doesn't show up to disprove that.
But a group of Dark Elf refugees gets ambushed? A group of Argonians, or a Khajiit caravan? No troops. No investigation. Nothing.
There's a group of cutthroats out there right now that Ulfric doesn't lift a finger to bring to justice, as long as they don't threaten Nord land.
Walking the Steps. Meditating on the emblems. I make this trip every few years.
We hid from our past for years, became tradesman, people of coin and influence.
But I realized that the Mythic Dawn's importance -- our importance -- to history cannot be denied.
I'll see everyone in Tamriel remember that for a moment, we held the fate of the world in our hands, for good or ill.
It's no secret that my family were once members of the Mythic Dawn. One of my forefathers was even chosen to assassinate Uriel Septim himself.
Well, well, you actually did what you said you were going to do. I'm impressed.
Here, let me teach you a thing or two about Alteration magic. It's the least I can do.
Well, well... color me impressed, lad. I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!
Well, well... color me impressed, lass. I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!
Well, you could always speak to Delvin or Vex if you're looking for extra work.
I also suggest you spend some time in the trainin' room. Just talk to Vipir. He'll show you around.
If you're ever in need of some quick coin for items you find on the job, Tonilia is the best fence around.
Treat her right and she'll make you rich. Try and rip her off and you'll have the whole Guild to answer to.
Also, I recommend hitting the training room if you need lockpick practice. Helped me out of a jam more than once.
If talking your way out of trouble isn't enough, you could always pick up some training from Delvin, Vex or Vipir.
I'll point you to the first and last person you're ever going to need to talk to. Tonilia. She's the Guild's fence.
And besides myself, Delvin, Niruin and Vipir can help you with any sort of training you might need to sharpen your skills.
Or if you're looking for training, we've got plenty of it down here. Delvin, Vex, Niruin and Vipir can give you a leg up on that.
If you're lookin' to get some coin for the fruits of your labor, you should talk to Tonilia. She sounds tough, but she'll cut you a fair deal.
What would you have me do, woman? Cross the Guild? Take them all on one by one?
You know I don't mean that. We need to find a way out of this. Perhaps talk to Laila...
You keep giving and giving Bersi, and they'll keep taking and taking. When is it going to end?
Laila is as clueless as she is stupid. No. If anything's to be done about this, we have to deal with it ourselves.
What? I'm not even... ah, I see. You have some knowledge of the alchemical art.
When your Voice can open the path, you will know you are ready to speak to him.
Five. Our leader, Paarthurnax, lives alone on the peak of the Throat of the World.
Wonderful. I'll use it to repair the tree. Thank you so much for all your help.
But... I can't run the Temple without the support of people who are inspired by the Gildergreen. How can this little tree bring new worshippers?
You know about Helgen? The Jarl will want to speak to you personally. Approach.
You must find out how he does this, before he regains his strength and returns.
The old tales say that he can travel into Sovngarde to devour the souls of the dead.
Haven't you been listening to me? All the old tales agree that he has some means to travel to Sovngarde itself.
There he devours the souls of the heroic dead to feed his power. You must find his portal to Sovngarde before he returns, stronger than ever.
You see, my name is Barbas. And I have a problem I think you can help sort out.
You're back. Good. All right, so? Did you meet this Motierre? What did he want?
A most impressive attitude. Keep this up, and you'll do quite well for yourself.
Ah, I see. The old Dark Brotherhood [QUOTE]silent intimidation[QUOTE] treatment.
Oh, I know who you are. Don't be so surprised. You ain't the first assassin sent to kill me. Won't be the last. Now let's get this over with.
All you need to do is ask and we can both come out of this smellin' like a rose.
That's where you come in. I've got plenty of work available that could guide us down the road to recovery.
I'll tell you what we do. We spit in that curse's face and turn things around down here. Put things back the way they were.
Among ourselves, of course. Mu ni meyye. None were yet ready to openly defy him.
Many of us have begun to question Alduin's lordship, whether his Thu'um was truly the strongest.
Rinik vazah. An apt phrase. Alduin bovul. One reason I came to your call was to test your Thu'um for myself.
And then there's Borvir and Rundi. Twins, though they rarely agreed on anything.
As I recall, Yisra was trying to improve flame cloak spells to better work in Skyrim's harsh environment.
Those two boys were obsessed with mead. Convinced they could concoct something to compete with Honningbrew.
Ilas-tei was practicing Illusions spells. She was having trouble with the calm spells, I believe, but only ever worked with skeevers.
Something about using frost magic to chill the mead for a certain period of time. I felt it was a waste, but the Arch-Mage let them proceed.
As I said, you will know you are ready when your Voice can open the path to him.
Aye, Dragonborn. Maybe you can stop the dragons - and this war into the bargain.
Before we enter, I must warn you about the dangers that could be lurking within.
Years ago, this temple was raided by an orc war party seeking revenge... they were being plagued by nightmares just like the people of Dawnstar.
But I also enjoy learning the latest gossip and hear the most intriguing rumors.
Quite often, yes. The only thing I enjoy more than luxury is sharing that luxury with those who can appreciate it.
But they did not trust us. Ni ov. Their inner councils were kept hidden from us.
I was far from here on the day of Alduin's downfall. But all dov felt the... sundering of Time itself.
Yes. There were a few of us that rebelled against Alduin's thur... his tyranny. We aided the humans in his overthrow.
Do you know the College of Winterhold? They have a deep interest in such arcana.
Every day the threat of exile from Riften draws closer for myself and my family.
Who knows how many spies the Empire has sent into our midst already. We're at war. This isn't the time for hospitality.
Thank goodness mother is keeping a level head about everything. If my brother Saerlund had his way, we'd be flying Imperial colors by now.
Every moment you waste is another moment those doors stay shut tight. Get going!
Friga Shatter-Shield's old place? It's been abandoned ever since she was killed.
He treats me like a slave... I have to do every nasty, dirty job in the meadery.
I made the mistake of borrowing coin from Sabjorn. He's allowing me to pay it back, but he's working my fingers to the bone!
He's been in Kynesgrove forever. Great storyteller. Keeps everyone's spirits up.
Too many drinking games, too many bets, and I'm too old to ever raise the coin on my own.
He's a damn tyrant. Always being goaded on by the Silver-Bloods to get more work out of us.
That bard Mikael is begging for a dagger up against his throat, the way he goes on about me.
He owes this tavern enough coin to burn it down, build it back up, then burn it down again just for laughs.
Torbjorn Shatter-Shield. I wish someone would beat the coin out of his fat fists. He clings to every Septim.
Owes me a lot of coin for drinks. I keep telling him not to worry about it, but he's got the stubborn Nord blood.
He says an Argonian's labor is only worth a tenth of a [QUOTE]proper Nord worker.[QUOTE] My people are not slaves!
He's had some troubles in his life, but I can't have him drinking here without at least paying back some of the coin he owes.
I've heard him boasting at the Bannered Mare, saying he'll [QUOTE]conquer me as a true Nord conquers any harsh beast.[QUOTE] Hmph.
They pay us next to nothing. We get beaten if we make a mistake, and where are our kind Nord rulers? What are they doing? Typical.
Damn fool doesn't have the coin to pay me back, so he just beats himself up over it, and then he gets thirsty, and it cycles all over again.
However, ever since that day, I've felt my power waning... slowly draining away.
My spirit didn't manifest itself in the Sepulcher immediately, so fortunately I wasn't present when the Ebonmere was sealed.
I know, I know... Wars to fight, dragons to confront, guild business to conduct.
I think it very likely that he will be unable to resist investigating your call.
He's not compelled to, but dragons are prideful by nature and loath to refuse a challenge.
Your Voice in particular is likely to intrigue this dragon, after your victory over Alduin.
I want to thank you for your help. I know my master can be a bit short at times.
I'm not sure what just happened but I assure you I will get to the bottom of it.
If you can bring it back, we could restore the paragon... and reap its benefits.
I have it on good authority that the crown is within Tolvald's Cave; dropped by a Dunmer caravan leaving Morrowind long ago.
If you're not afraid of little exploring, I'll pay good gold to get those salts.
Sailors are what happened to them. They got drunk and ended up losing the merchandise in some cave.
If you're still breathing in a few weeks, I'm sure we'll be the best of friends.
Save the niceties for now. I have no intention of getting invested in someone who may be dead tomorrow.
Is that so? Well then, I'll have to charge you with disturbing the Jarl's peace.
It is called [QUOTE]Dragonrend[QUOTE], but its Words of Power are unknown to us.
We do not regret this loss. Dragonrend holds no place within the Way of the Voice.
Lyin' to my face isn't gonna win you any favors with me, I can promise you that.
On the other hand, takin' some of these extra jobs off my hands, now that'll get you to the top of my list.
Madesi, have you heard the Imperials might be headed this way? What would we do?
But I've heard from the Snow-Shods that they intend to burn this place to the ground!
Tythis, please. The Snow-Shods are good people, but tend to exaggerate. Try and stay calm for your own sake.
They aren't invading, milord... it's simply a response to Ulfric and his Stormcloaks. I assure you everything will be fine.
Maybe we could invite some of those nice guards over. You know, for some supper?
No. I have enough trouble without more mouths to feed! They're the Jarl's men, they can eat supper at the keep.
My brother told me you were coming. I'm supposed to give you what you've earned.
My pa used to say there ain't no use worryin' about the things you can't change.
If it's my fate to be ended by a dragon, so be it. Meantime, I'll live my life the way I want to.
Nepos the Nose handles that part of our business. He has a way with the workers.
All the miners, farmers, and laborers in the Reach get their daily wages through us.
For one, the landowners of the Reach. It goes without saying that they rely heavily on us for our silver and support.
No, no, of course not. Forgive me, Dragonborn. I have been intemperate with you.
But heed my warning - the Blades may say they serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have.
No, you're right. After all this time, Ulfric still holds almost half of Skyrim.
Well... we could use some breathing space to regroup. Things haven't been going well for us lately.
Fair enough. We're driving the Stormcloaks back well enough at the moment, but we're already overstretched.
Not to mention the rebels completely control Windhelm and all of Eastmarch hold.
My Jarl, we need to discuss the state of Markarth's collapsing trade with the other holds.
Of course there's a collapse in trade, Raerek. The Stormcloaks stalk every road and harass every one of our patrols.
Why do you pester me with battles we can't win? I need my steward to plan for our victory, not nag me with every ill account.
Very well. I'll send a request for additional Legionnaires to protect trade to the other Imperial holds. Hopefully Solitude can spare more men.
Forgive me for worrying about the future of Markarth. The lifeblood of a city is gold, Igmund, and it doesn't stop bleeding because there's a war on.
Oh, I'd get in trouble for that. It's not allowed. Besides, it's scary in there!
Ghost or not, there are reminders of his dark rule that are best left buried away.
Not on your life. It's dangerous in there, and Falk doesn't even like me and Erdi going in every year to clean out the spiders.
Absolutely not. That wing has been sealed for hundreds of years, and for good reason. They say the ghost of Pelagius the Mad still haunts it.
Oh, merciful Arkay, no! I am too old and frail, and this graveyard is too large.
Kust is my assistant. He helps me tend the headstones and keep our cemetery clean, as befits a place of rest.
One of the mages there may be able to put you on the trail of this Elder Scroll.
Perhaps the College of Winterhold. What learning there is in Skyrim is gathered there.
Ah, indeed? There's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. Let me think...
Ah, indeed. Well there's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. I'm sure you'll manage, though.
Pah. The gods have a place for killers. You can't carry the burden? You're weak.
Persistent aren't you? Oh, very well. Who am I to stand in the way of curiosity?
Correct. It's a private place where I can catalog my research. Occasionally, the Jarl will come in and have questions, but that's thankfully rare.
Please, I'm desperate. This is my brother's life! I won't let them take it away!
I beg of you, look for proof of Thorald's capture. The Battle-Borns have it, I just know it.
Rjorn's drum! Nobody knows where he died, and therefore where his drum might be.
Halldir was the missing link. Rjorn entered Halldir's Cairn in secret, and presumably died there.
Now all I need to do is find someone to get it. Wait. You. You could do it. I need you to get me that drum.
Shor's favor has found you, Dragonborn. The Hall of Valor, heart's-ease, awaits.
Shout for Odahviing from the Dragonsreach courtyard. After that, it's up to you.
Interesting problem. Hmm. Yes. I've been poring over the records here in Sky Haven Temple.
Sigh... I'm not proud of it. I'm terrified of that place and Aunt Agna knows it.
My Da locked me in there in a drunken rage when he left us... three days in there eating the offerings left for our dead before Aunt Agna found me.
So be it. I'm sure Arkay will find it in his heart to forgive you... eventually.
So I gave her some advice, pointed her towards Hobs Fall Cave and that was that.
I told her it was a bad idea, that she wasn't cut out for what'd be necessary, but she wouldn't hear it.
She came through a while ago, wanted to know where she could get her hands on something valuable. Anything, really.
Sorry. I thought I saw a fellow running away, but didn't get a good look at him.
Speak with Galmar. He'll size you up and see where we can best use your talents.
If you know any true sons and daughters of Skyrim, tell them to head to Windhelm. Ulfric Stormcloak wants to see them.
That's quite a noble sentiment for someone in our... well, in your line of work.
The Guild has a lot riding on this. Don't make me look foolish by mucking it up.
Maven prefers that Aringoth remains alive, but if he tries to stop you from getting the job done, kill him.
The Jarl has recognized you as a person of great importance in the hold. A hero.
The title of Thane is an honor, a gift for your service. Guards will know to look the other way, if you tell them who you are.
There's no mistake. You're a wanted man... and it's time to pay for your crimes.
There's no mistake. You're a wanted woman... and it's time to pay for your crimes.
You're the one who conspired with the Forsworn against Markarth! You're coming with me, murderer!
The only mistake was you showing your face. You've committed crimes against Skyrim and her people, and it's time to face the Jarl's justice.
These old ruins... They don't want us here, the ancient ones. Better left alone.
Was I correct in hearing that you were traveling to the grove of the Eldergleam?
Well, as it turns out, I had a pet skeever when I was a boy and he used to wink.
Well, there are three of them. Arranged in three tiers, as you may have noticed.
Most of the city's residents live in the Wind District, which is the middle of the three.
Dragonsreach occupies the highest, which we call the Cloud District. From here, the Jarl can see all that goes on within his city.
The Plains District is so named because it's the closest of the three to the plains that surround the city. The inn and marketplace are found there.
What? I never even cast... ah, I see. You have some knowledge of the Higher Art.
Who are you? Why are you here? Leave this place. I have much work to conduct....
With open arms, with cheers and song, with joy in my heart and tears in my eyes!
Praise be to Talos, this is a glorious day for Whiterun and for all Skyrim! Our liberators have come at last!
You don't seem to realize there's a war on. What you are is a damn Imperial spy!
You have talent. Keep working at your craft, and you'll be a fine smith one day.
Why don't you keep that dagger and helmet? Maybe you'll remember me when you're making Skyforge Steel, huh?
You know what? You're not worth the hassle. Go... be some other guard's problem.
Well, your bounty is low... All right, get out of my sight. But you're known to me now, scum. Remember that.
You'd do well to remember that the next time you make such a stupid observation.
Of course. Nothing gets done without my approval in this city. I have the Jarl's ear, and the guards in my pocket.
Anyone makes trouble for me and I pay a visit to the Thieves Guild. Make me angry and I contact the Dark Brotherhood.
You'll also need to decide whether to devote yourself to a single type of spell.
Certainly. Destruction spells come in different forms, each useful for various purposes.
Concentration spells can be cast immediately, though they're weaker. Good for a tight spot, and less costly if you miss.
Focusing solely on flame spells will make them more powerful, but you may find yourself at a disadvantage against foes immune to fire.
You're Dragonborn, and you're the only one who can stop Alduin. Don't forget it.
Good. The Greybeards can teach you a lot, but don't let them turn you away from your destiny.
You've made Narfi so happy! Narfi now waits for his sister until she comes home.
A day goes by without someone trying to gut me in the street, I get disappointed.
He he he he he he he. The real question is, [QUOTE]Would someone pay to have me killed... again.[QUOTE]
Ah, Moon Sugar. I could smell it on you. I'm pleased with this offer, and accept.
Take my word to the leaders of your guild and tell them we look forward to a prosperous and profitable future.
If you happen upon any of our caravans in your travels, we'd also be more than willing to pay you a fair sum for any of your stolen goods.
Ah! It's been too long since last I faced a doom-driven hero of the dragon blood.
And you did just that! I haven't been so entertained in at least a hundred years.
I really just needed something to encourage you to go out into the world and spread merriment.
At least Sabjorn has found himself in Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.
Word on the street is that poor Sabjorn has found himself in Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.
I warned you not to cross Maven. If I hadn't stepped in and paid amends, you'd be... well, I think you know.
Been a long time since someone took the leap. Longer still since any survived it.
I once performed the entirety of the Poetic Edda from atop Bard's Leap before trying my luck... Well, you can see how that turned out.
Changed your mind? You ready to pledge your blood and honor for Skyrim's freedom?
Excuse me, but do you know anything about this house? Seen anyone enter or leave?
Fine, but I've locked the door so don't think you're getting in there without me.
For what it's costing me, I should be handed the merchandise on a silver platter.
My agents are telling me that we've appropriated the caravan from Hammerfell... with minimal losses.
The coin isn't just for the men, there's a lot of people that need to be compensated in order to make this happen.
And a hefty cut for yourself too I'm sure. Just see to it the items are secured and the rest disposed of properly this time.
Fortunately, they seem to be sticking to the barrow. I think they're guarding it.
Certainly isn't helping my business any; who'd want to rent a room anywhere near a haunted barrow?
Good. Wipe them out. So long as one of them is left alive, they will come for me!
Great. Get back to me when you're done and I'll give you something for your time.
Ha! I'll see to it the Jarl hears of your abuse of a court scholar. Shame on you.
Hold on, there. I suppose, in the uh, interest of research... I can spare a few more coins. Double and a half its value. That's all I can muster.
He just keeps to himself in what's left of his folk's farmhouse across the river.
He's harmless. He's been in a state ever since his sister Reyda disappeared over a year ago.
He was a great war leader of the ancient Nords, a master of the Voice, or Tongue.
Jurgen Windcaller's mastery of the Voice eventually overcame all opposition, and the Way of the Voice was born.
He finally came to realize that the gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Voice.
He was the first to understand that the Voice should be used solely for the glory and worship of the gods, not the glory of men.
After the disaster at Red Mountain, where the Nord army was annihilated, he spent many years pondering the meaning of that terrible defeat.
Hmm? Oh, sorry. My mind wanders sometimes. I was just thinking about Finn's Lute.
But they also stole Finn's Lute. We just learned where the bandits fled to, and I very much want that lute back.
Over a year ago, thieves broke into the college and made off with a lot of valuable things. Mostly gold and silver.
I am pleased, mortal. I will give you my Razor. Use it to wreak havoc on Tamriel.
I can only give you my word as a priest of Mara that my intentions are honorable.
Your concerns are understandable; trust is a very difficult commodity to come by these days.
I did ask. Although I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're really on. Still...
Fair enough. Although I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're really on. Still...
Fair enough. You claim to be neutral, but it seems that you actually favor the Empire. Still...
Fair enough. I thought you might be able to see past your Imperial loyalties in the interests of peace, but I guess not. Still...
Fair enough. I was hoping you could put aside your loyalties for the greater good, but I see you're firmly in Ulfric's camp. Still...
I don't care what Beem says. It's high time we get in there and find our fortune.
We should be inside, loading up on treasure. Worry-scales here thinks we should wait, though. Don't get any ideas, either. We were here first.
I sell cases of it for half of what the inns and taverns pay through the Meadery.
All I need is someone to deliver it for me. If anyone saw me leave Riften, they'd get suspicious.
No, no friend. You've got it all wrong. I'm not selling cheap mead. I'm selling good mead for cheap... Black-Briar Mead.
I've been burned a few times, made a few bad deals, but mostly I come out on top.
If you want to call it that, yes. Me? I think she was softening him for the kill.
Gallus would call her his [QUOTE]little nightingale.[QUOTE] He was absolutely smitten by her.
It worked, but not fully. And the uhh... The device was destroyed in the process.
I attempted to build my own, based on designs and using parts you helped to provide. My very own Dwarven Convector.
The soul gem by itself isn't enough, you see. It needs to be altered, purified. The dwarves had machines for this sort of thing.
Well, yes. I mean, no. That is, it might, but I'm not completely sure. I'm no tonal architect, I've only read their writings. Scraps, really.
It's difficult to explain to the layman -- forgive me if I begin waxing alchemic.
The nearest modern incarnation of it is the strange rituals practiced by the Forsworn.
With the heart of one of their Briar Warriors, I can lock the Phial's magic into its physical form.
The final tempering of the Phial was performed with a type of old magic that's been lost since the Dragon War.
Join the forces mustering at the [CAPITAL] (infos conditions on location go here)
Kreh zini! The freedom of the sky beckons! Yet I stay here, nau gol, as promised.
Mark my words. Thonar Silver-Blood was behind that attack in the market. Somehow.
I'm one of General Tullius's agents. I was sent to investigate the Treasury House and the Silver-Blood family.
They own Cidhna Mine, one of the toughest jails in Skyrim. I was hoping I could buy or steal the deed, but I don't think that's how things work here.
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. I can't be expected to remember every deal I handle.
Mind you, it's no business of mine what each Companion does in the name of honor.
But this sneaking around. It doesn't befit warriors of your standing. Aela knows better, and so should you.
No... no, that is all. Now... now please. I find myself very weary all of sudden.
Now go. And give the city of Solitude a celebration they're not likely to forget.
Your target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
Vici is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus.
Now? You could use it for what we meant it for. Using black souls for enchanting.
The Black Star will never decay, but it can no longer hold the white souls of lesser creatures.
You keep it. I'd sooner finally put this chapter of my life behind me. Congratulations. You've changed the fate of a Daedric artifact and lived.
Thank you for your help. I will make my home here, away from anyone I might hurt.
Thank you. You've done a good thing for me and my workers. Here. This is for you.
That won't be the last we hear from the Silver-Bloods, but at least we can get back to work.
Thanks so much. I'll return to temple. Here's something for your time and effort.
The Blades have always guarded and guided the Dragonborn. But we'd forgotten why.
Now our purpose is clear. I'm all that's left of the Blades, and you're the Dragonborn.
Dragons are coming back, and you're a born dragonslayer. That's all you need to know right now.
Together we're going to stop these dragons, if we have to put every last one of them back in the ground.
The Bunkhouse is for the working man, not some sort of a luxury inn for tourists.
This heap of matchsticks is what everyone calls Haelga's Bunkhouse. Can you stay here? No.
There's plenty of gold out there for the taking... if you're up to the challenge.
Bah. My organization's been having a run of bad luck, but I suppose that's just how it goes.
But never mind that, even though you fouled up the job I still think you've got that spark I'm looking for.
But never mind that, you did the job and you did it well. Best of all, there's more where that came from... if you think you can handle it.
They say Falion of Morthal has studied vampires, draugr and all matter of undead.
Ugh. Erikur, right? He was talking to me earlier. I could tell what he was after.
I hate working these parties. Some of the guests are nice, but there's always a few like Erikur.
Please tell him to leave me alone. Politely. I'm sure you'll have better luck getting through to him than I would.
Under the authority of Mara, the Divine of Love, I declare this couple to be wed.
I present the two of you with these matching rings, blessed by Mara's divine grace. May they protect each of you in your new life together.
We choose our battles, and you've chosen yours. Someone else can take care of it.
We're not. The Silver-Bloods pay our wage. Every man here is a trained mercenary.
Well. They've been hunting down Blades since the Great War, on general principle.
I don't suppose they want the world to end any more than we do. Or at least, they'd prefer to end it on their terms.
But if you mean me, now, in particular... maybe they've started to get an inkling of what the return of the dragons means.
What?! No, that's not me. I'm not Esbern. I don't know what you're talking about.
What's the meaning of this interruption? Jarl Balgruuf is not receiving visitors.
When I met Michel, I knew this was where I belonged. I suppose that's it, really.
Logrolf rescued me and gave me enough money to get out of the city. I followed the Karth river north, and came here.
I grew up an orphan on the streets of Markarth. I'd have died there, too, but for the kindness of an old warrior named Logrolf the Bent.
Worse still, he uses the power stored within my own token to fuel his foul deeds.
Guide my light through the temple to open the inner sanctum and destroy the defiler.
I have brought you here, mortal, to be my champion. You will enter my temple, retrieve my artifact, and destroy the defiler.
The Necromancer Malkoran defiles my shrine with vile corruptions, trapping lost souls left in the wake of this war to do his bidding.
Yes. Yes, fine, I'll come to this Greybeard council. For all the good it will do.
You can't scare me with your tough talk. I'm not paying you people a single coin.
And so have I. What's the point of paying anyway? Your outfit can't even fend for itself. I could do better tossing the gold into the sewer.
You must bring it to Avanchnzel, in the west. Return it to them. It must go back.
You think I'd be in hiding if this was something I trusted town guards to handle?
Guards and Jarls can be bought. And the Alik'r are close; I'm running out of time, so I'm choosing to trust you.
These men are ruthless. Cunning, deceitful... they'll pay off whoever they can. I can't trust anyone here in Whiterun.
You were guided here; you were always meant to be here. That's the way of things.
Then I thank Lady Mara with all my heart; for you, for our child and for our love.
And to think I was wandering the ash wastes only two years ago. I never knew my path would lead to you.
It fills me with joy to hear you're with child, Dinya. They said it wouldn't... that it couldn't happen, but Mara has shown them they're mistake.
You'd better give me five septims, right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose...
You'll be helping out an old beggar, and the Divines smile on that sort of thing.
Well let's not put it like that. Wouldn't want the Thieves Guild catching wind of us, eh?
Nah, just creep in and have a go at taking it out. I'll be here, and pay you half of what my man in Riften promised for it.
You've got that right. Only a matter of time before we're roasted alive. Come on!
Your funeral. Someone else is gonna have to help you get him back in there again.
[QUOTE]As Talos is my witness, may this oath bind me to death and beyond...[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]I do swear my blood and honor to the service of Ulfric Stormcloak...[QUOTE]
That's the spirit. By swearing this oath you become one of us. A hero of the people. A true son of Skyrim. A Stormcloak. Repeat after me.
That's the spirit. By swearing this oath you become one of us. A heroine of the people. A true daughter of Skyrim. A Stormcloak. Repeat after me.
Ahraan. You wound me, Dovahkiin. I may not tell the whole truth, but I am no liar.
Go and see for yourself. Zu'u ni bo nol het. I will be here... unless Alduin returns before you do.
All right! I knew you'd do it. This is going to be so fun. You can't even imagine!
And don't always just do what you're told. Nobody rules anybody in the Companions.
Oh, don't worry too much about it. They were all whelps once. They just might not like to talk about it.
Bah, I'm not afraid of anything out here. Walls are just a weakling's hiding spot.
Now me, I'm no weakling. In fact, I bet I've got the strongest arms in all of Skyrim.
Better to work in the cold than in the heat, I say. Though some sun would be nice.
The weather's harsh, but I like to think my sunny personality is what helps the grain grow.
Of course working for Bolfrida isn't my first choice. But what else can a Dunmer do out here?
Once the sun goes down, it's just me and the dogs. They keep me warm, and don't talk too much.
Starting to get too old to work all day, but hopefully Master Hlaalu will let me slow down a bit.
I wonder if I could put the dogs to work somehow. But I don't really have the heart to force them.
Bolfrida is certainly grating, but she pays well. Thankfully nobody from the city can see me out here.
My sister and I both work for the Nords. Our brother is ashamed of us, but at least we can affort to eat.
Welcome, welcome, welcome! Don't see many strangers out here. Come to get your hands dirty on a real farm?
Nothing tastes better than food you've grown yourself. Something magic about dirt and sunshine making food.
Of course, without functioning mills, who will make the arrows for our soldiers? Men have no sense of irony.
Every now and then someone from the city comes by. Think they aren't used to seeing a Nord working for a Dark Elf.
There's plenty of good wood around here, but I just can't harvest it all by myself. Everyone able-bodied is fighting.
Master Cruel-Sea comes and works the fields sometimes. I don't think the Mistress likes it, but she won't come out here to catch him.
I used to have five good men who worked the mill with me. Then this war started and they all ran off. Idiots with mead in their blood.
Farm work is hard work. It's good to relax when I can, but I still have to listen to my brothers harping about [QUOTE]injustices.[QUOTE]
Do you believe all this talk of dragons? Can the ancient ones truly have returned?
I feel pity for these Nords. When the dragons attack cities and towns, they will lose everything.
S'rendarr be merciful! What ill fortune that this should happen now, while we are trying to make a living.
I wish I could say that I did not, but in every part of Skyrim, there is talk of dragon sightings. It is no coincidence.
And we will lose customers. Let us hope that if there are dragons, there are only a few and they are not too foul-tempered.
We are fortunate. We travel lightly, and can escape at a moment's notice. We have no home that a dragon can burn to the ground.
Dragons have always been able to Shout. Language is intrinsic to their very being.
For most people, long years of training are required to learn even the simplest Shout.
But for you, the dragon speech is in your blood, and you learn it almost without effort.
In mythic times, when mortalkind was in great need, the goddess Kynareth granted us the ability to speak as dragons do.
There is no difference in the dragon tongue between debating and fighting. Shouting comes as naturally to a dragon as breathing, or speaking.
Fortunately, the quill required an ink with a unique formula known only to myself.
So if you're getting any ideas about selling it to someone else or keeping it, you'll find it would hold little value.
Helping out Ainethach, huh? Give me a reason not to plunge a dagger in your chest.
I guess he's better at all that talking stuff anyway. I'd just mess everything up.
Maul? Yeah. That jerk works for Maven Black-Briar now. Left me down here watching this garbage heap.
I guess I'll stay on the lookout. Keep your nose clean while you're here outsider.
I probably shouldn't tell everyone who asks. This is important business, you know.
I see... and this [QUOTE]force of habit,[QUOTE] does it also compel you to murder?
I tried to tell him that he wouldn't get past the traps, but he wouldn't listen...
Aye, and she's added more traps now as well... A moment of silence for our fallen friend...
It was a stupid plan, and now Rigel is so mad she won't even let us cut him down from there!
I'll tell you what. You help me get the treasure and I'll split it with you. Deal?
If you come across any Imperials in your travels, I expect you'll know what to do.
What more could I ask of you? No, you're free to roam. I suspect the gods have needs for you elsewhere.
To begin with, killing any Legionnaire you find out in the wilderness. I've reports they've hidden military camps out there.
With luck, they'll soon lose heart and return to their homes and families. If not, we'll be forced to put them all to the sword.
To begin with, killing any Legionnaire you find out in the wilderness. I've reports they've hidden military camps out there out there.
The Legion's work is far from finished, but you are free to roam. I suspect you'll be of greater good to Skyrim out there, in the world.
That said, some of the Legion's staunchest men have organized themselves, and are operating out of hidden military camps in the wilderness.
Ulfric is dead and his army destroyed. There's not much more I could ask of you. The gods, however, I suspect, may have plans for you elsewhere.
No. I trust you'll do more good out there in the world, wherever you damn well please to go. You're a true son of Skyrim. You'll know what to do.
If while you're out there, you stumble into any Stormcloak military camps, I expect you to destroy them. I've reports they are hiding in the hills.
That said, Stormcloak true believers are still operating out of hidden military camps in the hills. If you encounter any on you travels, kill them.
True sons and daughters of Skyrim reign in every city, we've crippled the Imperial Legion, and cut off its head by killing General Tullius himself.
No. I trust you'll do more good out there in the world, wherever you damn well please to go. You're a true daughter of Skyrim and'll know what to do.
If you plant this in the vermin's nest, it should stop them from ever coming back.
I bought some poison. I was going to have my lazy, good-for-nothing assistant Mallus handle it, but he seems to have vanished.
It is Ri'saad who owns the three trading caravans that travel the roads of Skyrim.
He provided the funds to start this caravan, and put me in charge of it. I owe him more than I could ever hope to repay.
Long ago, I was an orphan on the streets of Corinthe. I stowed away aboard a trade ship that brought me here. It was Ri'saad who found me.
Look around you, I'm barely keeping this rathole together. The war's seen to that.
Near as I can tell, a bunch of ancient Nord hermits who live on top of a mountain.
They live in seclusion on the slopes of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim.
They're the Masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting. They live up on top of the Throat of the World.
Ulfric can tell you more than most anyone. He was studying to be a Greybeard himself, back before the Great War.
If you're really Dragonborn, they'll want to talk to you. In the old stories, they always summon the Dragonborn for training.
They're masters of the Way of the Voice. If you really are Dragonborn, they're the ones who can teach you how to use your power.
Never heard of them talking to anybody before. If they really do want to talk to you, you'd better go find out what they want. You never know.
No, no. I'm just a simple herbalist. You'll want to see Arcadia, over in Whiterun.
No, no. Mostly, I'm just a simple herbalist. Lami over in Morthal should be able to help you.
Nocturnal doesn't care about you, the Key or anything having to do with the Guild.
What's Karliah been filling your head with? Tales of thieves with honor? Oaths rife with falsehoods and broken promises?
Now, I'm a busy man and your pointless questions are boring me terribly. Good day.
As long as I'm left alone to pursue my research, I don't care who gives the orders.
If I said that was a tedious question, would you be smart enough to know what I meant? Probably not.
Oh. All right... I guess I'll just keep practicing on my own. Sorry to bother you.
Really? Perhaps the amulet is important somehow. Is there some way you can use it?
Same thing we do with all the other natives who want to change things around here.
We had a nice little deal going between Thonar and Madanach until you and Eltrys started snooping around.
Well, you wanted to find the man responsible for those killings? You'll have plenty of time with the King in Rags when you're in Cidhna mine.
She's the mistress of night and darkness and the patron of every thief in Tamriel.
So you're just one of Aren's lackeys? That's disappointing. You show real promise.
You come here, kill my assistants, disrupt my work... You've annoyed me, so I don't think I'll be giving you anything.
So... I've taken us this far, but you need to guide us the rest of the way. Drink.
I'm relieved you discovered a bottle intact; this place looks as though it was ransacked by the orcs.
Someone actually interested in what I'm doing? Amazing! Well, allow me to explain.
My experimentation involves a magical construct and a reagent that will allow the construct to maintain a field of permanent harmonic energy!
Thane Bryling, what do you have to report about the state of Haafingar's defenses?
Humph. That's only a problem for people who can't afford to hire their own security.
I don't see any reason why we'd need them. As long as those dogs stay outside of our borders, we're fine.
That may well be our only answer. I will empower my Steward to seek out capable individuals to secure Haafingar. Thank you, my Thanes.
Trouble on the roads and cities means less commerce. Less commerce means less money and more starving people. And that means more crime.
My dear Bryling. Barring any... fancy and folly... the good people of Haafingar are surely capable of dealing with the odd highwayman or stray dog.
The Stormcloaks are far from the only threat to the hold. The roads are beset by bandits and beasts... and now there's even talk of bloody dragons.
The news is the same as it's been for the rest of the war, your grace. Our borders are secure, but at the cost of the guards for our towns and roads.
That's it then. After all of those years of helplessly watching the Guild decline.
But enough of that... I'm confident that with you in charge, we'll soon have more gold than we could possibly spend.
The tome bears the likeness of Vaermina on the cover. It should be here somewhere.
We're looking for a book of alchemical recipes called [QUOTE]The Dreamstride.[QUOTE]
The walls have ears and you're being tested, lad. We'll talk in the Ragged Flagon.
The walls have ears and you're being tested, lass. We'll talk in the Ragged Flagon.
The World-Eater waits within the mist! Bring word to Shor's hall of our hard fate!
There is only silence right now. Perhaps later we will hear one of the lost Words.
You have learned so much already, Dragonborn. Growing your gift too quickly would be dangerous.
Finding these lost Words would be a sufficient test, to temper your abilities with experience. Ask when you are ready to search.
But there are many Words of Power in Skyrim, carved in the Dragon tongue. Even from here, we can feel the Thu'um resonate from them.
They threw me in here until they were ready to use me in one of their experiments.
This wasn't supposed to happen. I thought they wanted my help, not to use me as a test subject!
Turn my back on these people when their lives could be at stake? I should say not.
Those dreams are not just visions, they're a footprint left by the Daedric Lord Vaermina as she drains these people of their memories!
Wealth is my business. Help me out and I can add to yours. Would you like a taste?
What? Oh, hardly! I don't think even Ulfric could pull a dragon out of his pocket.
Lucky for us it attacked when it did, eh? I wasn't looking forward to getting a shave from the Imperial headsman.
When Mercer stole the Key, that conduit closed, severely limiting our ties to her.
The Sepulcher isn't merely a temple or a vault to house the Key. Within these walls is the Ebonmere... a conduit to Nocturnal's realm of Evergloam.
Wise move. Now get out of here ya goat licker, before I decide the toll's gone up.
You're passing through Solitude? Maybe you're looking to make some easy gold, yes?
All the food I could eat, all the wine I could drink and all the women I could bed.
Don't get me wrong. The first few years with that clan were some of the best years of my life.
Am I sensing that you may be interested in gathering these rare ingredients for me?
To restore Master Elgrim's supply I would need 20 deathbell, 20 nightshade and 20 nirnroot.
An intelligent, beautiful woman like her wouldn't fall for that nonsense... I hope.
He's a bard, so he says. Occasionally he finds time to do his job here at the mill.
Thinks his ballads and sonnets are going to convince Camilla Valerius to marry him. As if she would say [QUOTE]yes.[QUOTE]
And that we were sworn to protect the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer of all.
But then the dragons returned. And I remembered that the Blades used to be dragonslayers.
Turns out, we fatally underestimated the Thalmor. They smashed us with ease during the Great War.
I was one of the few who escaped. For a long time, all I cared about was staying alive, and taking revenge on the Thalmor when I could.
And, while you're at it, make a little bit of coin on the side. Not a bad deal, eh?
You can get out there and start making a name for us again... make them start fearing us like they did long ago.
Back off, this action's all mine. No room for anyone else in the Guild on this one.
But I digress. Here, take these. They need to be delivered to your, um... superior.
That is correct. What I ask is no small thing, of course. But you represent the Dark Brotherhood. This is... what you do? No?
You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now, it's as if the very stars have finally aligned.
Damn it. The priests must have activated this barrier when the Miasma was released.
Don't look at me. I didn't kill her. I was just... making sure the body got buried.
For now, I will maintain my ruse here. You are always welcome in the Bannered Mare.
At last. I can rest safely. You have done me a great service, warrior. I cannot thank you enough.
Take this reward. I managed to sneak some of my wealth out of Hammerfell when I left. It's the least I can do.
Good, then you understand why this is about more than just Mercer's lust for power.
Halt. The Dwemer Museum isn't open to anyone without the court wizard's permission.
He's my son. I just... I feel it in my heart. You'd understand if you had children.
His request is denied... I'm not paying him any more gold. This madness has to end.
Then go back to your boss and tell him what I've already told him so many times, I lose count.
However, I did notice she was quite angry and it was being directed at Mercer Frey.
Not at all. I tend not to ask too many questions when I'm on the job. I'm sure you understand.
I can almost... hear them. I feel their life energy. Come, I will make the mixture.
I can promise you if it comes to that, and my back's to the wall, I won't hesitate.
I did. I was known as Ghorbash gro-Dushnikh in those days, in honor of my homeland.
Many Orcs leave the stronghold to join the Legion. They welcome our skill in battle and smithing, and we welcome a chance to see the world.
I just handed you the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. Does that make me Dragonborn, too?
I hope so. But you'll forgive me if I don't assume that something's true just because the Greybeards say so.
I was actually just about to head on inside. Be good to have someone watch my back.
Follow me, and keep your eyes open. Daedra are powerful creatures and tricksters. Never know what you'll find.
I'm a soldier, not a politician. And my personal beliefs are not yours to question.
I'm feeling a sense of inner peace... something I haven't felt in a very long time.
Instead of being clouded with thoughts of revenge and retribution, I feel only serenity and fulfillment.
Of course, I've been also dabbling in my old pastimes as well. Take a look around, and feel free to share the fruits of my labor.
I've been thinking... maybe Camilla needs a little help seeing Sven for what he is.
I've finally located Vokun's crypt! The scroll I'm looking for just has to be here.
If you want to know more, I'm sure you can find any number of tomes on the subject.
So great was his reign in life, when he ascended to the heavens he was made lord of the Divines.
Talos mastered the power of the Voice, and with it he united the lands of men into a great Empire.
Hello, my friend! If you seek knowledge about mighty Talos, you have most certainly come to the right person.
In southern lands, he was known by the name Tiber Septim. Here in Skyrim, we honor him by his proper Nord name.
In mortal life, Talos was a Nord possessed of unmatched tactical skill, limitless wisdom and the power to see into men's hearts.
It also makes it easier to gather water when the canal is right out the front door.
Besides, I also prefer the quiet. I didn't open this business for browsing. Come in, buy what you need and get out.
The moisture in the air is better for the ingredients. It isn't every day that you get your hands on fresh nirnroot or painted troll fat.
It is none of your concern, I assure you. Just... Forget that you ever saw me here.
It's an illegal substance highly favored by the Khajiit. Very difficult to come by.
If Moon Sugar is refined properly, it can be used to make skooma, another substance that will knock you over after a single draught.
Just make sure to take care of whatever's going on there. It's my name on the line.
Let's get moving, I want to catch her inside while she's distracted. Take the lead.
No, I found her horse. Don't worry, I've taken care of it... she won't be using it to escape.
Make sure to pull your bow all the way back to get the most power out of your shot.
Only a fool lets himself get surrounded. Back up and make them come at you one at a time.
You can eat an ingredient to learn one of its properties. However, they taste disgusting.
Those big, powerful blows are tiring. Pace yourself until you've got the stamina to do one.
You can make your own potions by mixing up to three ingredients together. Just use the Alchemy Lab.
Want to improve your armor? Use the workbench. Make sure you have the right raw materials, such as iron or steel.
If you know an enchantment and have a filled soul gem, you can enchant armor and weapons. Just use the arcane enchanter.
If you want to make new armor or weapons, use the forge. It takes plenty of raw materials though, such as iron or steel.
If you want to sharpen your blade, use the grindstone. Although you'll need the right raw materials, such as iron or steel.
Don't just stand still to do your big wind-up blows. Which way you're moving changes what happens and can be a big advantage.
Any fool can just flail about, swinging his weapon as fast as he can. Any fool can die. Keep your guard up and wait for an opening.
Even if your opponent doesn't have a shield, those big, powerful blows can stagger him. Leaves him open for a quick follow up blow.
In a fight, if you see a big wind up, get out of the way or bash him with your shield. Attacks like that go right through a regular block.
When the other guy has his shield up, regular blows are useless. Wind up and hit him with a really powerful attack to get past that shield.
Using two weapons means you've got no defense. You can't block anything. But if you hit him with both at the same time, he may not get up again.
Before you can enchant your weapon or armor, you'll need to learn an enchantment by sacrificing an enchanted item. Just use the arcane enchanter.
No one escapes. I thought keeping Madanach down there would keep him under control.
My prison. The source of half the silver in Skyrim. The most secure prison in Tamriel.
No. I think he was entirely wrong. Roggvir's execution was justified and necessary.
Being honorable might make you a good man, but it doesn't make you right. Be a better world if it did.
Oh, yes. J'zargo hopes to find things that will make him a more powerful mage here.
Hopefully small things that fit inside pockets, and will not be noticed if they are missing.
Ooookay.... Um.... Let me see. Thistle? Yes, let's try that. Just a sprig or two...
Perhaps only its creators ever knew it. But I am not the one to speak of it to you.
But not Dragonrend. The knowledge of that Shout was lost in the time before history began.
Perhaps. They could be nonsense... inane scribbles done by someone in idle boredom.
But if not... if they actually mean something, they might tell me where I'm from... what ship was I on. Everything.
Reyda was here, then gone. Went to gather plants and never came home... nope, nope.
Everyone looked and no one could find her. Wilhelm said she'll be back... told Narfi not to worry... Reyda will come back.
Shut up. Only the gods can judge me. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?
Slay him in the coldest of blood. Do not give him the dignity of defending himself.
Once his corpse lays cold upon the ground, and all trace of his followers erased, retrieve my Ebony Mail. A gift fit only for my true champion.
Kill every single member of his band. Do so as silently and invisibly as you can, for this is not about you. You are to be my instrument in this.
That can have interesting results. Some victims may flee, others may cower in fear.
Me? I like to talk to my targets before the kill. Taunt them, scare them... even challenge them.
If you can goad a target into attacking you first, you may even find any local guards coming to your aid.
That is where I learned to cook, and where I belong. Not here, with all these dogs.
Yes. The finest court in all of High Rock. You think politics here are something? Well, we Bretons invented politics.
That's what I like to hear. I'll get the full report from Legate Rikke. Now then...
The Agent of Subterfuge utilizes shadow to cloud the judgement of those around him.
By weaving the darkness to their will, this agent can manipulate others into fighting for the Nightingale for a limited time.
Then my answer is the Hall of the Dead is closed. By order of the Jarl. Understand?
There is peace now, and that peace will continue for as long as it suits our needs.
But make no mistake, this is not a peace forged out of necessity between rival nations of equal strength.
It is more like the calm between storms. And the next storm, I think, will be far deadlier than the last.
There's no need to be concerned. We've been through more difficult times than this.
I'll speak to the Jarl and see what I can do. Just keep them at bay a little longer.
I think we need to prepare for the worst. The coffers are dwindling and I can barely keep our contacts happy.
Normally I'd agree, but we've already lost so many contacts across Skyrim. If we lose the ones in Riften, we may as well close up shop.
They were apparently under the impression we were keeping it in a closet somewhere.
I see. Well yes, I suppose I did mention it, though I'm not sure what he expects me to tell you.
I only brought it to his attention a few months back when the Synod showed up here looking for it.
They're not the sort to take visitors, but I never go that high up the path anyway.
Some folk who make the trip leave them food or other essentials, but not to make conversation.
Those that shrank from their destiny... well, you've never heard of them, have you?
Only if you don't know how to use it. All the great heroes have had to learn to use their power.
And there are the villains - those that misused their power. There's always a choice, and there's always a risk.
But if you live in fear of what might go wrong, you'll end up doing nothing. Like the Greybeards up on their mountain.
We kill every Thalmor between us and Thorald, and we bring him out alive. Let's go.
Well, it could be worse. The former steward, Proventus, kept very detailed records.
But yes, it's been a lot of work. Vignar doesn't want the change to disrupt the lives of his people. They've got enough to deal with already.
What's the point in protecting this place if the mine's completely useless? Idiots.
They're as useless as a fifth wheel on a wagon. Gave me some sort of a line about [QUOTE]keeping an eye out for enemy soldiers.[QUOTE]
Within these walls, I have all that I need to brew a potion for nearly any ailment.
Of a sort. I don't have formal training in the Restoration school, but... something just as good.
If I had a Septim for every case of Rockjoint or Witbane I've cured since I opened this shop, I'd be a rich woman indeed.
Yes! I like the way you think. There are whispers of where we might find one, too.
They say he killed twelve of the Imperial Legion and shattered their bones with his breath.
Well, that's one way to find out if they're real. I even know where we might find one. Lead on!
I think you and I are worth about a dozen soldiers each. We'll send that beast back where it came from.
You just going to stand there, gawking? Go away. You're starting to... frighten me.
A god? Assuredly not! When was the last time you saw evidence of Aedra in the world?
I am called Boethiah. Many names have mortals given me. But I am not interested in names. I am interested only in deeds.
Ah, splendid! Our fine city has a proud history, and I'm happy to share what I know.
As time passed, a thriving community sprang up around Jorrvaskr, as was common with mead halls.
Today, Whiterun is the jewel of Skyrim. I can say without boast that is the greatest city in all the holds.
The history of Whiterun begins with Jorrvaskr, the hall of the Companions. For a long time, it was the only building on the mountain.
Already did. Part of the reason I'm living out here now. Thanks for offering though.
Alvor? The smith, isn't he? Reliable, solid fellow. Not prone to flights of fancy...
And you're sure Helgen was destroyed by a dragon? This wasn't some Stormcloak raid gone wrong?
Gerdur? Owns the lumber mill, if I'm not mistaken. Pillar of the community. Not prone to flights of fancy...
As I promised, my men stand ready. The great chains are oiled. We wait on your word.
My men will be ready when you are, Dragonborn. You have a truce to arrange first, eh?
We'll be ready, don't worry. You do have a plan for actually luring a dragon into this trap, don't you?
Azura's Star. A Daedric artifact that allows any number of souls to pass through it.
Some of us wanted to find out how. I was working under Malyn Varen, then. If only we knew what he was really planning.
Can't blame you for having better things to do than help some farmer you don't know.
Do not mistake our life for one of stupidity. It would be the last mistake you make.
Are you blind, or just stupid? You think the tribe has not seen you talking to me? You think they would not know?
Don't get smart with me. I'm in charge. You keep it up, I'll have your toes cut off.
Exactly! And now I have to stare at these bars for eight months. Can you believe it?
I'd do anything to have that whore's head on a platter. All I need to know is where she is.
I was about to let that wench marry into the richest family in Riften, and this is how she repays me.
Filthy creatures, aren't they? Living in the darkness, like they do. So uncivilized.
I prefer finery. Like this. Here, for your trouble. And I suppose I should show you a little about Illusion magic for free, shouldn't I?
Go, seek your fate. I will be watching, and perhaps we will meet again - afterwards.
Good. Can't have the buyer getting impatient and looking elsewhere for this, can we?
Here, take this. I certainly can't use it, but I suppose I need to pay you something for the goods.
Ha! Remarkable! Well, the old bastard certainly made it worth your while, didn't he?
Ha! Why you are, silly! You are the Listener! You are the Listener! Such a kidder...
Oh, well, the Listener is the only person the Night Mother speaks to. It is the highest honor attainable by a member of the Dark Brotherhood.
You must realize what a great honor this is. For the Night Mother to have chosen you... I am just in awe. You have Cicero's utmost confidence!
Ah, but there has not been a Listener in years and years. Our Lady has not chosen Cicero, and certainly not Astrid. Or... anyone. But some day...
Of course our Lady is dead, so she doesn't talk with words, since her lips are... rotted. But inside the Listener's head. I hear it's... intimate.
He didn't like the Arch-Mage. Hated dealing with him, hated having to answer to him.
I understand he settled down in Hjaalmarch, and his presence there caused something of a problem.
Falion said he hated what this place was becoming. So he just left. Aren found a note on his desk, and that was it.
I am a traveler. A pilgrim. I follow the voice of Kynareth wherever it can be heard.
I've dreamed of seeing Eldergleam for years. Might I travel alongside you? I promise not to get in the way.
I can assure you that this is entirely false. We are fully in control of everything.
There are those that believe the Jarl does nothing for this city... that it's corrupt and run by the Black-Briar family.
I couldn't be more proud to be a part of the Thieves Guild, or its new Guild Master.
Take a good look around you! Have you ever see the Guild in such a prosperous state?
With Mercer Frey gone and our influence spreading across Skyrim, the Guild's earned a new level of respect it hasn't seen in decades.
With Mercer Frey gone and our influence present in all of Skyrim's cities, the Guild's accumulating wealth faster than we can spend it.
I don't know. I never expected the old bag to follow me so far. Just get rid of him.
But don't kill him. I don't hate the man. I just want him to go back to his farm and forget about me.
I don't think so, Madena. There will be no deserters in this hold, and that's final.
Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking. I'm not a Nord, I'm a Breton, and I have no wish to fight this war.
You wish to leave now? In Skyrim's moment of triumph, just before we cast off the yoke of Imperial rule?
Skald, I've been meaning to ask you for a leave of absence. I wish to return to High Rock until this war is over.
I worship Peryite, yes, because sometimes the world can only be cleansed by disease.
He is the pus in the wound. Oh, proper ones curl their noses, but it's pus that drinks foul humors and restores the blood.
I'm sure some of the locals can point you in the right direction once you get there.
An old tomb, built by the ancient Nords, perhaps dating back to the Dragon War itself.
Ah. Maybe you just want to know how to get there. It's near Riverwood, a miserable little village a few miles south of here.
If by [QUOTE]work[QUOTE] you mean [QUOTE]testing your steel in bloody battle.[QUOTE]
Ain't sure if they're takin' on new members, but you should talk to the Companions. They're over in their hall, Jorrvaskr.
Is that confidence I hear... or is it arrogance? Strange how often they're confused.
You have to understand, it's been a long time since Brynjolf's sent me anyone I can rely on.
It took so long. So very long. But now that you're here, you can accept my contract.
It was my pleasure. It's not often I get visitors out here. Let alone friendly ones.
It was so lucrative, I was considering moving the Guild to Solitude to save us time.
When Gulum-Ei was getting us merchandise from the East Empire Company, we were making a hefty profit.
It wasn't easy getting all your things. A few guards had to have their throats slit.
Look, we've got to deal with this situation. You've got to deal with this situation.
My original intention was to use that arrow on Mercer, but I never had a clear shot.
I made a split second decision to get you out of the way and it prevented your death.
No. This is my land. You expect me to just hand it over to those Silver-Blood thugs?
No... please, you have to help me! You don't understand what they do to people here!
What? Why? But... you must have said something to Erikur! You lied to him and now here I am! You're a heartless monster!
Not a damn thing. I was just as surprised as you to find that big black dragon here.
Not many would walk blindly into a crypt, smelling of steel and blood, but not fear.
It's all right. I will not shun you for what you are. Stay. I will tell you everything you have forgotten.
I feel the hunger inside of you. Gnawing at you. You see the dead and your mouth grows wet. Your stomach growls.
Now do whatever it is you need to do, and let's get going before we miss our chance!
This is no time for cold feet. I've put everything in your hands here, not least Malborn's life.
Now then. I hope you have something nice to wear. Because you're going to a wedding.
But moving on to business. As you probably already know from reading the letter... you're going to a wedding.
Splendid. Then we're ready to begin. Or, more specifically, you're ready to begin. After all, you're the one the Night Mother spoke to.
The sealed letter you delivered to me was mysteriously unsealed upon its arrival. I can only assume you've read its contents. Sloppy...
But by Sithis, I hope I'm making the right choice here. You may be an effective killer, but your command of guile leaves much to be desired.
Now, I really got to get back to the body. Lot of work to prepare her for the grave.
Of course. Ulfric's cause is just. It's time for Skyrim to rid itself of the Empire.
Perhaps not. But this Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again.
Sabjorn keeps that locked up tight. If you can get through that way, go right ahead.
So we send in Vex and find out he's hired a bunch of mercenaries to guard the place.
Goldenglow Estate brought in a mountain of gold for the Guild. You could almost call it our sweetest deal.
Then out of the clear blue, Aringoth stops sending us our cut. Mercer was... well, angry to put it kindly.
Sorry, I didn't mean to get carried away. There we go, one cup of diced horker meat.
Hmmm... horker. So delicious. I swear, is there a soul alive who doesn't enjoy the taste of...
Talos the mighty! Talos the unerring! Talos the unassailable! To you we give praise!
[QUOTE]I breathe now, in royalty, and reshape this land which is mine. I do this for you, Red Legions, for I love you.[QUOTE]
So rise up! Rise up, children of the Empire! Rise up, Stormcloaks! Embrace the word of mighty Talos, he who is both man and Divine!
Aye, love. Love! Even as man, great Talos cherished us. For he saw in us, in each of us, the future of Skyrim! The future of Tamriel!
Trust in me, Whiterun! Trust in Heimskr! For I am the chosen of Talos! I alone have been anointed by the Ninth to spread his holy word!
And what does the Empire do? Nothing! Nay, worse than nothing! The Imperial machine enforces the will of the Thalmor! Against its own people!
For we are the children of man! And we shall inherit both heavens and earth! And we, not the Elves or their toadies, will rule Skyrim! Forever!
The very idea is inconceivable to our Elven overlords! Sharing the heavens with us? With man? Ha! They can barely tolerate our presence on earth!
Today, they take away your faith. But what of tomorrow? What then? Do the elves take your homes? Your businesses? Your children? Your very lives?
We are but maggots, writhing in the filth of our own corruption! While you have ascended from the dung of mortality, and now walk among the stars!
Terrible and powerful Talos! We, your unworthy servants, give praise! For only through your grace and benevolence may we truly reach enlightenment!
And deserve our praise you do, for we are one! Ere you ascended and the Eight became Nine, you walked among us, great Talos, not as god, but as man!
And there it is, friends! The ugly truth! We are the children of man! Talos is the true god of man! Ascended from flesh, to rule the realm of spirit!
But you were once man! Aye! And as man, you said, [QUOTE]Let me show you the power of Talos Stormcrown, born of the North, where my breath is long winter.[QUOTE]
Talos, who in life was known as Tiber Septim, united Tamriel and founded the Empire.
He was rewarded for his deeds by being joined with the Divines in eternal glory. The only mortal to do so.
We worship him that we might follow in his path. We can't literally join him in the heavens, but we may do our best to know them here on Nirn.
Thank you so much, this scroll means a lot to my family. Take this for your trouble.
The Blades are wise not to trust me. Onikaan ni ov. I would not trust another dovah.
The Jarl needs to know if there's a dragon on the loose. Riverwood is defenseless...
We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever troops he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt.
We make easy pickings for thieves looking to steal everything we worked so hard for.
Are you kidding me? We're all alone out here except for a few guards who couldn't give a damn about us.
Not only did I they take my bow, but they took all of our coin as well. Nothing's sacred to these people.
Yes, absolutely. Your skill is your own... don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise.
But Nocturnal, she influences our luck; nearly imperceptible assistance we get when we ply our trade.
You really don't remember stealing a goat and selling her to a Giant? Are you thick?
Go get her! At least she's bound to follow you back - you smell just like the fermented feed she likes.
You will not disrespect Jarl Idgrod while in this Hall. Do we have an understanding?
You're damned right it does. I'll never breed another prize-winning goat like Gleda!
And don't you think of coming back to Rorikstead until you get her back from that Giant.
You've got a lot of nerve, walking around here dressed like an Imperial Legionnaire.
What do you think you're doing, walking around dressed like a damn Stormcloak traitor?
As soon as we drive the Empire out of Skyrim, the dragons will vanish. Mark my words.
The only reason dragons are attacking is because Talos is angry with us for turning our backs on him.
Before we depart, Brynjolf has some business to discuss. I suggest you listen to him.
Bottom line - respect your Family. Do that, and everything else will fall into place.
Used to be the Dark Brotherhood was bound by Five Tenets, but we stopped following those years ago.
All those rules, all that discipline, and look where the Dark Brotherhood ended up. We're the last of our kind, and we live the way we see fit.
But more importantly, I am a daughter of Skyrim and wish to see her made whole again.
I am a loyal citizen of the Empire. My parents were Legionnaires, and I've followed in their footsteps.
Creature like that'll make a man think long and hard about what he wants out of life.
Been about eight years now. I used to be a mercenary, but one trip to Ravenscar Hollow cured me of that.
There's hagravens in that cave with talons like daggers. They'll open your bowels quick as a wink if you let 'em get close.
Either way, the trick was in the escape, and that's where my strengths came in handy.
Usually it's to free someone the client cares about... and sometimes to... well, to kill someone on their behalf.
It's where a client pays you to get arrested, and you get thrown into a prison for the express purpose of breaking out.
He's so afraid to talk to me he's sending you to do it? I should've expected as much.
I'm afraid you've been a little mis-informed. I have something of mine, that I was going to sell to Arniel.
I can also provide a few supplies useful to our trade now and again, for a small fee.
I'm the fence down here. You come by anything you don't exactly own and I'll pay you some coin for it. Minus a little slice for the Guild, of course.
I hope for all your sakes you find out who's behind this supposed [QUOTE]plot.[QUOTE]
Yes, we spoke at length while you were in Whiterun dealing with our meadery situation.
I might well ask the same of you, running around by yourself in this dangerous place.
I am on official business of the Grand Council of the Synod. That's all you need to know.
I should think so! I'm well used to taking care of a house and the folk living in it.
I just hope I can do right by the good folk who are looking to us to see to their needs.
Taking care of the entire hold is another matter entirely. It would be a big enough job without the war on and the dragons about.
I trust you, I'm just concerned about her safety. That's all. Don't be angry with me.
I'm not angry with you. Tell you what, lover. Meet me in my chambers later and we can discuss the situation in private.
Anuriel, would you please stop declaring that the city is safe for the Jarl to roam? You and I both know that isn't true.
I would never knowingly place Laila in danger, you know that too. Why do you always question my judgment? You don't trust me.
I'll get word for him to meet you in Solitude, at the Winking Skeever -- you know it?
His name's Malborn. Wood elf, plenty of reason to hate the Thalmor. You can trust him.
Meet me at the Solitude stables after you've arranged things with Malborn. Any questions?
While you're doing that, I'll work on getting you an invitation to Elenwen's little party.
I have a contact inside the Embassy. He's not up for this kind of high-risk mission, but he can help you.
The Thalmor ambassador, Elenwen, regularly throws parties where the rich and connected cozy up to the Thalmor.
I can get you into one of those parties. Once you're inside the Embassy, you get away and find Elenwen's secret files.
It's where people in the city are buried. Fathers. Forefathers. Mothers. Foremothers.
New to Skyrim? I was confused at first, too. The Nords call their mausoleums the Hall of the Dead.
Jarl Igmund can refuse to see me all he wants. The Silver-Blood family will be heard.
There's a war on and you don't know what I'm talking about? The Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for.
Just don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.
They're well-funded and they've been able to avoid identification for years. I'm impressed it reached this point.
No! You're wrong. You must be wrong. Laelette may have met her fate out in the marsh.
I refuse to believe Alva had anything to do with this. There is no way you can prove it to the Jarl.
Of course. Alduin wahlaan daanii. I would not have helped you if I thought otherwise.
Oh, by the Divines is it that obvious? I swear, if my Gunnar was alive to see me now.
You aren't for hire, are you? A sellsword? I'll pay you if you can recover that statuette from the Forsworn.
This store would finally be on its feet if I hadn't lost my last shipment to Forsworn attacks. A specially-made Dibella statuette.
Once you have it, I want you to place it in Brand-Shei's pocket without him noticing.
Simple... I'm going to cause a distraction and you're going to steal Madesi's silver ring from a strongbox under his stand.
Patience, my son. The hunter days not welcome the blood of his prey, he waits for it.
Ah, the air is good today. I welcome the smell of blood from all the kills I will make.
Perfect. Melting this down will give me plenty of gold for those necklaces I started.
Sadly, I am resigned to just reading of its wonders through my research of the Skull.
How I envy you. I can only imagine the excitement of seeing history through the eyes of another!
Shor's beard! He's going after the Eyes of the Falmer? That was Gallus's pet project.
If he gets his hands on them, you can be certain he'll be gone for good and set up for life.
Susanna's the third. It's always the same: young girl, killed at night, body torn up.
Thank Kynareth for you, stranger. I'd almost given up hope of walking away from here.
That I am. My father left it to me after he died in that Great War against the Elves.
I don't care what's going on in the world. Rebellion. Dragons awakening. The mill is enough trouble for me to worry about.
That means more time for my experiments and less time in the field. Much appreciated.
That... I gave it to her on our wedding day. Help me, Divines... it's true isn't it?
I'm sorry. Keep the ring. I cannot bear the weight of them in my heart, and I must make the journey alone now. Thank you for... thank you.
The thing is, I never wanted to follow in his footsteps... I some ways I still don't.
A Priest of Arkay is entrusted with a ceremonial dagger once they've completed their training.
It usually given by the head priest who sanctified the ritual. In my case, the head priest happened to be my father.
Then turn around and go back where you came. City doesn't need you, doesn't want you.
Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth. That's the way it is. That's the way it'll stay.
There's a man named Braig inside these mines. Besides me, he's been here the longest.
Tell him I sent you. Ask him why he's here. I want you to know how widespread the injustice of Markarth is.
These days, we have more people like you coming in, looking for healing and the like.
We mostly carry herbs and alchemical ingredients, that sort of thing. Before the war, our stock was mostly used for aromatic use in homes, yes.
This shrine is our thanks to her. That none will forget that she watches over us all.
My people, the Dunmer, built it. We fled from Morrowind after Vvardenfell erupted almost 200 years ago.
Those of us who were faithful to Azura were given a vision that led us away from the island before the worst came.
Together, we made short work of them and the last one limped away licking its wounds.
Well, there were eight of them and she'd already killed three by the time I joined the fight.
Very well. Empty the vessels into the sconce near the throne, then sit in the throne.
When you have done so, I will unbind Hevnoraak. He will awaken in a weakened state, but the lich is still to be reckoned with. Be ready.
We also keep a constant vigil against those who practice the vile arts of necromancy.
Priests of Arkay such as myself perform rites for the dead and sometimes console the bereaved.
I asked the question because I was hoping you might be able to help me recover something I've lost.
Well, as I said, Arkay is the god of life and death. You'll find his temples and Halls of the Dead all across Tamriel.
We'll meet you there. Be careful. That part of the Reach is rough country these days.
We're not killing them, they were already dead. We're helping them back to Sovngarde.
Welcome to Eldergleam Sanctuary, my friend. If you have any questions, speak to Asta.
Well, I'm not sure how they've managed it, but they have. No leaders since Ysgramor.
Kodlak is the Harbinger, and he's a sort of advisor for the whole group, but every man is his own. Every woman, her own.
Well, whatever you're doing, keep doing it and you'll have me as a customer for life.
Can't tell you. It's a bit of a trade secret I picked up when I was living in High Rock.
Thanks for that bushel of apples, Marise. They're wonderful. How did you keep them so fresh?
When the orcs invaded the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters here to die.
With a bit of luck, we'll catch them completely off guard and even the odds a little.
First, we're going to take out their sentry, then we'll situate ourselves overlooking the camp.
Next, you'll infiltrate their position and get their attention while we hit them with a barrage of arrows.
Yes, Master Elgrim will be pleased I've restored his stock of these rare ingredients.
Feel free to take what you need from time to time. I'll be refilling it once every few days or so.
I feel I owe a bit more than some meaningless coin for all your diligence. Here, this key unlocks my supply chest at Elgrim's Elixirs.
Yes. I'll give Tullius one more chance to quit Skyrim with his tail between his legs.
You'll be viewing the memory of another through your own eyes and with your own body.
Those around you will perceive you as normal and you will find the words you utter may not be your own.
Thanks to all of these odd principles, there is quite a lot of debate as to whether this is really a dream or just the machinations of Vaermina.
[QUOTE]May those above judge me, and those below take me, if I fail in my duty.[QUOTE]
After all, where is the value in creating art if there is nobody left alive to see it?
I am an artisan, painting in strokes of blood red upon the canvas of life. But yes, I will take coin to fight at your side.
Ah. Well. Hmm... krosis. There is one... detail about Skuldafn I neglected to mention.
All right. I was going to suggest the Jarl hire someone to sort this mess out, anyway.
And me and Mila used to climb up on the roof of Dragonsreach and look for birds' eggs.
But I don't do that stuff anymore. Father keeps catching me and then I get in trouble.
Well, I used to sneak out at night and try to tip over the big ox in the Gray-Manes' yard.
Anyway, after I got back to the Guild, I decided to start calling myself Twice-Killed.
Yeah, I was lucky though. After Vex tore the guy to pieces, she gave me a potion. If she hadn't of been there...
As my Thane, I'm sworn to your service. I'll guard you, and all you own, with my life.
Aye, that I do. I ain't sayin' he was perfect, but he knew what it meant to be a Nord.
They outlawed the worship of Talos, Skyrim's most beloved son. There's thanks for you.
I guess what I'm sayin' is, Ulfric stood up for us, an' for all Skyrim. So who's goin' to stand up for us now?
The Empire's always taken us for granted. Nords died by the thousands in the Great War, and what did the Empire do?
Because Calcelmo doesn't want anyone to go in. He runs the museum, he makes the rules.
You have a problem with that? Go talk to him. You'll find him in front of the ruins during the day. Just down the tunnel.
Black Briar? How dare you shove that swill in my face. I'd rather drink mammoth drool!
Boss was looking for you - said he'd be up at the summit. Better not keep him waiting.
But that isn't important right now. What is important is that you might be Dragonborn.
Yes. We're very old enemies. And if my suspicions are correct, they might have something to do with the dragons returning.
The Thalmor. We're very old enemies. And if my suspicions are correct, they might have something to do with the dragons returning.
Don't be sorry for me. I just - if I would have known it would come to this. Mother...
Excellent. With my brains and your brawn, that treasure will soon be mine... uh, ours.
Exploiting? What's that supposed to mean? Erik works the farm because he's a good lad!
I'm not forcing him to stay here. I know that he wants a life of adventure, but I've told him before that I can't afford to buy him armor.
Folks have gone missing the past few weeks. Word now's that our hunters are gone, too.
Say, if you're traveling, could you keep an eye out for them? Valdr and his men. I think they were after bear up north.
Fortunately, I persevered and the other groups were either killed or they left Skyrim.
I saw what they did to Gallus. I wanted to use the Guild's resources to hunt down Karliah. The others didn't even care he was gone.
Good. All will be revealed in time. Keep playing your part, and Azura will reward you.
Good. Too many Nords in this town have been listening to Ulfric's narrow-minded words.
He's tough, loyal to his men and a good leader, but if you're not a Nord, Ulfric will never trust you.
He is our creator and master. The Daedric Lord of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse.
He watches over all Orcs as his children. A truth those who leave the stronghold are quick to forget.
Malacath teaches us to honor all words with action. To demand blood from your enemies and strength from your allies.
He is the Daedric Lord of the Orcs. The keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse.
We live by his code and follow his teachings. An outlander like you wouldn't understand.
You do not remember the Daedric Lord of the Orcs? The keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse?
We live by his code and follow his teachings. Spend some time with the wise woman and you'll remember.
Hmm. There's no simple answer to that. You want the long version or the short version?
I don't know exactly. We need to find the ancient burial mound. Let's ask around town.
That mound you remembered sounds like what we're looking for. East of Kynesgrove, right?
I had no idea you were a woman of violence. What exactly are you intending to do here?
I had no idea you were a man of violence. What exactly are your intentions in this blessed place?
I have done no such thing, nor do I intend to. I simply wish to live my life in peace.
If you stand before me to accuse me of sacrificing children, or eating the hearts of the dead, you may save your breath.
I know what you want. Word travels fast around here. Discovered some big mystery, huh?
Well you don't even need to ask. No, I don't have anything for you. Not anymore, anyway.
I understand. Some journeys must be taken alone. I'll be here if you change your mind.
I wish I knew. The journal is written in some sort of language I've never seen before.
If one of my enemies wouldn't pay to have me killed, I'd take it as a personal insult.
Fool! Don't you get it? I live in the shadow of death every day. A knife in every doorway, a nocked arrow on every rooftop!
Jarl Igmund can't ignore us for much longer. Not if the Silver-Blood family has a say.
Finally, someone with decent sense. The Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos.
Looks like you're still in one piece. And more importantly, so is the book. Thank you.
My camp is nearby in the ruins of Nilheim. Get me there safely and you'll be rewarded.
My men know what to do. Make sure you do your part. I'm putting my city in your hands.
My purpose in using Snow Veil Sanctum to ambush Mercer wasn't simply for irony's sake.
Before both of you arrived, I recovered a journal from Gallus's remains. I suspect the information we need is written inside.
Nevertheless, my Order will not act directly. You must take it upon yourself to do so.
You must understand, the Psijic Order does not typically... intervene directly in events.
I'm all too aware that my arrival has aroused suspicion, especially in Ancano, your Thalmor associate.
My presence here will be seen as an affront to some within the Order, and as soon as we have finished, I will be leaving your College.
Not a chance. Not for this. You're going to the Cidhna Mine for the rest of your days.
Well... maybe just this once. But there's still a price on your head. Better make yourself scarce, or we'll have to do this little dance again.
Oh, that's right. I keep forgetting to pick that up. Poor Kerah, such a patient woman.
Now, you're supposed to get something for your trouble, aren't you? How about some gold? People seem to like that, I notice.
Oh. I... well, I honestly didn't expect you to come back. Of course, I'm glad you did!
Now... I don't really want to touch that thing, though. Do you think you could handle the next steps?
Only Paarthurnax, the master of our order, can answer that question, if he so chooses.
To get the answers you seek, you must travel to the top of the mountain and speak to our master, Paarthurnax.
Paarthurnax. The dragon, that the Greybeards have been protecting for all these years.
He's a dragon. Not just any dragon, but the right hand of Alduin, responsible for many atrocities during the ancient Dragon War.
Perhaps you should start at the docks and work your way out towards Goldenglow Estate.
Vald said his rowboat struck some rocks... I'd check under the water near one of the small islands in the lake.
Private Morrard... Angela's daughter was in that scouting party. She needs to be told.
He sent out a party to scout the area. They happened upon a large force... I'm told none of them made it back.
Her daughter was sent to Whiterun, the skirmishes there have been violent. The whiterun legate, he needed to know the Stormcloak positions.
So what do you have to say for yourself? How can I be sure you're not an Imperial spy?
Normally, I would have welcomed someone like you -- resourceful, clearly no friend of the Empire.
But I've had some disturbing reports of you... seen talking to General Tullius in Castle Dour, for example.
Are you now? You were at Helgen, one of the prisoners. Although no one seems to know how you got mixed up in that affair.
Sure, but he'll ask for a whole lot. I mean, you are asking him to betray Mercer Frey.
Of course, you could just run him through and take what you need off of his corpse... I could care less.
Your best bet would be to erase his debt with Maven Black-Briar. If you talk to her, she might be able to give you the details.
Sure, how about I get Dirge to knock you over your head and dump you into the cistern?
At the end of the day you'll find all we care about down here is how much gold you can make us.
Look, I've been in this business a long time and I've seen all types. You can play it tough, you can play it smart... whatever.
That's the spirit. I'll get all the details from Galmar when he gets back. Now then...
There are no expectations. This College is a place to study and practice magic freely.
Hopefully any discoveries made in your pursuits will be shared with the members of the College first. That way we all benefit.
Try Hulda, the innkeeper at the Bannered Mare. It's just up the road, near the market.
Try Olfina, the new innkeeper at the Bannered Mare. It's just up the road, near the market.
You should check in at Dragonsreach, too. There's so much going on these days, the Jarl or his Steward might have need of help.
We own Cidhna Mine. Best prison in Skyrim, and source of half the wealth in this city.
We keep the Reach safe. We flood Markarth with wealth, but does the Jarl listen to us when we want a say? No.
He's busy forgetting that Ulfric Stormcloak saved this city from the Forsworn. Ulfric's a hero, not a damn criminal.
We're nothing to the Daedra. Pawns to move around, praise, and punish as they see fit.
The College would agree with you, but do you have any idea how many innocent lives were cut short, just so Azura could have revenge?
Well, now that you mention it, there is something I've been trying to get my hands on.
When the colossus struck, Grimsever was knocked from my grasp and I was wounded badly.
I must have collapsed, because the next thing I remember is Aerin standing over me tending to my wounds.
I was adventuring in the depths of the ruins when I was attacked by a massive construct... like nothing I had ever seen.
It was only through blind luck that I was able to crawl away from the Dwemer abomination and make my way to the surface.
Yes. If you were ready, of course. Are you familiar with how marriage works in Skyrim?
Ah, so the Brotherhood has come for old Hern, has it? Well then, let us meet as equals.
Aha! I knew you could do it! I just knew it! I knew the Dark Brotherhood would save me!
Here, just like I promised. This should fetch you a nice price. And thank you. Thank you again.
Both of the buildings are connected by tunnels made by the pests infesting the meadery.
I've already removed the boards so the meadery would get infested. That's where you should start.
There's an entrance to it in the basement storeroom of the warehouse that used to be boarded over.
By the Hist, if I don't get something soon, I don't know how I'll get through the week.
Clamoring in angry voices, calling out for justice, for war, they sat me on the throne.
My father, the great Bear of Eastmarch, died during my imprisonment after the Markarth Incident.
The Throne of Ysgramor! The throne of my father...  I only hope I can prove worthy of the honor.
When finally set free, I returned to Windhelm, and was greeted by a city in mourning, at one with my own grief and anger.
I, his only son, forced to deliver his eulogy via a letter I had smuggled out of prison. Such is the love of Titus Mede for his subjects.
Do I look like a guide? Only thing I do is sell meat. Now, are you going to buy or not?
For the first time in a long while, I truly believe that there are brighter days ahead.
Still, having a just and honorable man like Brunwulf in charge can only be an improvement.
Well, not yet. The Empire hasn't been in charge for that long, and real change takes time.
Unlike Ulfric, Brunwulf has shown a great willingness to work with the other races and make us feel more at home here.
Gallus, Mercer Frey and I were once members of what's known as the Nightingale Trinity.
The Trinity disbanded twenty-five years ago when Mercer Frey betrayed us by slaying Gallus and dumping his body in the ruins of Snow Veil Sanctum.
Ha! We'll see about that. This is a special brew, very strong stuff. Let's get started.
How did you manage to damage it, then? This is what I get for not retrieving it myself.
This... it matches every description of the Phial that I've found in lore. But if it can't hold liquid, there's no way of knowing.
I believe once it's interred with my father's remains I'll be at peace with his memory.
I'd like to make the journey to the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm and give my ceremonial dagger to Andurs, the caretaker.
I didn't say I wouldn't fight the giant. I just said you're going to help me get to it.
Meet me outside Fallowstone Cave. You clear the way to the giant for me, and I'll make sure you get paid for it.
Thanks to you, I've just been issued a challenge in front of my whole tribe, by a Daedric Prince, no less. I can't ignore that.
I have taught the Way of the Voice for centuries and the Thu'um since long before that.
I meditate on the Rotmulaag - the Words of Power. I counsel in their use. It is enough for me.
But no, Dovahkiin. Others do not come here to train anymore. Saraan. You are the first in over a hundred years.
I heard a scream and came running, but she was already... like this... when I got here.
I hope so. The Legion is Skyrim's only hope right now. Come on, we'd better get moving.
I sell my catch across a good portion of Skyrim... it's worth its weight in gold to me.
If you're headed that way, I would appreciate you delivering a purchase agreement for me. You'd be paid, of course.
The only untapped market left is Markarth. However, I just got word that Kleppr at The Silver Blood Inn might be interested.
I understand. Hopefully I'll be able to save my meager earnings up to buy them one day.
I'm glad to know that, because I need your help. You see, I've lost something precious.
It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't even make sense.
Sorry. Talking about the Scrolls, you usually end up in irritating and vague metaphors like that. Some people who study them devoutly go mad.
The Scrolls exist here, with us, but also beyond and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance so we could know them.
Live in my tower, roost in my home. Mix pretty poisons and collect shiny eyeballs, yes.
Maybe you can help me. You know, by way of making amends for getting me into this mess.
Trying to stay alive. I think time's running out though. I'm pretty sure the Thalmor know where I am.
No doubt she's convinced you that she's the victim. But, do you know why we pursue her?
Did she appeal to your sense of honor? Your greed? A more... base need, perhaps? It doesn't matter.
Of course, sent by... what is it that she's calling herself these days? Shazra? Saadia? One of those, correct?
Nords have always supported the Empire, and the Empire has always been good for Skyrim.
But was it worth tearing Skyrim apart, and maybe destroying the Empire? No, Ulfric will have a lot to answer for in the end.
I just hope the war doesn't come to Riverwood. There's enough trouble in the world without those Stormcloaks stirring up more.
People are rightly stirred up about the damn Thalmor being allowed to roam around arresting people, just for worshipping Talos.
Now get going before Sabjorn grows a brain and hires someone else to do the dirty work.
Maven and I spent weeks planning this. All we need is someone like you to get in there and get it done.
Oh, very good. Very good indeed. You, my dear, are going to fit in here quite nicely...
Oh, yes. Weylin. Bastard could have at least gone crazy after we made our silver quota.
That is the truth, my friend! Maven is a saint and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
The rumors were true... I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it.
The Unholy Matron, the Shrouded Lady, the Mistress of the Void. She goes by many names.
Today, she's... well, she's a skeleton. An ancient corpse. But, more importantly, a corpse that's being brought to this Sanctuary by her Keeper.
Ages past, Sithis gave a woman five children. She killed them to win his favor, thus becoming the Night Mother. If you believe that sort of thing.
The way our crops have been growing, Rorikstead must have the richest soil in the hold.
Maybe we should start selling the soil along with the dung. We could make a tidy profit.
Hey, people have paid money for stranger things. Take our cow dung - we sell that by the wagon load.
Hah! Who in their right mind would pay for dirt? You'd get laughed out of Whiterun for even trying it.
When you're rich, you can waste as much money as you like on far-fetched business ideas. In the meantime, there's a farm to run.
This is your last warning, outsider. We keep the peace, here. Stay out of our business.
Those who worship at the shrines will sometimes receive boons from the gods themselves.
The nature of the favors varies per deity. Please, feel free to worship at any or all of the shrines.
Unbelievable! You have done us a great service here. I can't begin to thank you enough.
What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?
I have overcome my nature only through meditation and long study of the Way of the Voice.
No day goes by where I am not tempted to return to my inborn nature. Zin krif horvut se suleyk.
I can be trusted. I know this. But they do not. Onikaan ni ov dovah. It is always wise to mistrust a dovah.
Dov wahlaan fah rel. We were made to dominate. The will to power is in our blood. You feel it in yourself, do you not?
Who sent you? Was it the College? The Jarl? We agreed there would be no more questions.
Whoa, there. I don't know where you're going, but stay out of that mine. It isn't safe.
You have my gratitude. That spider had been interfering with my excavations for months.
As promised, here's the key to the Dwemer Museum. Mind the displays. Some of them are quite fragile.
You're our favorite kind of traveler, then. The market area is just inside in the gate.
Your actions here were a disgrace. You betrayed your oath to the Emperor at every turn.
Actually, that's when she politely asked me to hand over my coin purse. Can you imagine?
We scuffled for a while, broke each other's weapons, and finally fell to the ground exhausted.
All right. If I make it back to Windhelm, I'll make sure Ulfric knows how you helped me.
Skyrim needs people like you, if we ever hope to regain our freedom from the damned Empire. Good luck.
Arnbjorn is safe, and for that you have my thanks. But what of the fool? Is Cicero dead?
Aye, I suspected as much but I've never been able to catch that little sneak with proof.
But never mind all that. We've got a job to do, and nothing's going to stand in our way.
Damn right it has. Demand's never been so high, at least not since I built the new mill.
Details, details. The Sanguine Rose breaks all the time and is fixed with but a thought.
In fact, here it is now. Think of it - a never-ending stream of minions. And all of the prestige of being Sanguine's chosen.
Don't fool yourself. It's only a matter of time before you people are run out of Riften.
Drem. All in good time. First, a question for you. Why do you want to learn this Thu'um?
Even when you get to the last sip in your flagon, it'll taste just as good as the first!
Lady Maven's been developing the secret recipe for Black-Briar Mead over the last several decades.
She uses a very secret blend of spices, fresh honey from Goldenglow Estate and specially constructed aging casks to ensure the best flavor.
Find the three vessels within Valthume, then return to me. With these we can defeat him.
Go away! I don't know who you are, but this is my spot! Whatever's on that ship is mine!
Good. I lost more than a few acquaintances to the Falmer and I wish to see them avenged.
He's a fool. A dragon has attacked Helgen. Dawnstar needs the Empire now more than ever.
Skald supports Ulfric's rebellion, and he doesn't like having a couple of old Legionnaires living in his town.
Hmm. Well, if that's what the Greybeards told you, I confess I don't have a better plan.
So little is known about the Elder Scrolls, almost anything is possible where they're concerned. Artifacts of truly inconceivable power.
I believe I was put here to protect this place from the darkness that pervades Solitude.
All my life. I practically grew up in the Hall. My father and mother were the priest and priestess of Arkay before me, you see.
I fought in the Great War. I cut enough young lives short, I'm not going to do it again.
If you could call it that. The Jarl can make all the demands in the world, I'm not setting one foot on the battlefield.
I like your fire, though. You'll make a fierce Companion. Let us hunt together sometime.
Woah, ease up there. We're rough, but there's no need to kill a Shield-Brother over a dispute.
I must have misheard you. I thought you asked me to help you trap a dragon in my palace.
I see. It probably doesn't even matter now, what with the mess that's been made in here.
I'll add this to the rest of the items. I don't think there's anything further I need from you.
I'll tell you who I don't envy - those poor children who lost their parents in this war.
I was lucky. If you hadn't rescued me, I'd probably be a thief, a mercenary or something even worse.
It's too fine a day to dwell on such things. Let's get back to work and forget about wars and orphans for awhile.
Another fine day at work in the fields. I don't envy those city folk who miss out on the joys of working the land.
Lives lost, crops burned, land ruined... there's no greater sin than war. And yet, you were an orphan, and you've made something of your life.
I'm a pirate, sweetie. Assassination attempts are an occupational hazard. Now, shall we?
The Dark Brotherhood? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You think this is the first contract I've had on my life?
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around the Pale.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around the Rift.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Whiterun.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Eastmarch.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Falkreath.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Haafingar.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around the Reach.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Hjaalmarch.
I've caught wind that one of the brighter Silver Hand has been sniffing around Winterhold.
I've heard Jaree-Ra is hanging around the Wells District, looking for new blood to hire.
If Vokun is as powerful as I think, I may need a little help um ... dealing ...with him.
If you do this, if you kill the Emperor... Oh, how the masses will fear and respect you.
Oh, my furtive friend. When Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, there will be gold... a fortune in gold. But so much more!
It is said that the Dark Brotherhood, in recent years, has been in decline. That you lack the power, wealth, and respect of days past. Is it not so?
Ironically, I pointed him in the same direction I pointed you. To Markarth and Calcelmo.
I'm only hoping whatever means he used to learn the language will still be available to you.
It was difficult at first. The Nords of this city are, at best, suspicious of outsiders.
But in time, I made the right friends and proved myself useful enough that they don't give me trouble anymore.
The dark elves are too proud and naive to understand the way things truly are, and so they continue to dwell in that slum.
It was the Forsworn from Broken Tower. Never been much trouble before. What's it to you?
It's good to see a fresh face. You wouldn't have happen to come from Whiterun would you?
It's held many names: Dagger of the Final Wounds, Bane of the Righteous, the Kingslayer.
The Mythic Dawn worshipped Dagon as a god. Having his Razor would be invaluable to my collection.
The Razor is Mehrunes Dagon's personal artifact. It has always heralded bloody change and carnage.
It's right there in the name of the most powerful family in Markarth. The Silver-Bloods.
I work for them. The inn is named after them. When the guards make an arrest, they check with them first.
They have a whole mine filled with prisoners to dig up silver ore, gets smelted by workers they pay, and they own half the city.
It's the whole reason Ulfric revolted against the Empire. Well, the first reason anyway.
Pity no one told the Elves. Whole group of those Thalmor came and they demanded Ulfric's arrest.
Forsworn had taken over Markarth, and Ulfric and his men drove them out. Empire promised they'd be free to worship Talos afterwards.
It's worth quite a bit actually. Quite a catch! Here you go, this should make you smile.
Look at that. I've told you to watch your tongue and mine is waggling. I've said enough.
Let's just say the headsman's axe may not be the worst way for a Solitude Jail prisoner to die.
My master has abandoned me! Abandoned his people. And nothing I say can change his mind.
Now he refuses to even see me. He says I interrupt his vacation! It's been so many years... Won't you please help?
Without his guidance, our homeland is falling apart. North wages war against south! The holy flame flickers and dies! We need his return.
Oh, but... I'm sure he'll repay you when he comes to his senses! His favor is a powerful, powerful thing. And so very worth any... inconveniences.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about returning to the ancestral home of my people.
Still, even with the rough treatment we've had at the hands of Ulfric and his lot, I've got ties here.
It's probably more trouble to pack up and leave than it is to stay. Besides, Ambarys can't run the cornerclub on his own.
Sweet Breath of Arkay, were these the cannibals that were plaguing the Hall of the Dead?
That attitude would get you far, if you were some stuffy merchant or a Jarl's footstool.
Around here, you'll want to learn to live your own life. Remember, nobody rules anybody in the Companions.
The Empire may have been good for Skyrim once upon a time, but those days are long past.
I've got enough to worry about, taking care of my family. I don't concern myself with such matters.
I'm glad Ralof is helping drive them out of here. If I was a bit younger, I might have joined the fight myself.
Banning the worship of Talos was the last straw. Thalmor everywhere, dragging people off for honoring our own gods!
The Jarl has put out a bounty on Forsworn. Here, take a look at this decree for details.
The job pays well, so I hope I can make arrangements soon. We could really use the gold.
There's a fine line between respect and boot-licking, new blood. But I like your spirit.
We've decided this will be your Trial. Do well, and you'll be counted among the Companions.
We were betrayed by one of our own kind. In fact, I'm to blame for what's happened here.
We're the ruling body of the Aldmeri Dominion. Saviors of Mer. Victors of the Great War.
The Empire exists because we allow it to exist, and I'm here to make sure the Jarl of Markarth remembers that.
Well, I don't know. Not yet... it flew over the town and landed on the old dragon mound!
What's done is done. Here, I want you to have this. Bringing me closure was kind of you.
I've been a fool, wasting my time sitting here helpless when I could have sent help sooner. Perhaps this is all my doing...
When Elgrim said we were setting up shop down here, I told him he would catch his death.
The dirt, the moisture... it's disgusting. Who wants to spend their life living like a skeever?
But that old bellyacher just fed me some nonsense about light ruining his mixtures and being close to the water... agh.
Who I am really isn't as important as what I am. And what I am is an admirer. Of sorts.
Yeah, but you're into gold. Let me know if you change your mind. I'm not going anywhere.
You are eager to begin your adventure. Excellent. The sooner begun, the sooner done, eh?
You are hereby dishonorably dismissed and removed from the rolls of the Imperial Legion.
You consider Restoration a valid school of magic, worthy of study, don't you? Don't you?
You'd better remember her right fast, before I call the guards and have you hauled away.
Is that so? Does the name Gleda ring a bell? The star beauty of my farm? Kidnapped by a drunk lout and sold to a Giant?
You'd do well to get out of here before I change my mind and have you locked in irons...
You've got no idea. Half the men in Whiterun have proposed to me. Some were even single.
They'll never understand. No amount of flowers or honeyed words are going to change my mind.
Right now, all that matters is my daughter Mila. No man's going to get between me and my little girl.
A few years back, I commissioned a unique quill from a good friend of mine in Winterhold.
Vald was tasked with getting it here safely and it ended up at the bottom of Lake Honrich.
Again? He can't simply cancel an appointment with the Jarl! He serves in my capital city!
I'm afraid he can. His authority comes from the emperor. Who you also serve, technically.
I'm afraid he's had to reschedule, my grace. By all accounts, waging war takes his every moment.
He uses all of Haafingar's resources, and doesn't answer to me in the slightest? This hardly seems fair.
Steward, when is my appointment to meet with General Tullius? There are some issues we must speak about.
[QUOTE]Fair[QUOTE] is a word rarely applied to politics, my grace. I'm afraid you must learn to accept this.
Ah yes, excellent samples. Thank you. This coin should compensate you for all the bother.
Been a while since I've seen one of those. What you've got there is a Stone of Barenziah.
Breathe deep, mortal. I would have you hear me well, so let these vapors fill your lungs.
Colette has already told you. You must be tested before knowledge can be imparted to you.
Degaine the beggar got himself kicked out the Temple of Dibella. Caused quite the ruckus.
Did you see a hound on the road? A fine, strong creature that's been wandering near town.
Even the Imperials might eventually decide to patrol their perimeter. Get yourself ready!
Have you met Grisvar the Unlucky? He's rightly named, and he's also a thief and a snitch.
He's outlived his minor usefulness. Take care of him, and then we can leave Cidhna Mine for good.
Help me down, and I'll show you. You won't believe the power the Nords have hidden there.
Yes, the claw. I know how it works. The claw, the markings, the door in the Hall of Stories. I know how they all fit together!
Here, take him this letter. I may not be as eloquent as he is, but I hope he understands.
Clearly. I've never even thought of him in that manner. I wish that I was as skilled with words as he.
Here, take this Grand Soul Gem, fill it for me, and bring it right back. I'll be waiting.
His name is Torsten Cruel-Sea. He's really rich, 'cause he owns a farm called Hollyfrost.
But I don't want to be a sailor or a farmer. I want to be a warrior! The strongest one ever!
His name was Torsten Cruel-Sea. He was really rich, 'cause he owned a whole farm called Hollyfrost.
He told me once that he wanted me to grow up and be a sailor, 'cause that's where our family name comes from.
Hmm, yes. But your su'um is strong. I do not doubt that you can convince him of the need.
However, don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.
Don't dismiss our adversary so easily. They're well-funded, patient and have been able to avoid identification for years.
I dare say the Guild owes its survival as much to my family as it does to its own people.
The Black-Briar family has always been allied with the Guild. Our connections with the Empire and within Skyrim make for a perfect fit.
I heard a rumor that these bandits were ransoming captives, so I thought she may be here.
I see. Well, perhaps you'll take pity on a humble priest who has lost something precious.
I'm on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Azura, the Goddess of Twilight. If you'll excuse me.
I've been following him for months now. Well, not actually following. Trying to find him.
The guards won't help. The people won't help. I'm the only one who thinks he can be caught.
If I was Maven, I'd blame the Guild for weakening and not being able to handle the place.
If the owner cuts the Guild out of the picture, he's cutting Maven out of the picture... which she can't afford.
Maven Black-Briar needs Goldenglow's honey for her mead. She's been using the Guild to keep the Estate under her thumb.
In this business we rarely deal in names; our identity comes from how much coin we carry.
It became clear they're trying to hoard powerful artifacts, looking to consolidate power.
Mages based out of Cyrodiil. They fancy themselves the Imperial Authority on magic these last few hundred years.
I was quite surprised to find them on our doorstep. They seemed amiable enough, but their line of questioning made me... uneasy.
My understanding is that all they really do is make noise in an attempt to curry favor from the Emperor. Lots of politics, little magic.
Light armor for scouting detail, heavy armor for full on combat, or something in between?
Name's Angi and if you try anything stupid I won't hesitate to put in arrow in your head.
No, no. That's the beauty of the whole plan. We're going to get Sabjorn to give it to us.
The meadery has quite a pest problem and the whole city knows about it. Pest poison and mead don't mix well, you know what I mean?
Now, I have a soul in Oblivion to claim. Take care of the house while I'm gone. Ha ha ha!
Know your place, mortal. Or Molag Bal may just send another champion to claim his mace from your broken corpse.
Oh that is exciting! I'm sure the court and the Jarl will love it. I'm writing it in now.
No, that's pushing it too far. Very exciting but highly unlikely, I can't possibly write that in.
Oh, but I suppose you expect some compensation. Um... here, these potions should suffice.
Ah, splendid, splendid. It's for a special brew I'm working on. A love elixir like none other.
Ah, splendid, splendid. It's for a special brew I'm working on. A love elixir like none other. Maybe I'll test it on Farengar first...
Say, that's not a bad idea. You look like you could handle yourself against these beasts.
She's as stubborn as she is beautiful, isn't she? Glad you found a way to get her to pay.
Haelga is a devout follower of Dibella and dotes over the statue to the Divine that she keeps at the Bunkhouse. Use it as leverage and she'll cave.
Silus comes from one of the oldest families in Dawnstar. They have a complicated history.
Several of his ancestors belonged to the Mythic Dawn, the cult that almost destroyed Tamriel.
And now Silus is back and this museum to the Mythic Dawn is his way of trying to rebuild his family's pride. It's misguided.
His family's involvement was only found out well after the crisis had died down, but it still ruined their reputation. They were outcasts.
Then we should soon be selling arrows by the bushel. A sword is no good against a dragon.
Then, maybe a few years ago, it all stopped. He didn't even bother to contact us anymore.
Gulum-Ei started to get greedy and cut us out of the deal. Almost can't say I blame the scaly bastard.
It started out innocent enough; he kept claiming the shipments were light because of Imperial interference.
These old ruins... My father always told me to stay away from them. Good advice, I'd say.
We haven't been expecting you, and the old man needs his rest. Come back some other time.
We spoke the traditional words of greeting to a Dragonborn who has accepted our guidance.
The same words were used to greet the young Talos, when he came to High Hrothgar, before he became the Emperor Tiber Septim.
Which means you don't remember losing your temper and throwing trash all over the temple.
I'm guessing you also don't remember coming in here and blathering incoherently about marriage or a goat.
Yes. For matters of such gravity, we need to know where you stand. Or who you stand with.
And let me guess, that someone is my so-called husband Leigelf? Well the feeling's mutual.
Authorities? Have you been listening to what I said? They're all dirty. Every one of them.
The only way to get things done in this city is to keep your head down and pay off the right people.
But these Forsworn. They're nothing like the men I cobbled together. They're real killers.
Guards brought me in about 12 years ago. Was running a good group of bandits up until then.
Can't say I ever much liked the idea of the Empire telling us what to do an' how to do it.
Pleased enough, I suppose. At least they appreciate the ways and traditions of the Nord people.
Elsweyr is an arid land of deserts and rocky canyons, where the sun shines warmly, always.
There are cities so ancient, the sands have swallowed them whole. But now I will say no more, for I miss my home greatly.
The Khajiit hail from a distant land called Elsweyr, bordered on the north by Cyrodiil and the south by the glistening blue waters of the sea.
Faralda. Don't act like she didn't say anything. I know her, I know what she's been up to.
Good enough. We'll meet up near the watchtower. Don't take any chances until we get there.
Good to hear. You can be a difficult man to find. Thankfully those couriers are tenacious.
Good to hear. You can be a difficult woman to find. Thankfully those couriers are tenacious.
Her name's Olda. If you've met her, then you probably already know what I'm talking about.
I swear that woman is the most spiteful shrew in all Skyrim. I think there's a chunk of ice where her heart ought to be.
Here's the gold I promised. Keep following the trail and there will be more in it for you.
So the clues point to the Treasury House, then. That makes sense. Thonar is involved in every facet of the city.
Hey there! Check out what my friend and I found. I'll sell some of it to you, if you want!
Hey, remember that girl, Eisa? The one who sliced open that pickpocket they threw in here?
The Blackblood girl? Now there was a fighter. If I didn't know better, I'd say she was a Forsworn woman.
Hmph. Fine. Go on in. But don't try anything in there. Madanach knows more than you think.
The only thing Madanach expects is a bottle of Skooma in tribute every so often. You're not getting through.
Horses are my whole life. Back in Hammerfell, I helped my family raise horses at our farm.
I hope to open my own stables one day, but I think it's going to take a lot longer than I expected.
Yes. Hofgrir took me in when I arrived in Riften about a year ago. He's been teaching me everything he knows.
I can't afford to appear weak. I can't agree to this unless Tullius himself will be there.
I have the greatest respect for the Greybeards, of course. And the dragon attacks are a growing plague.
But the political situation is still delicate. Not all the Jarls are fully committed to supporting me as High King.
I do hope you still have the Staff of Magnus someplace. I suspect you're going to need it.
It would seem there's some sort of disturbance. From what few details we were given, it sounds quite familiar.
There's another report of a disturbance in that Hold. Best if it's taken care of before things get out of hand.
There's another report of a disturbance in this Hold. Best if it's taken care of before things get out of hand.
I suspect that the power released by the Eye of Magnus was not fully contained, and has coalesced in this part of Skyrim.
I picked up a trick from a butcher in Elinhir, a small town over the border in Hammerfell.
I'm always looking to replenish my supply, so if you ever come across five of them, I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands.
He showed me a way to grind up ice wraith teeth and use it as a preservative. Keeps everything cold and fresh, but only for a limited time.
I understand. Speaking to a goddess is overwhelming for many. Return when you're prepared.
I wish we could offer more help, but our last attack went sour and we're all that is left.
If you have the guts to head into the Ratway and get my bow back, I'll pay you what I can.
A few days ago, some thieves from Riften broke in here and stole it! Can you imagine? Took the only thing of value we had.
If you wish to stand alone, so be it. If you wish for our help, you'll answer my question.
In the end, vampirism would endanger my ward Agni which would defeat the intended purpose.
I met several of your kind during my studies of life-extending magics. I even  considered becoming a vampire myself.
It seems that a predator has invaded their home, and someone needs to clear the beast out.
My Amulet of Arkay. It's the source of my divine powers and also a sacred badge of office.
Without that amulet, I'm powerless to confront them. Would you be willing to search for it?
I misplaced it in the catacombs. I'd look for it, but I've been hearing noises down there. I fear the dead have become... restless.
Now Sapphire wants her money back, and if I don't pay her, I think she's going to kill me.
I borrowed some gold from Sapphire to pay for the shipment, but it got robbed before it even arrived.
I was able to work out a deal with the stables in Whiterun to sell me some of their tack and harnesses.
Oh, you can save your sinister bravado. I'll not go to my grave whimpering like an infant.
I know why you're here. I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is.
So now I'm all alone. And the Jarl said I had to go to Honorhall Orphanage. It's not fair!
She got sick, last winter, when the snows came. And she just... she never got better. Not all year. One night she fell asleep and...  never woke up.
Sure, sure. It's just, you know, not every day I meet someone who's laid eyes on a dragon.
That's a shame. Too many people in Riften share your view and look where its getting them.
It's going to take more than just myself and Aerin to help this city... it has to want to help itself first.
The Guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly.
The Nightingales protect the temple of Nocturnal, a place known as the Twilight Sepulcher.
The vapors are waning, but not yet gone. Take a breath. Peryite will speak if He sees fit.
This looks good. You put time into your blades, they'll serve you well when you need them.
You want to keep helping? How about you make some armor? Let's start by tanning some leather on the rack.
To guide its people through this time of transition, to help lead them to a better future.
Now that stability has been established between the Dominion and the Empire, we seek only to help Skyrim.
Torsten was gratified the death of his daughter was avenged and the heirloom was returned.
At this very moment, he's layin' the groundwork for the Guild to reestablish itself in Windhelm.
I wished you could have sent more of a message to those Summerset Shadows upstarts, but hopefully they'll stay out of our business.
Burnin' that banner was a nice touch, too. Should send a clear message to the Summerset Shadows that we're a force to be reckoned with.
We made a pact that one day, we might reunite... but I believe that day is long in coming.
I didn't have a choice. When the Red Mountain erupted in Morrowind, the Tong fled... spread to the nine winds.
Well, nothing. At least not any more. Folk just call me that because of what I used to do.
I was a sailor for many a year. I made my coin as a trader and in time, I bought my own ship.
When I retired here in Windhelm, most folk already knew me as Captain Lonely-Gale, and the name just stuck.
Well, suffice to say she is resplendent, but not without resolve. Striking, in all senses.
Wonderful. Soon we'll have the latest section of the Edda complete. Keep up the good work.
That's it! You've collected every last verse. I can't thank you enough. This deserves a special bonus.
You don't want to be part of history? Fine. I'll be at the shrine if you change your mind.
You went right out to give it to your fiancee! Don't you even remember where you left her?
You went right out to give it to your fiancee! Don't you even remember where you left him?
And after you told me that sweet story of how you met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why he left you.
And after you told me that sweet story of how you met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why she left you.
You, too, huh? I'd much rather a straight up fight than creeping around a place like this.
You've done me a great service, my friend. Allow me to compensate you for the information.
This key opens one of my stashes in the basement of the meadery. Help yourself to any of its contents.
At the same time, this tether will bolster the agent's own life force, making him stronger.
This Agent of Strife can send forth a tendril of pure darkness into the heart of another, causing great injury to them.
Don't miss out... purchase a bottle of my genuine Falmerblood Elixir! Only 20 septims each!
Genuine Falmerblood Elixir for sale! Live for thousands of years... see into other people's thoughts!
Learn a library's worth of knowledge in moments or grow back that missing limb with my genuine Falmerblood Elixir!
Make love like a sabercat or crush your enemies to dust like a giant! Only a mere 20 gold coins and all this could be yours!
Don't take too long figuring it out. Might mistake your hesitation for Imperial sympathies.
Come back when you're committed to the cause, or go join the Legion. They're taking anyone with a pulse these days.
Each bolt of yarn used to make the robe was colored with a dye made from sacrificial blood.
Feel free to look around. Come talk to me when you're ready to discuss that job I mentioned.
The Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes were written by the Mythic Dawn cult leader, Mankar Camoran.
He promised a paradise awaited his followers when they died, that they would be reborn by Mehrunes Dagon's side.
The tapestries hung here and outside were found in hideouts where members of the Mythic Dawn would meet and plot.
The cult's greatest accomplishment was the assassination of the Septim Dynasty and the opening of the Oblivion Gates.
It's said that Mankar Camoran used the book to open a portal to a Paradise where all his followers would live forever.
That burned paper is all that remains of the fabled Mysterium Xarxes. The blasphemous book written by Mehrunes Dagon himself.
Those robes were worn during the Mythic Dawn's secret meetings, where they plotted to bring the Daedra Mehrunes Dagon into Tamriel.
Ah, yes. That scabbard. Notice the insignia? An Oblivion Gate. A key symbol of Mehrunes Dagon, the patron Daedra of the Mythic Dawn.
Good, the place is crawling with bandits.  We lost some good men trying to take it earlier.
I am loath to utter his name... one cannot erase a thing if it has a name to be remembered.
I could easily provide my spells to your cause. Protect you from harm. Defeat your enemies.
I was a sorceress of no small skill before I came into Azura's faith. Afterwards, her magic sustained me.
I never knew much about Weylin, except he lives in the Warrens, like all the other workers.
He was one of the smelter workers. I used to have a job down there myself, casting silver ingots.
I suppose that'll do. Dibella teaches us forgiveness, after all. Even for a drunk like you.
I surrender! Give me a few hours to gather my household, and I'll depart. You have my word.
I was kidnapped by these bandits weeks ago. They locked me up in the towers near Mistwatch.
I won't be the one to go back there. I won't return to Avanchnzel. You can't make me do it.
I'm afraid not. How else can a poor, overworked sailor like myself expect to earn a living?
Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lad. This will be a fight to remember!
Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lass. This will be a fight to remember!
I've been pouring over the plans you brought us, and I'm convinced the Eyes of the Falmer are in the dwarven ruins at Irkngthand.
Lazy good-for-nothing, isn't he? Sent you down here when I'm a stone's throw from the keep?
Here's the sword. Tell Harrald to stop slaying walls and perhaps his blade will stay in better condition!
Lore holds that the Skull of Corruption holds a constant hunger for the memories of others.
What it does with these memories is just conjecture and an argument for scholars and historians to this very day.
The Skull has been out of touch for so long, I fear it's gained the ability to reach out on its own and try to feed.
Mother thought I should be taught a lesson for airing the family's dirty laundry in public.
I mean, I've... taken care of many people for her in the past. What in Oblivion did she expect me to do?
Ah well. At least I have all the comforts of home during my stay. Well, except the touch of a woman of course.
My choice, then? Very well. I think we should add some Chaurus eggs. For additional flavor.
Nothing. I'm busy, and I don't like being bothered unless I'm expecting something from you.
Oh, don't give me that look. Fine. I supposed I can find some menial task to set your mind on. Hmm....
We have something of a vampire problem. Bodies have been found with blood drained. I know of a den nearby you can wipe out as a precaution.
Oh, the Listener, well... listens! The Night Mother speaks to you. Guides you on your path.
But when the Night Mother speaks, the Listener must obey. You must! For her word is the will of Sithis. And Sithis is the Dark Brotherhood incarnate.
See, I knew we could resolve this civilly. A debt owed must be repaid. You understand that.
Well, get to it then. Pick your guest, and send the poor fool to the Void.  I'll give you the key to this shack, and you'll be on your way.
Something's happening to bring the dragons back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.
Soul gems are the subject, friend. They're used in enchanting, then they break. Except one.
Spare me your pitiful pride. You are but a tool of my ambitions, mortal. Never forget that.
Steal from anywhere in the hold, and you even get to keep everythin' you stole. So, you in?
Of course. Don't forget to keep out of sight, it doesn't count if they catch you red-handed. You ready?
I always have bedlam jobs. Just remember to hit them fast and don't let them see you. Feel like going for it?
Taking an easy job, eh? Well, go and do some damage. Just stick to the shadows and keep out of sight. Want to go for it?
Simple right? Almost. The catch is it doesn't count if anyone sees you take it. The message needs to be clear; we work in the shadows.
Sometimes we like to remind a city that we mean business, so we hit it hard. Just steal whatever we can until we've made an impression.
Tacitus? Boy's an Imperial. I keep showing him how to treat the iron, but he never gets it.
In the Legion, the Imperial smiths used to read books when they couldn't set their hammers straight. Wisdom of the old, I guess.
If you find a book called [QUOTE]The Last Scabbard of Akrash,[QUOTE] could you bring it to me? Tacitus sure isn't learning by example.
That sounds precisely like the sort of thing that should matter to everyone. Especially me.
Something was discovered in Saarthal that was significant enough that Tolfdir sent a new member of the College, alone, to deliver word.
The quill was supposed to allow me to duplicate any writing I'm viewing in exacting detail.
I'm sure you can understand how useful that would prove in a business situation, especially where signatures were involved.
They're built like small fortresses to resist the weather, but their one weakness is flame.
Besides, nothing tells the people of Riften we mean business better than a huge column of smoke.
This isn't a damn summer picnic! Hurry up. We need to hit them before they know we're here.
Ugh. You're the most disgusting merchant I have ever seen. The guards should take you away.
What do I do to deserve such hatred? You give people good food and good prices, and all they do is insult you.
The only people I offend are cheats who don't pay me enough gold coin, or idiots who don't know good meat when I throw it at their faces.
If you ever think of throwing meat at me, I will have you dragged off to Cidhna Mine so fast the guards will yank those filthy arms of yours off.
Well... you did show remarkable initiative. And you didn't have to bring the crown to me...
You can prove your new allegiance to me, by delivering an important message to the Jarl of Whiterun.
But let me warn you - joining the Legion is for life. Any previous loyalties... I trust we understand each other.
Why didn't you say so earlier? At least now we don't have to waste time searching the area.
Would you mind helping me with the demonstration? Are you at all familiar with ward spells?
Yes. Perhaps one day I'll be able to make the journey, but for now I need to tend the dead.
You best rethink this course of action or you may find yourself on the executioner's block.
Do you realize that at a snap of my fingers I can bring the entire Markarth city guard to my defense?
You don't have to say sorry to me. I just hope the Eight bring us more peace in the future.
You should think harder on your oath to the Emperor next time you're deciding what's right.
I'm sure that will be comforting to your comrades that gave their lives for the territory you just handed to Ulfric.
You there. We are looking for someone in Whiterun, and will pay good money for information.
You would violate this marvel of Kynareth's glory to fix that half-breed stump in Whiterun?
That's abominable. Barbaric. I'll have no part of this. Why didn't you tell me what you intended?
You're... probably right. Just hurry, please. Who knows what those things are doing to her.
Ah yes, quite an amusing anecdote actually. I caught him trying to break into my laboratory.
I was about to show him the error of his ways when he made a curiously astute comment about my research notes.
I was astounded and in turn it lead to a conversation. Who'd have imagined it would lead to such a strong friendship?
Alduin's Wall was created by the ancient Akaviri Dragonguard, the forerunners of the Blades.
One of the lost secrets of the Blades. Where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy.
Its location was lost for centuries, but I know where it is: Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden within the crags of the Reach.
All he found in my pocket was a tiny smooth stone inscribed with some sort of strange runes.
My father told me he found me as a young boy in the wreckage of a ship that sank off of the coast near Solitude.
An excellent question. Vittoria Vici is the first cousin to our dear Emperor, Titus Mede II.
Vici has obvious Imperial connections. Her husband has ties to the Stormcloaks. Their union is a step toward reconciliation.
So if there's a murder at the wedding... Not only will it stall the peace process - it will send shockwaves throughout the entire Empire.
The Emperor's hand will be forced. He'll have to travel to Skyrim to deal with the aftermath... and he'll find the Dark Brotherhood waiting.
Azura has seen your coming, traveler. It was not curiosity, but fate, that has led you here.
Beggars roam the streets, crime runs rampant and the threat of war is driving away business.
The paltry amount of coin that I place in the charity box at the temple is the least I can do to help.
