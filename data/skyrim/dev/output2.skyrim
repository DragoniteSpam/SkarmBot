Keep walking.
Hhhhhhhaaaaaa!
Make me proud.
Hey, Unblooded.
Talos keep you.
Aaaaaahhhhaaaaa!
I feel so alive!
Glad you're here.
Go with the Nine.
Fight or die well.
Rrrraaaaaaggghhhh!
Get over to Riften.
Hhhhhhuuuuuuaaaaaa!
Keep your guard up.
This should be fun.
You're still alive?
Yyyyrrrraaaaahhhhh!
Don't screw this up.
Get over to Morthal.
Step aside, citizen.
We sure showed them!
Yyyyyeeeaaaaahhhhhh!
Focus on the mission.
Get over to Dawnstar.
Get over to Markarth.
Get over to Whiterun.
So what's your story?
Stay sharp out there.
You have been warned.
Yyyyyyyaaaaaahhhhhhh!
Get over to Falkreath.
How'd you end up here?
May the gods keep you.
Wwwwwwrrrraaaaaahhhhh!
Damn Stormcloak rebels.
Get over to Winterhold.
You're going to Riften.
Get over to the capital.
Damn faithless Imperials.
We all have faith in you.
What do you want with us?
You're going to the fort.
You're headed to Morthal.
Good. Don't die out there.
Hhhhhuuuuuzzzzzaaaaahhhhh!
Huh. I had heard you died.
Stormblade. It's an honor.
You're headed to Dawnstar.
You're headed to Markarth.
You're headed to Whiterun.
Get down to the front line.
You're headed to Falkreath.
Are you looking for a fight?
Go home and lock your doors.
Next Imperial I see is dead.
Soon. I can almost taste it.
You're going to Fort Kastav.
You're headed to Winterhold.
You're going to Fort Dunstad.
You're going to Fort Neugrad.
You're going to Fort Sungard.
You're headed to the capital.
You're going to Fort Greymoor.
You're going to Fort Snowhawk.
Your objective is Fort Kastav.
Have you always been that ugly?
Pleasant weather for a war, no?
You're going to Fort Greenwall.
Your objective is Fort Dunstad.
Your objective is Fort Neugrad.
Your objective is Fort Sungard.
I'm a true Nord. Simple as that.
If it isn't Ice-Veins. Hi there.
You leave me no choice, citizen.
Your objective is Fort Greymoor.
Your objective is Fort Snowhawk.
Good. Make it it happen, soldier.
This doesn't concern you, friend.
What do you say? Can you do this?
What? Now's not the time to chat.
Your objective is Fort Greenwall.
Gah! Let's get on with it already!
Here. Take this for your trouble.
Imperial business. Be on your way.
Not sure you belong here, citizen.
Please! Have mercy... I beg you...
That's what I keep telling myself.
So, why'd you join the Stormcloaks?
Straight to business with you, huh?
What are your thoughts on all this?
Can't wait to kill another Imperial.
Fine. Have it you way. A fight it is.
I knew I could count on you, soldier.
So why'd you join up with the Legion?
Can't wait to gut one of those rebels.
Citizens! Go home and lock your doors!
Excellent. These should come in handy.
I'm not sure if that's a good thing...
This is none of your concern, citizen.
Well, soldier? Are you up to the task?
Your objective is the enemy held fort.
We destroyed those Stormcloak traitors!
And sabotage enemy controlled resources.
The waiting... the insufferable waiting.
Good job out there. Glad you were with us.
Do the men you killed haunt you? Mine do...
One way or another, get me those documents.
Can't wait to kill another of Ulfric's boys.
I need you to create some chaos in the hold.
Show the rebels the futility of their cause.
Thanks. Couldn't have done that without you.
That went pretty well, all things considered.
Do the men you've killed haunt you? Mine do...
Don't make me tell you again. Get out of here.
Think you might be in the wrong place, friend.
Well, well. Look who it is! How have you been?
But never mind all that. We've got a job to do.
Get down there and join Rikke on the front line.
They'll never suspect an attack from the inside.
What are you people doing outside? Go home. Now!
Who do you think killed more rebels? You? Or me?
Wouldn't want to sully his reputation, would we?
Alright, if it's a fight you want. You've got it.
But don't do anything rash if you go to Windhelm.
Get down there and join Galmar on the front line.
We're not quite ready to muster the final attack.
I warned you. You leave me no choice but violence.
That's what I wanted to hear. Good luck out there.
They won't be expecting an attack from the inside.
Are your ears still ringing? I hope that goes away.
Get over to Riften. We're mounting our final attack!
I suppose you're right... they say it gets easier...
Get over to Morthal. We're mounting our final attack!
Who do you think's killed more Imperials? You? Or me?
But never mind all that. What brings you out this way?
Get over to Dawnstar. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Markarth. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Whiterun. We're mounting our final attack!
Get over to Windhelm. We're mounting our final attack!
We showed those Imperials what real Nords are made of!
But, never mind all that. What brings you out this way?
By the Nine, I hate the waiting. The goddamned waiting.
Get over to Falkreath. We're mounting our final attack!
I'm pretty sure I killed more than you. I was counting.
Get over to Winterhold. We're mounting our final attack!
Keep an eye out for trouble. It's only a matter of time.
Get over to the capital! We're mounting our final attack!
Good. And remember - keep the gods, and they'll keep you.
I have to admit. This is more fun that I thought it'd be.
It's not safe out here! Return to your homes immediately!
Peace may yet return to Skyrim. But until then, we fight.
We'll show those faithless dogs who this land belongs to.
But, never mind all that. We've got a job to do. Don't we?
Gah. Let's do this already. I'm itching to kill something.
We sure showed them, eh? Thanks for your part in all that.
Set an ambush on the road between, or camp one of the inns.
You made it? I was sure I'd find you face down in the dirt.
Well, it just so happens I have the perfect mission for you.
They'll think twice before coming back here, that's for sure!
Excellent. Put the fear of the Nine into those motherless dogs.
Once you find the courier's route, kill him and take his place.
Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.
If you're planning violence against me or mine, you'll regret it.
Set an ambush along the road between, or camp by one of the inns.
You made it! I'm impressed. It was a gamble, but turned out well.
Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.
We do this for the good of Skyrim and her people. Never forget that.
The imperial butchers are on their way. Get home and lock your doors!
I would hate to think what would happen if this fell into enemy hands.
I wonder how many of us think we'll be the lucky ones and survive this?
If those rebels think they can best us, they have another think coming.
Do colors seem brighter to you? Everything seems bigger, too. Strange...
I don't want some snotty elf telling me what gods I can and can't worship.
[QUOTE]Dragonborn[QUOTE] huh? Was it your ma or your pa that was the dragon?
See if you can't [QUOTE]convince[QUOTE] one of those innkeepers to help you.
This won't be easy, but that's why I'm sending you. Think you can handle it?
Need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar.
The inns at Dragonbridge and Solitude are frequent stops for Imperial runners.
The Nightgate and Candlehearth inns are frequent stops for Stormcloak runners.
So, do you get that weird taste in your mouth before battle, too? What is that?
The Stormcloaks will be here any minute! Hurry! Get inside and lock your doors!
Citizen. You have been warned. You leave me no choice but to resort to violence.
The inns at Dragonbridge and Rorikstead are frequent stops for Imperial runners.
What's taking them so long? Did they get lost? Let's get this over with already.
Well? Where the hell are those damned Stormcloaks? Let's get this over with already.
This won't be easy. But that's why I'm sending you. You got the grit to get this done?
Citizen. I'm warning you. Your presence is interfering with Imperial business. Be gone!
And take out resources like sawmills, flour-mills, and smelters, with a little sabotage.
These are dark days. But at least we know we're doing our part to make things better, eh?
We understand the Nightgate and Roughwater inns are frequent stops for Stormcloak runners.
Find enemy controlled resources like sawmills, flour-mills, and smelters, and sabotage them.
The rebels are keeping some of our men prisoner there. I aim to turn that into an advantage.
I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun.
If you run across any enemy couriers, take them down, and bring me whatever they're carrying.
Can't wait to see the look on their faces when they find us here waiting to spill their blood.
I don't think Rikke even knows my name. Probably because I'm not [QUOTE]The Dragonborn.[QUOTE]
Search out enemy soldiers in the wilderness, or guarding towns and settlements, and kill them.
I don't think Galmar even knows my name. Probably because I'm not [QUOTE]The Dragonborn.[QUOTE]
What the rebels like to forget, is that the Empire's what's keeping the Dominion out of Skyrim.
As long as the rebels are willing to die fighting the Empire, we must be willing to oblige them.
My father was a Legionnaire, and his before him. I guess I never considered doing anything else.
Good work. Knowing more about the enemy's position makes it that much easier to take it from him.
I remember you... you were with us at Helgen, and Whiterun. Glad to have you with us. How are you?
My scouts tell me the inns at Dragonbridge and Rorikstead are frequent stops for Imperial runners.
And of course, they'll be caught off guard thinking we're off doing something altogether different.
I see. Well, make it quick, or do you have better things to do than fight for the people of Skyrim?
Bring whatever he's carrying to me, and I'll send you with convincing misinformation back to Dawnstar.
They have some of our boys locked up there. But with a little luck, we can turn that to our advantage.
Bring me whatever he's carrying, and I'll send you to Morthal with something convincing but full of lies.
I've heard some things about Ulfric I don't like, but he's right about this war and about Skyrim's future.
You know, some nights when I close my eyes, I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there...
And with the rebels thinking us occupied elsewhere for the time being, we'll be able to take them by surprise.
I need you to create some chaos in the hold so I can maneuver men into position without drawing too much attention.
I need you to find evidence of her corrupt activities, and use it to gain a measure of her [QUOTE]cooperation.[QUOTE]
I can't remember the last time I visited home. Think I've forgotten what a proper bed looks like, let alone feels like.
I've sent men to scout out the area. You are to meet them, find a way to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort.
I guess I'm doing all right. I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun.
You're alive! It was a gamble - but as Talos keeps us, we keep each other - I wasn't going to just let them rot in there.
My cousin disappeared one night. Some say the Thalmor grabbed him. It wasn't long before I found myself under Ulfric's banner.
Go in quiet, break our man out, then get out of there. Don't risk combat if you can avoid it. If you can't, then give 'em hell.
It just so happens, I've got some scouts along the road. Meet up with them, and together see if you can't overpower the caravan.
Meet the soldiers preparing for the attack. Then join them in wiping out the rebels. Once you prevail we will garrison the fort.
Well done, indeed. This will be of great service. Understanding the enemy's position makes us all the more equipped to usurp it.
I've sent some men to scout out the area. Meet them, see if you can't find a way to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort.
You gave those mongrels a real whipping, eh? Good work. We'll be sure to send a garrison to reinforce the area and keep the peace.
Meet the brothers preparing for the attack. Then join them in wiping out the Imperials. Once you prevail we will garrison the fort.
But, if confronted with proof of his belief, you might be able to [QUOTE]persuade[QUOTE] him to aid our cause, indirectly of course.
My spies report the Jarl's Steward, Anuriel, has arrangements with the Thieves Guild that would be rather embarrassing if made public.
Go quiet, break him out, then run. This isn't a suicide mission. Don't risk combat if you can avoid it. If you can't, then give 'em hell.
Ever wonder if maybe we should a call a truce with the Imperials and join forces for just a little while take care of some of these dragons?
Excellent! We've hit 'em where it hurts. Repairs will be needed when we take over, but at least the Stormcloaks won't benefit in the meantime.
Rumor has it the Jarl's Steward, Raerek, is a faithful Talos worshipper, if not a true son of Skyrim - he still supports the Empire, after all.
Ever wonder if maybe we should a call a truce with the Stormcloaks, join forces for just a little while, and take care of some of these dragons?
Ever get the impression Rikke's not always sure what side she's on? I'm not doubting her loyalty. Just, she seems rather sympathetic to the rebels.
I signed on 'cause I couldn't watch the Stormcloaks tearing everything apart and not do something. But, most of my family disagrees with my choice.
We hit 'em where it hurts. As soon as we can, we'll take over - make the needed repairs. In the meantime, the people no longer slave for the Empire.
I know it's what everyone says, [QUOTE]To go to new places and see the world.[QUOTE] But it's true in my case... I never bargained on seeing more than I liked.
Legate.
Tribune.
Praefect.
Quaestor.
Auxiliary.
Ice-Veins.
Unblooded.
Stormblade!
Stormblade.
Snow-Hammer.
Bone-Breaker.
Keep an eye out for Stormcloak spies.
Always good to see someone I can trust.
What I do, I do for Skyrim and her people.
The general expects so much with so little.
Ulfric... what have you done my old friend?
It's always good to see someone I can count on.
One lives for the things he is willing to die for.
Damnit! Why can't Ulfric see he's tearing Skyrim to pieces?
Sometimes I miss being out there in the middle of the action.
Stay alert. Never know when those Stormcloak dogs might charge.
That we have forgotten them, this I fear the gods will remember.
My hatred for the Empire is bested only by love for my countrymen.
What will Skyrim have become if her children submitted to tyranny?
General Tullius expects much of me, and thus I expect much of my men.
I'll fight the entire Legion myself if they dare show their faces here.
Been so long since I killed a Stormcloak, my sword arm's getting flabby.
I long to be out there, with my brothers, waging war against the Empire.
Sometimes I wonder if Ulfric understands what I'm dealing with out here.
The sooner we end this rebellion, the sooner I'll be able to sleep at night.
Sometimes I wonder if the gods have abandoned us... as we have abandoned them.
It was anger that brought each of us here, but it is love that keeps us fighting.
The Empire is weak. That is why we fight them. Skyrim must be ruled by the strong.
My hatred for the Empire is exceeded only by my hatred for their witch-elf puppet-masters.
Skyrim is the birth place of the Empire. We won't let a bunch of thugs rob her of her lineage.
On the coldest of nights, in the steam rising from my breath, I see the many faces of the dead.
In these grave times each Legionnaire must be his better self at all times and under all conditions.
That godless Emperor can shove his damn treaty into the steaming nether-reaches of my you-know-where.
Countless dead haunt countless sleepless nights... when Skyrim becomes whole again, perhaps so will I.
Legion soldiers gleam like fresh-fallen snow and clank like a kitchen. They head this way, we'll know it.
The Empire is man's last bastion. If Ulfric wasn't blinded by lust for power, he'd see we are on the same side.
Some say Ulfric desires to be king and nothing more... have they not seen that his anger floats on a sea of tears?
When we destroy the rebellion, perhaps the Thalmor will call off their damned inquisitions. It's just making things worse.
The measure of a man is taken at the moment of his death. And know this for truth, the ghosts of many heroes walk among us.
If there was someone else Ulfric could trust with all this planning nonsense, I'd be out there breaking heads with the rest of you.
When we've reclaimed our homeland from the Imperials, we'll take the fight to the Thalmor. They are the true enemy. Make no mistake.
The Emperor would turn Skyrim into a puppet of the Dominion. I for one would not care to dance for the amusement of those foul elves.
We stand out here in the cold, as brothers, warmed by the knowledge that we fight for the rights of every free citizen of the Empire.
I don't fight for the glory of the Empire, nor do I glory in the death of my kinsmen. I fight to bring peace and order to my homeland.
The Empire would have us become slaves to the Thalmor. We are not slaves. We are men. Free men who will slay anyone who begs to differ.
Before we wage war upon our foes, we must wage a war against our lesser selves. Cleave to your higher voice and with it shatter your foes.
The Empire would have us become their slaves as they have become slaves to the Thalmor. I will not live as a slave, nor will I die as one.
Every Legionnaire's secret weapon lies in this: knowledge of himself. And like any blade, he must be forged between the hammer and the anvil.
Stormcloaks... even the name of their rebellion stinks of Ulfric's vanity. He wants to be king. That's all this is about. One man's ambition.
Ulfric would expunge from Skyrim citizens whose only crime was to be born of a non-Nordic woman. That is unacceptable to free men everywhere.
Were the Stormcloaks to prevail in dismantling Imperial rule in Skyrim, who would be her protector? No. We will crush this rebellion. We must do.
Look deeply into the faces of the warriors around you. These are the true sons and daughters of Skyrim. See her strength and nobility in their eyes.
Lurbuk?
Fancies himself a bard. He pays, so I let him stay.
If I had any customers, I'd be worried about him annoying them. But, well... Look around.
Mmmhmm.
Another foul day at the smelter.
Sometimes I think we deserve these miserable lives of ours.
[QUOTE]Mmmhmm[QUOTE]? I've been working with you for over 10 years, and all you have to say is [QUOTE]mmmhmm[QUOTE]?
Mother!
So, what book should I read to you tonight?
How about [QUOTE]The Lusty Argonian Maid[QUOTE]?
You've got no sense of humor, you know that? Why don't you pick up where you left off with [QUOTE]The Real Barenziah.[QUOTE]
Mother?
Not now, Braith. Go... go ask your father.
I wanted to ask you something. It's about a boy...
Mutton.
Which, the mutton or the vegetable?
You ain't made me that stew in a long time.
Hmm. So I haven't. All right, I'll buy the ingredients tomorrow and we can have it for dinner.
Nahl...
Daal...Vus!
Ven Mul Riik!
Zu'u lost daal.
Kel drey ni viik.
Daar Lein los dii.
Di kiirre fen alok.
wordless yell of defiance
Zu'u ni faas gaaffesejul.
Face me, then! Zu'u Alduin!
Hin sil fen nahkip bahloki.
Fen du hin sille ko Sovngarde!
Zu'u unslaad! Zu'u nis oblaan!
Clear Skies - combine our Shouts!
Nust wo ni qiilaan fen kos duaan.
Again, together! Alduin is strong!
Dovahkiin, hin kah fen kos bonaar.
The mist is gone, my mind is clear.
We must clear this confounding mist.
We cannot fight the foe in this mist!
Pahlok joorre! Hin kah fen kos bonaar.
Again, as one! The World-Eater fears us!
Zu'u Alduin, zok sahrot do naan ko Lein.
I'll fight and die, if such fate is mine.
Now ends this tale, my eternity be damned!
His power crumbles - do not pause for breath!
We can shatter his power if we Shout together!
We're ready, Dragonborn, our wrath to unleash.
We must Shout together these shadows to dispel.
One more time, and the World-Eater must face us!
All hail the Dragonborn! Hail her with great praise!
All hail the Dragonborn! Hail him with great praise!
Does his strength have no end? Is our struggle in vain?
Dovahkiin, you should not have come here. Nu hin sil dii.
Zu'u lost kriaan hi ont, nu hin sille fen nahkip suleyki.
If it is our lot to end, we'll live in song if not in soul.
I have already defeated your friends once. Beyn. I do not fear them.
The endless wait gives way to battle! Alduin's doom, his death or ours!
No higher fate than fall in battle at Sovngarde's gates, a glorious end!
Before I fall, you'll feel the bite of my sharp blade, as Shor's my witness.
Better to die with blade in hand than feed his hunger, hopeless in the mist.
Stand fast! His strength is failing! Once more, and his might will be broken!
DO NOT RECORD - used as silent blocker for inappropriate dialogue in Sovngarde
You are persistent, Dovahkiin. Pruzah ol aar. A fine slave you would have made.
Again, and we break his grim hold over Shor's realm, and redeem it for eternity!
The eyes of Shor are upon you this day. Defeat Alduin, and destroy his soul-snare.
When you are ready to rejoin the living, just bid me so, and I will send you back.
They will sing of this battle in Shor's hall forever. But your fate lies elsewhere.
Alduin will hide in this lightless mist until we Shout together, and shatter his power.
To battle, my friends! The fields will echo with the clamor of war, our wills undaunted.
At Sovngarde's gates I'll meet my fate with mirthful heart, and know I fell in noblest cause.
This was a mighty deed! The doom of Alduin encompassed at last, and cleansed is Sovngarde of his evil snare.
Through fire and time, the terror has lived. No more, I say! I've set my heart on terrible deeds, death's grim art.
When you have completed your count of days, I may welcome you again, with glad friendship, and bid you join the blessed feasting.
No one.
You'll never see the sun again, you hear me? No one escapes Cidhna Mine.
Oh, no.
No there isn't. And I suggest you leave it at that. I don't want to see anyone get hurt over this.
Dagur's been talking at you, hasn't he? Gotten you roped into his little plan to fix Ranmir's life?
I'll tell you what I told him -- stay out of it. It's none of your business. Those aren't folks you want to get tangled up with.
Orgnar!
Orgnar.
Hard not to.
Did you hear me?
Are you listening?
Yep. Ale's going bad.
I'm just the cook, lad.
Outta my way, stranger.
I'm just the cook, lass.
By Shor, what do you want?
You lookin' for a new blade?
Need a room, talk to Delphine.
I ain't lookin' to make friends.
Food's hot. Never said it was good.
You look like you could use an ale.
Ah, everybody around here's so serious.
You like Skeever liver. No? Tough luck.
So I like to have a little fun, so what?
You're that visitor, been pokin' around.
A new face. And a right fair one at that.
Some day I'm going to forge my own sword!
You're kinda fuzzy. What's wrong with ya?
Ain't used to strangers here in Riverwood.
Maybe you've already met Camilla Valerius?
The war keeps most folks away, these days.
So what's your story? Just here to... relax?
Well... I'll let you go about your business.
Ain't every day we get visitors in Riverwood.
Alvor and I, we got a daughter. Little Dorthe.
My girl likes to work the forge with her papa.
We carry just about anything you could need...
We work hard, try to do right by our families.
At least the damned war hasn't gotten here. Yet.
I'm spoken for, you know. So don't get any ideas.
Maybe you're looking for something... particular?
My sister Camilla or I will be happy to help you.
The ale is going bad. We need to get a new batch.
Ain't nothin' a boy can do that I can't do better.
If you're staying the night, I've got a free room.
Only worry we've got is the war reaching this far.
We don't get a lot of travelers here in Riverwood.
You're a strapping young man. Don't be a stranger.
You're not from around here. That makes two of us.
Nobody believes me, but I tell you, I saw a dragon!
A new face. And a right ugly one at that. No offence.
I raised my Sven to be strong, and proud. A true Nord.
Maybe I'll do turnips next. Hmmm... Or maybe radishes?
Get me mad, and I'll prank ya. And not a little. A lot.
I miss Valenwood, but the wilds here are... serviceable.
Some day Camilla will know of my affections. Some day...
I'm composing a new song. A ballad, for Camilla Valerius.
Wanderer like you must have quite an appetite. Some food?
It don't matter what I grow - my Alvor, he'll eat anything.
There's beauty here unmatched in all of Skyrim, to be sure.
Papa may have wanted a son, but he got me. He's a lucky man.
Riverwood's agreeable enough, I suppose. For a Nord village.
Got business here in Riverwood, eh? There are worse villages.
You gotta have better things to do than talk to me all day...
If only Camilla shared my affections. Or even knew about them.
Woodcutting's my trade. Best log splitter from here to Riften.
I'm the innkeeper. It's my business to keep track of strangers.
The Riverwood Trader is everything you need in a general store.
The thought of my wood being used for weapons... Makes me sick.
Mother wants me to work at the mill. But I ain't nobody's slave.
I just want to find a good husband, and start a family of my own.
Now you, lass... You've got some beautiful trunks yourself... Hmm?
Papa says I'm too friendly with strangers, but you seem all right.
We're a small village, but we work hard, and take care of our own.
We got rooms and food. Drink, too. I cook. Ain't much else to tell.
You the sneaky type? Got some nice daggers around here somewhere...
Dorthe needs to spend more time in the garden. I could use the help.
Greetings, sister Elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home.
Greetings, brother Elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home.
My boy fancies that Camilla Valerius. She'll come around soon enough.
New to Riverwood? If you're looking for work, go see Hod at the mill.
No use thinkin' of things I can't change. Too much work to be done...
I came here from the Imperial Province, to work with my brother Lucan.
Most of my customers are locals, come to relax after a hard day's toil.
Whatever you need. By Ysmir, if it's simple and strong, I can forge it.
Mama doesn't think I'm girlish enough. But that's just stupid girl talk.
The men here like my attention, and I like theirs. Best know your place.
You're pretty, I'll give ya that. Just stay away from my husband, Alvor.
I work at the lumber mill, but I escape into the forest whenever possible.
Iron or steel is what you need. Leave that fancy Elven stuff to the Elves.
Me, I've got my axe, my wife Gerdur and my boy Frodnar. That's all I need.
My father is Alvor, the blacksmith. I'm his assistant. I mean, apprentice.
Sven has the voice of a snow lark. Only good thing he got from his father.
I came to Skyrim looking for a better life. So what did I get? Another war.
It got bad back in Cyrodiil. The war with the Thalmor ruined... everything.
I could forge you a warhammer that would crush a giant's head like a walnut.
You're new around here, so I'll go easy on ya. But don't get on my bad side.
It's my boy Sven you need to listen to. He sings at the inn, most every night.
Papa says I'm not ready for weapons. So I make lots of horseshoes and hobnails.
All of that blacksmithing... It's not good for a little girl. Ain't... ladylike.
You met Camilla yet? Wouldn't mind getting my hands on those trunks. He he he he.
Are you a hunter, by chance? The hills surrounding the village are ripe with game.
I know some of it looks like junk, but everything's a treasure in the right light.
I've been trained as a skald, as was my father, and my father's father before him.
He would dote on her so much. Let her work the forge and everything. I miss him so.
You look like a traveler. Someone that has seen far away places and heard new stories.
My time at the Bards College was brief. A prodigy has little need for formal education.
I don't like to brag, but I once took down a bear at three hundred yards. In a blizzard.
It's all in the way you hold the axe. Caress it, like any wench, and she'll do ya right.
What happened to my Skyrim? Everywhere you look, cats, lizards and elves. It's sickening.
I own the lumber mill, and pay a fair wage. See my husband Hod if you're looking for work.
Camilla, I've seen her talking to that Faendal. Filthy elf needs to keep to his own kind...
Years past, the lumber was used for houses or furniture. Now, the soldiers just buy it all.
Iron and steel mostly. I might even have some of your fancy Elven pieces lying around somewhere...
You should come hear me play at the Sleeping Giant Inn. For a small sum you can even pick the song.
I guess you don't have potatoes in your ears after all. Just make sure we get a fresh batch in soon.
My friend Dorthe doesn't like my pranking. [QUOTE]You're being mean, Frodnar![QUOTE] So what if I am?
Did I see you talking to Sven? Maybe not. Maybe...nevermind. But I would stay away from him if I were you.
Really?
Glad to hear it, Aia.
Thanks, Aia. That means a lot.
You know, my father collected exotic alcohols.
Rum from Hammerfell, mulled wine from Daggerfall and the like.
None of what he collected tasted as good as your Spiced Wine, Evette.
I'm still finding your Spiced Wine to be the best drink I've ever tasted.
Sister.
Brother.
Have fun!
Stay safe.
Hello, tidbit.
Later, ham hock.
Oh, hello hello!
Yeah, good luck.
Greetings, sister.
Darkness guide you.
Farewell, farewell!
Greetings, brother.
Greetings, Listener!
Have a good contract.
Kill well, and often.
Kill well. And often.
Until next time, sister.
Until next time, brother.
Oh, yes. Goodbye, goodbye.
Represent us well, sister.
Go. Do what has to be done.
Represent us well, brother.
Cicero bids you... farewell.
How may I serve the Listener?
What do you want, beef roast?
Burn that little jester alive.
Take care of yourself, beef roast.
May the shroud of death embrace you.
Sithis' whisper be upon you, sister.
Walk always in the shadow of Sithis.
Boy, did you miss all the excitement.
Sithis' whisper be upon you, brother.
Go, incinerate some poor bastard for me.
Just come back alive, and I'll be happy.
Go on now. Time to get your hands bloody.
Remember, fireballs. You can never go wrong.
It only hurts when I laugh. He he he. Owww...
I believed in Cicero. But he's betrayed us all.
You require the services of the Fool of Hearts?
Remember, when you kill - we all wield the blade.
Death is but the time to sleep forever, in the Void.
I'll give you a week before you end up dead in a ditch.
Can't wait to hear all about the next person you murder.
Nobody ever expects a fireball from the darkened corner.
I could brew some potions for you. Or train you in Alchemy.
I serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary. Life is simple, and good.
It was a truly terrifying scene. Beautiful, in some respects.
Yeah, yeah. Goodbye, kill lots of people, Hail Sithis, and all that.
You just trust in Astrid, follow her orders, and you'll do fine here.
It's been quite a boon, looking like a child. No one ever suspects a thing.
You're part of a family now, hamshank. I trust you... you trust me. Got it?
Talk to Babette about potions. She's the creepy little girl - can't miss her.
In the Dark Brotherhood, I found acceptance, love, and my life's true purpose.
The Shadowscales are all but forgotten. An ancient tradition, from another time.
You looking to buy some potions? Or maybe I could help train you to make your own?
You certainly have a strange energy about you. I look forward to following your progress.
My targets make the mistake of not perceiving me as a threat. Last mistake they ever make.
You like creepin' around in the shadows? Magic'll work just as good there as anywhere else.
Don't take offense to the nicknames, morsel. I'm a werewolf. Hard not to think of you as a snack.
You're going to love it here. We have a lot of fun, and we look out for each other. Just like any family.
Yes, yes. I'm your brother and I'm supposed to greet you respectfully. So [QUOTE]hello.[QUOTE] There, satisfied?
Ah, you're back. It was good to fight alongside you. I'm sure people won't be forgetting that wedding anytime soon, hmm?
There's too much of an obsession these days with knives and arrows. You can kill someone just as easily with a well-placed spell.
Me, I have been part of the Dark Brotherhood from the day I first hatched. I am a Shadowscale, you see. Born under the sign of the Shadow.
Don't let my appearance throw you off. I'm older than you. A lot older. Getting bitten by a vampire when you're ten will do that to a girl.
Let me guess - Astrid failed to mention I'm her husband? She has a tendency to do that. Doesn't want the others thinking she plays favorites.
Does death not come to us all? Is it not a certainty? I am, therefore, honored to be doom's herald. To play some part in a being's inevitable end.
So? So?
Yeah. So?
Yes, son. We should try to capture it.
Oh. Okay. So we should try to... what? Capture it?
I tell you? Saw that wild mare again yesterday, just outside the walls.
Shor's beard, boy! You forget where you're standing? What kind o' business we're running?
We manage to break that mare and bring her back here, we can sell her for a small fortune.
Thanks!
All right!
Last but not least. Let's go!
Let's teach these bastards a lesson.
Thanks.
Wait...
Prepare yourself.
It's just up here.
Enough of your lies!
Follow me, it's this way.
I... I will. Thank you...
No thanks to you, Casimir.
I call upon you, Lady Mara!
Then you leave me no choice!
Veren... Thorek... you're alive!
I hope the tome we need is still intact.
First, an incantation to remove the barrier.
Give me just a moment, and I'll have this open.
No. I... I was scared. I wasn't ready to sleep.
Give him a chance to speak. He's trying to help us.
I can't allow you to destroy the Skull, Priest of Mara.
I no longer use that name. I'm Erandur, Priest of Mara.
Now I can show you the source of the nightmares. Over here.
It's a curse! It has to be! I've got to get out of this town.
Behold the Skull of Corruption, the source of Dawnstar's woes.
Everyone, please. I'm doing what I can to end these nightmares.
Be careful... we're certain to find more of the awakened within.
Beyond these doors is the inner sanctum and the Skull of Corruption.
The Skull hungers. It yearns for memories and leaves nightmares in its wake.
You're a traitor. You left us to die and then ran before the Miasma took you.
Irgnir, get a hold of yourself. They're just dreams. Please tell her, Erandur.
We must reach the inner sanctum and destroy it. Come, there's no time to lose.
In the meantime all I ask is you remain strong and put your trust in Lady Mara.
The temple's been abandoned for decades now. Ironic isn't it... a ruin within a ruin?
It's the same dream over and over again. You think that's normal? It's evil I tell you!
The tower on that hill is our destination. People around here call it the Tower of the Dawn.
Grant me the power to break through this barrier and to send the Skull to the depths of Oblivion!
Listen to your friend, Fruki. They are just dreams, my dear. I assure you that it is quite normal.
This library used to be filled with arcane volumes. Now look at it; almost everything's been burned.
Erandur, she has a point. You keep telling us no harm will follow these dreams, but they must be an omen.
It feels good to finally have a chance to help these people. Helplessly watching them suffer's been difficult.
Perhaps my prayers were answered and your reason for stumbling across Dawnstar is more than a mere coincidence.
When the temple was active the priests would rarely be seen in Dawnstar. They preferred to live a solitary existence.
There's a small shrine to Mara I established inside the tower's entry hall. I was hoping to seek spiritual guidance from Her.
I'm not familiar with the tower's history, but it was deserted for quite a long time before Nightcaller Temple was established inside.
Yeargh!
Shadows fall!
Shadows take you!
Your end is near!
Glory to Nocturnal!
Submit to Her will!
Darkness destroy you!
I'll bury you in darkness!
Yessir!
Yes, mum!
No problem.
Keep your scales on.
Look alive, will you!
Saadia, wake up dear!
Frabbi, a customer needs a drink!
Too lazy to give him a drink yourself? Oaf.
Come on in. We got warm food, warm drinks, and warm beds.
Lynly, would you mind taking care of the customer please?
Come on in. Just stoked the fire. Take a seat and get the cold out.
Hey, Talen... get off your lazy tail and take care of the customer!
If you've got the coin, you've come to the right place. Pull up a seat.
Ah, a visitor. Old Hroldan Inn has hundreds of years of history, friend.
Come on in. The Silver-Blood Inn has plenty of strong drink and clean rooms.
Welcome to the Vilemyr Inn. If there's anything I can get you, just let me know.
Welcome. Let me know if you want anything... think I got a clean mug around here somewhere.
Come on in. Let me know if you need anything, or take a seat by the fire and I'll send someone over.
Finally, someone comes in. Kick off your boots, stay awhile. Let me know if there's anything I can help you with. I got nothing but time these days.
(Crying)
Aaaaagh!
Wait, come back!
Where are you going? Come back!
So long [QUOTE]friend.[QUOTE] Ha ha ha!
Where are you... get me down from this!
Sorry, but I have a treasure to get to...
Cut me down, or you'll never get the claw!
Amusing.
Are you?
Well. I'm afraid I can't help you with that. I need the crystal to do anything useful, and I don't have it.
As am I.
As for myself, I've always been content to simply be an alchemist.
You acted very nobly in helping my master realize his life's work. Thank you for that.
I fear keeping the Phial would just remind me of Nurelion's obsession, and how it consumed him.
Here, keep it. You are as much a part of its legend now as Curalmil was. I hope it brings you the happiness that my master desired.
At last.
The child is spirited, but lacks... agency.
I've been waiting for someone more fit to carry out my will.
Beem-Ja!
Would you look at that!
Beem! What are you doing?
Hush, Salma. We aren't alone.
This is it! Gathrik awaits us!
That's done it! Let's get in there.
This is it. We've found Gathrik's tomb.
Well? There must be a way through. Look around.
Don't rush ahead. This is a trap if I ever saw one.
We must gather our strength. Who knows what's inside?
Oh, Beem-Ja. I never meant for this. What have I done?
How can you just sit here and wait? We should be in there!
You can't shake us off that easily. Let's see what's here!
Treasure, that's what! Get off your scaly rump and let's go.
What are you on about? Let's just get the treasure here and go.
But why?
Quiet down.
I'm waiting.
Please! Help me!
Do we have a deal?
Stop your whining.
Don't leave me here!
I, uhh... wait, what?
Out of the way, meat.
Why did I ever come here?
I've got to get out of here.
No, no! This is the wrong way!
How could you just leave me here?
Please, please let me out of here!
You have what you came for. Now leave.
Really, I think there's been a mistake.
She said you stay in there, and that's final.
All right, that's enough. Back to bed, please.
Well, everything worked out nicely, didn't it?
He gets the books, I get you. It's very simple.
She gets the books, I get you. It's very simple.
Take your books and go, before I change my mind.
Well, you're certainly making a name for yourself.
I still don't see why we had to bring it back here.
Just let me out of here. I only wanted to help you!
Urag can be very helpful. Just don't antagonize him.
May I just speak with her, please, to clear all this up?
The Arch-Mage believed it important. It must be powerful.
The undercroft is ahead... ugh, Necromancers. Be careful.
The library is just through here. We're getting close now.
I'll give you something to cry about if you don't quiet down.
All right, that's enough. Let's return to our business please.
This thing from Saarthal. What does it do? J'zargo cannot say.
I understand you're the one that found this... Orb in Saarthal.
You have to let me out. They're going to do something awful to me!
Okay, now can you let me out? Please? I won't tell anyone it was you.
You wouldn't do that, would you? You wouldn't leave me here with her!
We need to go upstairs, that's where she is! That's where the books are!
We don't know that. We don't even know what it is. Where is Aren, anyway?
In his quarters, with that Thalmor, Ancano. Something urgent, it sounded like.
There's a lever, right there in the center. Hurry, before more of them show up!
We shouldn't have been disturbing Saarthal, no matter what you found down there.
Just open the cage, and I'll leave quietly. Won't make a sound, won't bother you at all.
At least something good came out of that trip to Saarthal. I didn't find anything but dust.
I hear you found some... thing in Saarthal. You think it could help make me a powerful mage?
This little adventure of yours has cost me a number of test subjects. I need more, and you'll do nicely.
By whom?
Were you now?
Wrong on all accounts, aren't I?
Wait! Don't tell me! I want to guess!
Because that's... crazy. You do realize who you're dealing with here?
Ha! No matter! Honestly, I don't want to know. Why ruin the surprise?
But more to the point. Do you - tiny, puny, expendable little mortal - actually think you can convince me to leave?
Was it Molag? No, no... Little Tim, the toymaker's son? The ghost of King Lysandus? Or was it... Yes! Stanley, that talking grapefruit from Passwall.
Charmed.
I prefer a good roast duck. But your soup will do.
The Gourmet. Leave it to Titus to spare no expense.
I've been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.
You're not at all what I expected. I imagined you'd be fatter, honestly.
You've done your duty and we're all very grateful. Now... I'd like to eat.
So glad we kept you in Skyrim. Serving your Emperor was worth the wait, of course.
Citizen.
Trouble?
Werewolf!
Hail, Companion.
No lollygaggin'.
What is it, Elf?
What is it, Orc?
Don't cross me, Elf.
What is it, Khajiit?
What is it? Dragons?
Everything all right?
Staying safe, I hope?
What is it, Argonian?
What is it, Imperial?
What is it, Redguard?
What do you need, bard?
All hail the Dragonborn!
What do you want... cat?
Stay out of trouble, Elf.
Stay out of trouble, Orc.
Stay out of trouble, Nord.
That is one... big hammer.
Watch the skies, traveler.
Stay out of trouble, lizard.
Stay out of trouble, Khajiit.
How can I help a brother Nord?
Stay out of trouble, Argonian.
Stay out of trouble, Imperial.
Stay out of trouble, Redguard.
By the gods! It... it can't be!
Hands to yourself, sneak thief.
Sheathe those claws, Khajiit...
Staying out of trouble, kinsman?
It's a werewolf! To arms! To arms!
The Thu'um! He summons the Thu'um!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch the magic!
The Thu'um! She summons the Thu'um!
Yes, Dovahkiin? How can I help you?
You put those Forsworn down. Good job.
I find your wolfish grin... unsettling.
Go cast your fancy magic someplace else.
Honored Companion. How can I assist you?
I know your kind, always sneaking about.
Is that... fur? Coming out of your ears?
Gods damn those Forsworn. So many dead...
Heard about you and your honeyed words...
Keep your arrows in their quiver, archer.
Bit late to be wandering around, isn't it?
By the gods! What manner of power is that?
By Ysmir, you did it. You killed a dragon.
Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me.
Best offense is a good defense, am I right?
Favor the bow, eh? I'm a sword man, myself.
No.. get that accursed mace away from me...
Psst. Hey, I know who you are. Hail Sithis.
Who did you have to kill to get that blade?
Could sure use a warm bed right about now...
No more nightmares. Thank the gods for that.
You wear that Stormcloak armor well, friend.
Ebony armor. By Ysmir, 'tis a wondrous sight.
The Imperials think we need their laws. Pfft.
Let me guess - someone stole your sweetroll...
What manner of staff is that? Such a horror...
That Stormcloak armor's getting on my nerves...
You wear the garb of a true Nord. I salute you.
Lightly armored means light on your feet. Smart.
That mace... get it away from me. Get it away...
The Gildergreen blooms again. All thanks to you.
That's some fine Imperial armor you've got there.
Whatever you need, Dragonborn. Just say the word.
You're the one casts those illusions. Impressive.
Ugh. Your breath is foul. What've you been eating?
You're that one from the College. Heard about you.
Iron sword, huh? What are you killing, butterflies?
So Madanach was behind those murders. Gods help us.
That's fine scale armor you've got on there. Shiny.
You're the one saved the Fire Festival. I remember.
Ah, steel plate. Now that's a solid choice of armor.
Hail, summoner. Conjure me up a warm bed, would you?
Hey, you mix potions, right? Can you brew me an ale?
It is the power of old! The Voice of the Dragonborn!
The Gildergreen will bloom again. All thanks to you.
I was this close to catching that killer. I swear it.
Fine armor you've got there. Dwarven make, am I right?
In the ancient tongue, you are Dovahkiin - Dragonborn!
It's too bad they executed Roggvir before we got here.
Uch. Been tending your hounds? You smell like wet dog.
I find your hand in my pocket, I'm going to cut it off.
You wear the armor of a mercenary. Now that's the life.
Just a few more hours and I can crawl under some furs...
Ugh. That armor stinks of death. You been grave robbing?
You wear the armor of the bear, my friend. A fine choice.
Aye, now that's some fine armor. Good old-fashioned steel.
Helgen... destroyed by a dragon. Hard to believe, isn't it?
If those Whiterun guards can take down a dragon, so can we.
You come up to me, fists raised? You looking for a beating?
Ah, now that's a fine shield. And not mere Dwarven... is it?
I fear the night. Because the werewolves and vampires don't.
So you can cast a few spells. Am I supposed to be impressed?
That iron sword's pretty undependable. You should try steel.
There are stories about you, and dark tidings in Dawnstar...
Thanks for clearing out that vampire nest. You saved Morthal.
Why the Elven blade, hmm? Nord steel not good enough for you?
You couldn't possibly be the Dragonborn of legend. Could you?
You have the Jarl's confidence, friend. And so you have mine.
I know you had some part in Sinding's escape. Don't deny it...
I'd be a lot warmer and a lot happier with a bellyful of mead...
My cousin's out fighting dragons, and what do I get? Guard duty.
You dare strut around here, wearing that filthy Stormcloak hide?
You're like me, eh? Don't fancy those clunky two-handed weapons.
Favor a steel sword, do ya? Good choice for slashing or stabbing.
That's good armor you've got there, friend. Iron, solid and true.
You hear that? I swear, there's something out there. In the dark.
Guard might get nervous, a man approaches with his weapon drawn...
Thalmor in the Ratway? What's next, Spriggans in the Bee and Barb?
Aye, now that there's a beautiful sword. Like a sliver of midnight.
Destruction magic's fine, just don't go burning down any buildings.
Fancy the leather armor, huh? Something to be said for going light.
Fancy yourself an alchemist, hmm? Never could get the hang of that.
What do you aim to do with that hammer, friend? Knock down a house?
You wield... Azura's Star? How... how can such a thing be possible?
Guard might get nervous, a woman approaches with her weapon drawn...
I know Thieves Guild armor when I see it. You're not fooling anyone.
I'm telling you, I heard it. Howling. Those werewolf tales are true.
Gotta keep my eyes open. Damned dragons could swoop down at any time.
Only burglars and vampires creep around after dark. So which are you?
The people here are still plagued with nightmares. It's... unnatural.
You did this city a great service by catching that killer. Well done.
For a dragon to attack Kynesgrove... Why? Why there? Is no place safe?
So you bought Vlindrel Hall, eh? Wish I could afford a house that nice.
That armor... it's like nothing I've ever seen. Like forged midnight...
What a foul and unnatural weapon you wield. Never have I seen its like.
You come talking to me wearing Imperial armor? You got stew for brains?
Your shield... Dwarf-make, is it not? But yet it seems so much... more.
For your sake, I hope your took that armor from a dead Imperial scout...
Got to thinking, maybe I'm the Dragonborn, and I just don't know it yet.
I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee...
The Imperials think us all lawless beasts. I'm proof of their ignorance.
You wear the armor of a brigand. Best not cause any trouble on my watch.
Brigands I can handle, but this talk of dragons? World's gone mad, I say.
Judging by your armor, I'd say you're an Imperial scout. If so, well met.
A truce? With the Imperials? They'll murder us all, first chance they get.
Have you heard? There's been another dragon attack. Kynesgrove, this time.
If we killed a dragon once, we can do it again. With your help, of course.
Smart thing you did, buying Honeyside. Nice place, and why pay for an inn?
There's a dragon. Here. In Dragonsreach. And I thought it was just a name.
You own Proudspire Manor, hmm? Beautiful house. At least from the outside.
Don't suppose you'd enchant my sword? Dull old blade can barely cut butter.
Go fiddling with any locks around here, we're going to have a real problem.
Heard about what you did. Killing those foul witches. Well done, Companion.
I know of your deeds, and am honored to address a member of the Companions.
Pigsticker like that's not going to get you far. Best visit the blacksmith.
Releasing a captured dragon. I don't think I'll ever understand that one...
Don't think you can barter with me like I'm one of those damned shopkeepers.
Some advice, friend. That armor won't offer much protection in a real fight.
Your name's been cleared... by Thonar Silver-Blood. Consider yourself lucky.
I caught a glimpse of that captured dragon. It's.. beautiful. In its own way.
It ain't true what they say about you and... and the Dark Brotherhood? Is it?
Trapping a dragon in Dragonsreach. Damn clever idea you had, I have to admit.
By all I hold sacred... that's a Shout! Like the Graybeards on their mountain!
I've seen you helping the Jarl. If only all visitors to Whiterun were as noble.
I've a lot of respect for the Restoration School. Skyrim could use more healers.
We may guard Whiterun, but the Thieves Guild guards us. If you know what I mean.
You're that one lives in Breezehome, right? Fine place. Almost bought it myself.
If it isn't the slayer of the Glenmoril Witches. How can I assist you, Companion?
Takes a fair bit of strength to carry a greatsword like that. But can you use it?
The Emperor's cousin, killed. Right here in Solitude. I feel nothing but shame...
With Nurelion gone, I suppose Quintus has taken over business in the White Phial.
You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords.
The Emperor of Skyrim. Dead. These are dark times, my friend. Dark times, indeed...
You... you're the Harbinger. Of the Companions. It is my honor to stand before you.
Wonder what it's like for those Thalmor, now that they've been taken down a notch...
Don't think you'll get special treatment just because you have a house in the city...
That armor... Are you one of the Emperor's protectors? Can't say I envy you that job.
They say Helgen got hit by a dragon. One of those horrors comes here, we'll be ready.
We had that beast contained. And you released it! Why? Why would you do such a thing?
We'll protect Erikur as best we're able, but I fear the throne of Solitude is cursed.
Word is the College of Mages is back to normal. If there's such a thing for that lot.
You ask me, those brats in the orphanage are better off, now that old Grelod is dead.
Imagine, blowing up an entire town. Damn College... Winterhold will never be the same.
Kodlak killed, Jorrvaskr attacked. How could this happen, within the walls of Whiterun?
The gods gave you two hands, and you use them both for your weapon. I can respect that.
They say Ulfric Stormcloak murdered the High King... with his voice! Shouted him apart!
If I'd been on guard at the Thalmor Embassy, wouldn't nobody be disturbing that party...
Ain't no doubt about it. The Thieves Guild is back, and they've got Riften in their grip.
Is your armor made of... dragon bones? By the gods, what I wouldn't do for a set of that.
Kodlak White-Mane is in a better place now. For is there any place better than Sovngarde?
Now I remember - you're that new member of the Companions. So you, what - fetch the mead?
Orcish armor, hmm? Had me a set of that once. Ugly and strong, like those that forged it.
The damned nightmares have finally stopped. Don't suppose you'd know anything about that?
The guards in Dragonsreach say you've aided the Jarl. On behalf of Whiterun, I thank you.
Is your armor made of... dragon scales? By the gods, what I wouldn't do for a set of that.
That armor... Are you one of the Emperor's protectors? Not very good at your job, are you?
You're that Mage from the College. Right? Hear things have finally calmed down over there.
By Shor, is that... is that Azura's Star? How did you come to possess such a rare treasure?
No matter what else happens, the guards will always be grateful for everything you've done.
Solitude wouldn't be the same without the Fire Festival. City owes you a debt of gratitude.
You... you were talking to that murderous savage. And then he escaped. What are you hiding?
A change has swept into Solitude, like a breeze off the ocean - the Thieves Guild has come...
You have vanquished a great evil from Skyrim. You have saved this land... and our very souls.
You hear the news? Those damn mages blew up Winterhold! Guess it was just a matter of time...
'Tis a wicked axe you wield there, friend. That blade looks sharp enough to cut through a god.
Try to hide it all you want. I know you're in the Thieves Guild... and so do the other guards.
You've been seen in the company of the Companions. That's an honorable path you're on, friend.
By Ysmir, you've helped save the Gildergreen. Words can't express what that means to this city.
I heard the Gourmet is hiding out somewhere in Skyrim. You know, fella who wrote that cookbook.
Good thing you did for Nurelion, retrieving that phial for him before he died. Man was obsessed.
It was you convinced the Jarl to trap that dragon in the keep. And by Ysmir, it actually worked.
Markarth's a different place, now. Do business here, and you do business with the Thieves Guild.
Ah, Vlindrel Hall's a fine home, if you can afford it. The steward in the keep can tell you more.
So the Emperor had a decoy. Poor bastard got murdered, too. But then, I guess that was his job...
We got a nickname for anyone who trifles with us guards here in Windhelm - [QUOTE]Suicide.[QUOTE]
Word is spreading like magefire! The great evil has been vanquished! You have truly saved us all!
Hmph. You wear that armor well. Iron may be simple, but it'll stop enough to keep you in the fight.
Shirking the law in Windhelm ain't what it used to be. Not with the Thieves Guild running things...
This truce with the Stormcloaks won't last a fortnight. Bloody savages will kill us while we sleep.
Break the law here in Markarth, and maybe we can work something out. Courtesy of the Thieves Guild.
Wait, I know you. You went into the Emperor's Tower, just before... before his decoy was murdered...
Kodlak White-Mane has been laid to rest, I know. May his soul live forever in the halls of Sovngarde.
You've come to Dawnstar at a strange time, friend. Seems everyone in the town is having nightmares...
That old woman who runs the orphanage has been murdered. Say, didn't I see you coming out of there...?
There was some ruckus over by that weird black door. You weren't involved in that craziness, were you?
As if Skyrim didn't have enough outsiders. Now we've got mercenaries from Hammerfell struttin' about...
First Torygg and now Elisif. Damn those Stormcloaks. Let's hope that Erikur fares better than they did.
I mostly deal with petty thievery and drunken brawls. Been too long since we've had a good bandit raid.
You've actually done it. You've found the Sybil of Dibella. You have done Markarth a tremendous service.
That sapling you recovered means the Gildergreen will live again. Your deed honors the people of Whiterun.
Wonder what kinds of things they've got the Dibella doing, over in the temple. Mostly praying, I reckon...
I heard you were at the wedding of the Emperor's cousin. In Solitude? Gods, that must have been horrible...
The Greybeards have arranged a truce between the Stormcloaks and Imperials. How long can such a thing last?
The say the College has been snooping around Saarthal. Mages in a burial crypt. No good can come of that...
Who would dare attack the leader of the Companions? In his own hall? There'll be blood for this, I know it.
Been a murder, over in Riften. Some old lady who runs an orphanage. Those poor children must be heartbroken.
By the gods, it's true, isn't it? A dragon has attacked Whiterun. How could mere men bring down such a beast?
From what I hear, you're the one gave the Thalmor a black eye. Sure know how to pick your enemies, don't you?
Hjerim is a fine house, and it's up for sale. You should talk to the steward in the keep if you're interested.
Maybe you haven't heard, but the Thieves Guild is back. Windhelm is their city now, if you catch my meaning...
Some are saying the Psijic Monks have been seen in Skyrim. They're an ancient order. I had 'em figured for dead.
I heard about the attack on Jorrvaskr, and the killing of your honored leader. You have my sympathies, Companion.
The city's changed, friend. The Thieves Guild is on the rise... and they've got a firm foothold here in Whiterun.
What could it mean? The return of the Dragonborn? And who among us could possibly hold that honor? And such power?
My heart goes out to Clan Shatter-Shield. Kin murdered, family warhammer stolen... There's no fairness in all that.
Thanks again for helping reopen the East Empire Company. Gonna have them import me some of that aged Breton cheese.
There's been talk amongst the guards. That you are... Dragonborn. But such a thing... Surely that's not possible...
Proudspire Manor, now there's a fine home. Up for sale, too. If you're interested, talk to the steward, in the keep.
Ah, Aegisbane. Sigil of Clan Shatter-Shield. But didn't that get stolen awhile back? Hmph. Must be rememberin' wrong.
Filthy she-hound Elisif got what she deserved. Let her serve as [QUOTE]High Queen[QUOTE] of Oblivion, for all I care.
I know who you are, assassin. I guess the rumors about your kind's [QUOTE]extinction[QUOTE] have been... exaggerated.
The Greybeards have summoned the Dragonborn to High Hrothgar. Such a thing has not happened for... hundreds of years.
You know, I could have gone into that Sanctuary. Killed all those Dark Brotherhood types. But I was... sick that day.
Now, I know who you are. And... and I know your business... Just, please... These are good folk we got here. Mostly...
You! You're the one who wiped out the Dark Brotherhood! All the guards are talking about it... You're a hero to us all!
If you're looking to settle in Riften, there's a house for sale - Honeyside. See the steward in the keep if you want it.
Is it true what they say? There was a dragon held captive in Whiterun, and you... you released it? By the gods, man, why?
The Emperor's cousin Vittoria Vici is getting married soon. The reception will be public - anyone in Solitude can attend.
Is it true what they say? There was a dragon held captive in Whiterun, and you... you released it? By the gods, woman, why?
The cousin of the Emperor was murdered! In Solitude, at her own damn wedding. Not a chance we would have let that happen here.
They're saying the Dark Brotherhood has been destroyed. Wiped off the face off Tamriel. But that's not entirely true... is it?
I have to wonder... what does the Dragonborn do once he's summoned by the Greybeards? Can the Thu'um be taught, like any skill?
What business do College mages have in a place like Saarthal, anyway? It's a place for Nord dead... not your weird experiments.
I hear the East Empire Company has reopened, thanks in no small part to you. Well done. All of Skyrim benefits from their trade.
The Thieves Guild used to run this city. Now they're nothing but braggarts and bullies, rotting to death down in their Ratway...
Thinking of settling in? There's a house for sale - Breezehome. You should talk to the steward up in the keep if you're interested.
Seems the Emperor's coming to Skyrim... and one of his own protectors was going to have him assassinated. Can't trust anyone these days.
Look, that Vici woman had a bodyguard. I know it's terrible she got murdered at her own wedding, but the city guard is hardly to blame...
Seeing as how Riften is home to the Thieves Guild, maybe we can work something out if you have trouble with the law. For the right price.
We just received word that somebody tried to kill the Emperor! Turned out to just be his double, but can you imagine if he had succeeded?
There are some that say the Dark Brotherhood is back, and stronger than ever. That they've made Dawnstar their home. Tell me - am I wrong?
The guards have been saying things about you... That you're the one that... Well... They say the Dark Brotherhood... Well. Never mind. Sir.
Word is Elenwen's furious. Big party at the Thalmor Embassy, and one of the guests went someplace they shouldn't. Caused quite a commotion.
You hear the news? The Emperor has been murdered! Right here, in Skyrim. By the gods, if the Dark Brotherhood can do that, nobody's safe...
You're the one all the guards are talking about. You went into that Sanctuary... wiped out the Dark Brotherhood! Friend, I owe you a drink.
One of the guards said he saw a mage appear out of thin air. Claimed it was one of those Psijic Monks. Man's been hitting the skooma, I say.
The guards have been saying things about you... That you're the one that... Well... They say the Dark Brotherhood... Well. Never mind. Ma'am.
With respect, Companion, I'd ask that you and your friends muzzle that dog of yours. The howling coming from Jorrvaskr has gotten out of hand.
Looks like it's really happening. A peace council, attended by both Ulfric and Tullius, up on High Hrothgar. Maybe there's hope for Skyrim yet.
Been lots of people coming and going through that creepy black door. And noises...  I'd say it sounds like construction, but that's crazy. Right?
There was a fight down in the Ratway, but reports are... sketchy. Some say it was Thalmor Agents, others say Thieves Guild. Some say it was both.
By the gods. The Emperor's been murdered. On his own ship... moored in the inlet. It was... the Dark Brotherhood. There was nothing we could do...
Hey! You're the one who killed Alain Dufont, up in Raldbthar. Oh yeah, word about that got around. Man was a piece of bandit trash, is what I hear.
The Greybeards have called a peace council, at High Hrothgar. And can you believe it - both Ulfric Stormcloak and General Tullius have agreed to go.
It is whispered that one of the Daedric Princes himself is behind the murder of Elisif. It would seem even the nobility of Oblivion favors our cause.
It's no secret the Aretino boy is doing some ritual, trying to call the Dark Brotherhood. But who's going to stop him? Me? I'll have no part of that.
That hammer... Why that's Aegisbane, heirloom of Clan Shatter-Shield! Last I heard, it was stolen by a couple of swindlers. Alain and... Muiri. Yeah.
Welcome to Riften, home of the Thieves Guild. Or so they'd have you believe. It's all lies. They're just thugs... vermin, creeping around the Ratway.
You didn't hear this from me, but we've uncovered a plot to kill the Emperor! It gets better. The ringleader? One of the Emperor's own elite guard...
You know, the law here in Solitude can be a bit... [QUOTE]flexible.[QUOTE] So long as you've got the gold. That's the way the Thieves Guild likes it.
Die dog!
Die rebel!
Here they come!
Talos smite you!
Over by the tree!
A pox on the Empire!
Over by that bridge!
They're at the gate!
Archer in that tower!
We're almost through!
For the sons of Skyrim!
Send Ulfric my regards!
Take out their archers!
They're up on that wall.
Up in that tower! Quick!
This is hopeless! Retreat!
Someone take out that mage!
For the glory of the Empire!
Mage up there! In the tower!
We're through! Keep at them!
You call yourself a warrior?
Archers. Behind those windows!
Look! Up on the wall. A wizard!
Along the fence, do you see them?
By that rock over there. See 'em?
That's it! We're pushing them back!
They got archers up along the wall!
Yeaaaah! Come on, we can take them!
They're hiding over by those stables!
I'll water the ground with your blood.
They're over there, next to that house!
Wizard! Hiding over there by that fence!
Someone put an arrow in that damn wizard!
They got archers over there by the fence!
Look sharp. There they are. In the window!
Fall back, fall back! Regroup and fall back!
Keep it together! There's not many of us left!
They're in! Don't let them gain further ground!
They've got a mage hiding in that window up there!
This is it! Hold at all costs! Don't give them any more ground!
We've got them pinned in! It's only a matter of time now. Keep fighting!
Exactly.
Look, this mold is irreplaceable. I'll pay you well for its return and I can also prove to be quite a valuable ally to the Thieves Guild.
Get out.
Just leave.
Get out of my sight.
You should leave. Now.
Get away from me. Liar!
How could you? Just go.
Get out. Leave me alone!
I don't want to see you ever again.
This is a fine wedding. And to think, it's for us.
Who would have thought I would be getting married?
You're abandoning me? Me? I never want to see you ever again.
Congratulations on your wedding. I'm so happy for both of you.
This ceremony is so different from an Orc marriage. Less blood.
It's a simple ceremony, but it'll do. You're here. That's enough.
I never would have dreamed I would be getting married in the Temple of Mara.
It's our wedding day. I feel like all of Skyrim is focused on just the two of us.
Weddings always make me cry. What am I supposed to do now that I'm the one getting married?
Go away.
Got you!
You're it!
You're too slow!
He what?
I think.
So much.
Glory in battle, honor in life.
I wish more of our ranks asked such questions.
I've started seeing the Companions as a kind of family.
It means when I have troubles, I always have someone on my side.
To me, it means not having to answer foolish questions a second time.
We have Shield-Siblings to keep our backs as dangerous as our fronts.
Fight well, don't be a lout, and you'll be fine. You don't need my help.
It means resting your haunches in Whiterun more than I'd care to, for one.
My advice? Don't overthink it. Fight well and the rest takes care of itself.
When we step into battle, we fight for our own name, and the name of the Companions.
But when it's time to draw blood, there's no one in Skyrim I'd rather have at my back.
It means living such that your Shield-Siblings would proudly say they fought at your side.
The oldest fighting group in Skyrim, and nothing but glory from Ysgramor's day to our own.
This group... this family... this band... this is the best thing I've ever been a part of.
I've never been a smart one. But the Companions welcome anyone with the heart of a warrior.
It means signing on for the Nord ideas of how to live your life. Honor, battle, glory, all that.
But there's always been a kind of honor to it. We don't deal in politics or underhanded sneaking.
Just because you've been accepted here so quickly, don't think I'm going to help you rise any faster.
I would trust anyone here with my life, which is more than I'd say for the milk drinkers who raised me.
I've battled next to every man and woman here, and the bonds of sweat are stronger than those of blood.
To be counted in that line is a bit of immortality. Even if I never see Sovngarde, I'll have that much.
Deal with problems head on. Leave whispers and sneaking to the gutter rats who can't fight for themselves.
There's been a group called the Companions for over 4000 years. It's been many different things in that time.
A conquering army. Ruthless mercenaries. A band of drunken louts. And the esteemed company you see before you.
I don't know how those cozy lords manage to drag themselves out of bed every day. Why bother if you're not living?
It means waking up every day knowing that you could die, and having to earn your life by clawing for every breath.
[QUOTE]Even an elf can be born with the heart of a Nord,[QUOTE] Skjor said when I joined. I think he meant it as a compliment.
We try to uphold the legacy of Ysgramor. To bear his good name such that it never be forgotten, and always be spoken with reverence.
Lead on.
Go, and avenge my Laelette for me.
I suppose you're right. I'm not a fighting man.
Margret!
Guards! Forsworn!
Death to the Nords!
Gods, not again....
I die for my people.
The old gods give me strength!
The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!
You have stepped on us long enough!
I bleed for the people of the Reach!
A bit of jewelry for your journey home?
We are the rightful rulers of Markarth!
Oh, this pendant would look lovely on my sister.
By the Divines, the Forsworn are here in the city!
Everyone stay back. The Markarth city guard have this all under control. There are no Forsworn here.
My turn!
You got me.
Argh! You found me!
Name it.
Fine. What?
Go ahead. What is it?
J'zargo is listening.
All right. What is it?
Yes, Thane. What is it?
Anything, as long as I get to fight.
Nirya...
Can I help you with anything, Nirya?
Ah, yes. Of course. No, I don't need anything.
I'm here to help you with books, Nirya. That's all.
I was wondering. Has Faralda been in recently? Borrowed any books that you can recall?
Did she, perhaps, mention any dangerous research she might be working on? Anything that could get her in trouble?
Noooo...
I've... failed...
Nocturnal, save me...
I return to the shadows...
Not bad.
I could take her.
I could take him.
Looks slow to me.
He might just make it.
She might just make it.
How's the newcomer look?
Not now.
Oh dear.
I had particularly high hopes for her. Once she'd overcome her difficulties, she could have been quite successful here.
Ro...Da!
Bah...Qo!
Klo...Ul!
Lo...Sah!
Drem...Ov!
Krah Diin!
Lun...Aus!
Mey...Gut!
Mir...Tah!
Ru...Maar!
Yah...Nir!
Ah...Viing!
Grah...Dun!
Hsss...Hsss
Nah...Kest!
Slen...Nus!
Vah...Koor!
Zah...Frul!
Zii...Gron!
Haal...Viik!
Kaal...Zoor!
Toor...Shul!
Take it.
Sure - take advantage of the guy in jail. Okay, fine. I can make the deal sweeter.
Nice try, but my mother's already got me in jail. Maybe you should try that one on Letrush.
I obviously don't have anything here, but... there's a hidden stash in the Lodge. And I did manage to hold on to the key...
Take us!
Kill him!
Destroy him!
Let's kill him!
Kill the vampire!
Laelette! She's dead!
Make Laelette go away!
Yeah. Kind of scary too.
And it's full of vampires?
Take us to Movarth's Lair!
Um...this place looks dangerous.
Ysmir's beard! She's...she's a vampire!
Of course. But why not let her go in first?
Of course. But why not let him go in first?
She wanted to play with me forever and ever.
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep for a while now.
Morthal is full of cowards! Let's go kill that monster.
Cowards! We must kill the vampires. We have to make them pay!
Laelette was told to burn mommy and me, but she didn't want to.
I'm going to Movarth's Lair to kill that monster. Are you with me?
She kissed me on the neck, and I got so cold that the fire didn't even hurt.
Laelette thought she could take me and keep me, but she can't. I'm all burned up.
Now you just stay here, with all your friends, and I'm going to go get my shovel.
You found me! Laelette was trying to find me too, but I'm glad you found me first.
Let me just take this coin purse off your hands for you. And those nice boots you've got there.
Well, seems like you have a bit of gold left in your pockets, don't you, my friend?  Mmm, yes...
Tell me!
No. There are too many people around. Come with me.
I've told you, we can't talk out in the open. Come with me.
So the Alik'r know where I am? What did they offer you? Gold? How many more of them are coming?
Typical.
We'll get by.
Vampire!
Vampire! Burn it!
Vampire! To arms!
Burn it! Burn the vampire!
Don't like those eyes you got. There's a bad hunger to them.
Your skin's as pale as the snow. You scared of sunlight, or something?
Waiting.
We going?
Still here.
I'm still here.
We are leaving?
We heading out?
Ready to get going?
Ready to get moving?
Shall we get moving?
So, what's the plan?
Still standing here.
Mara protect us both.
You have a grim look.
I'm itching for a fight.
Lead on. I'm behind you.
Khajiit guards your back.
Ours is to follow, friend.
We've stopped. What is it?
You're ready to get going?
You are ready to move, yes?
An Orc follows to the death.
Whenever you're ready to leave.
To Oblivion and back, as they say.
My blood's calm. I prefer it boiling.
You're taking us somewhere warm, I trust?
If anyone sneaks up on us, I'll smell them coming. Or I might not. We'll see.
Wake up!
That's right, it's time to wake up, you drunken blasphemer!
We weep.
We shout.
We grieve.
I'll do it.
At this loss...
Who will start?
For the fallen...
We take our leave.
And for ourselves...
Before the ancient flame...
His spirit is departed. Members of the Circle, let us withdraw to the Underforge, to grieve our last together.
Why not?
I love you.
Faleen... I...
Oh, Klimmek...
Where will we go?
Klimmek? What is it?
Fenrig! You're alive!
Fastred, we must speak.
Oh, and to be with you!
So I hear. Come here, you.
Because... I would miss you.
Bassianus, sweetie, what is it?
I'm so confused. What's happening?
I don't want you to leave Ivarstead.
Of course I am. What brings you here?
I'll make the preparations immediately!
Fastred, I have something to say to you.
To Riften, my pet. How you'll adore the city.
But I thought you only cared about your fishing!
What good are fish if you have to eat them alone?
I had heard that Gjukar's men were wiped out. I came to find you.
But that battle isn't expected until tomorrow... Ruki, what's going on?
It doesn't matter. I'm here. We're together now. And we will be forever.
We must leave. Your father will never approve of us, and I grow weary of this place.
Sssh. It's all right. You don't need to say anymore. I had no idea you were so... nuanced.
Will do.
Keep them coming and keep them strong, Valga.
Yes sir.
Tekla. The Hall is filthy. See to your cleaning.
(screams)
Do you remember me now, Hjalti?
I've been waiting for you. Hjalti.
Mara have mercy that gave me a fright.
Hjalti? Is that you? I've been waiting.
All of a sudden, the ghost disappeared. What happened to it?
Do you think the ghost is one of... Tiber Septim's dead men?
I fought by your side. To take back the Reach from the savages.
Do you think that ghost is coming back? It seems to have vanished.
I was just getting used to that ghost being here, and poof, now he's gone.
(Sobbing)
(Whimpering)
(Sigh) Let's just kill them both, eh?
<humming>
Hroggar's fate is in your hands.
I hope Alva is not what you think.
Let me know if you find out anything about the fire.
Agh. Agh!
Help me! Help!
Hey, over here!
Is it safe now?
Help me out of here!
Ah, kill it. Kill it!
Keep it away from me!
Get me down. Get me down!
Don't let it get me. Help!
You'll never get the claw!
Don't leave me, for Arkay's sake!
Get it away from me. Get it away!
Anything?
No, haven't seen anyone.
I thought we had a guard posted outside.
Keep looking. Someone's here, I can feel it.
I knew I heard something. What's this bridge doing down?
Aren't you worried someone will wander in here? The entrance isn't exactly hidden you know.
This again? I told you we have someone standing guard out there. And, don't forget the rock trap we rigged up.
We did! Keep your eyes peeled. I don't think we're alone. You check the entrance. I'm going to look over here.
So, stop your worrying and get some rest. Your shift is coming up and I don't want you dozing off again like last time.
Back off!
I think not.
No. It's mine!
Hey! What's this?
Hmm. What's this?
I don't think so!
Who left that here?
Damn. Another fight.
Hey! That's my sword.
I'm taking it anyway.
Not if I get it first.
I'll hurt you if I have to.
Your blood won't bother me!
Someone's going to get hurt.
Looks like it's my lucky day.
I saw it first! I'm taking it.
Hands off. That's my armor now!
You'll have to fight me for it.
You'll have to take it from me.
You're too slow. I saw it first.
It's a bit worn, but I'll take it.
You can take it over my dead body!
Don't touch that dagger! It's mine.
I don't think so. That axe is mine.
If nobody wants that, I'll take it.
Keep away from that bow. It's mine.
Well! Finders, keepers as they say.
Damn shame to leave that lying around.
They're fighting over that thing, I think.
You're too slow and stupid to take it from me.
If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get.
Back off.
Just... stay back.
Ugh... damn thing.
Can't trust these things.
Farewell.
Goodbye, then.
Until next time.
Do enjoy yourself.
Until later, then.
I need another drink.
Don't let me keep you.
Good speaking with you.
May wisdom light your path.
It was a pleasure, thank you.
Come and visit me in Solitude sometime.
Keep an eye on these Thalmor. You never know...
Finality.
Such an abrupt end to our game.
Go on in.
You again. What are you doing here?
Excuse me. What's your business here?
Good day.
Hmm. As you say.
Do you have anything even remotely fresh?
Maybe you'd like to try the horker? Or some beef?
I can assure you, it's all fresh. I hunt the game myself, every day.
You don't prepare the meat with any of those strange Elven spices, do you?
Ahhhh... No, no Elven spices. Just some salt, to preserve it. You're not afraid of salt, are you?
Suit yourself, then. The woods are that way. Outside the walls, walk straight ahead. Can't miss them. Good luck on your hunt.
I'm not [QUOTE]afraid[QUOTE] of anything. I simply prefer quality merchandise. No, no this meat won't do at all. Too much fat, and it all smells... wrong.
Good dog.
Stupid dog.
Good man.
Good lass.
Goodness!
Hey! Where did I go?
I...I'm fading away!
I'm...I'm invisible!
Wow! I'm see through!
What did ya do that for?
You turned me invisible!
Hey! This could be handy!
Oh! I didn't expect that!
What have you done to me?
What the...I'm invisible!
Not bad. Now turn me back.
Magic! I'm not sure I approve.
What? Do I have mead on my chin?
You're a tricky one. Now fix it.
Ooohh... The things I could do now...
Ahhh... no one will know I'm here now.
Hey! Where did I go? I can't see myself!
Hmm. I could be a great hunter like this.
Ah! I am now like the Shadowscales of old.
Hey! What did you do to me? My body is gone!
Hey! I can't see myself! What did you do to me?
Stop that! How can I do my job if I'm invisible?
Clever. To think, now I could... Well, never mind.
Wizard tricks! An Orc faces the enemy. He doesn't hide from him.
Bah! Save your magic. A warrior should face her foe, not hide from him.
What did you do to me? What am I made of? Air? Shadow? Oh, this is not good...
Now what am I supposed to do? I can't be seen in public like this. If I can even be seen at all...
What did you do! I'm...I'm see through! This better not be permanent. You can't just go around making women invisible like this!
Have we?
Oh. Of course.
You were at Helgen!
Ho, Gorm.
Buy you a drink?
Not right now. Anything new?
Let's talk about it some other time.
The longer we wait, the worse it gets.
When the time is right, friend. When we're sure.
Still the same. I tell you, something's got to be done.
How much?
How much do they pay you per day?
Eight septims per day, plus lodging.
That's really none of your business...
If it's all the same to you, Scouts-Many-Marshes prefers to eat and drink in peace.
Eight septims for breaking your back, and then you live in squalor. How much is your dignity worth?
Sorry, my scaly friend, you've come to the wrong place. Around here we don't ignore what's happening in the world.
I... see.
Did you need something, Colette?
Don't fret, my fanged acquaintance. I shan't trouble you a bit.
Ah, my dearest Urag! How are you today, my green-skinned friend?
I only wish to escape the constant glaring of my [QUOTE]colleagues[QUOTE] and discover an opportunity for repose. Your Arcanaeum is so lovely and quiet...
It's not!
It shouldn't be. You'll be back to normal in no time.
And when you are, we can try this again and I'll be sure to get it right.
Kill him.
What? You!
You bend to me?
No.... Not again!
I'll never submit!
I won't bend. Never!
No more.... No more!
Do your worst, monster!
I... won't... surrender!
You're mine now, Logrolf.
Call... that... a... swing?
Get out of my head, Daedra!
You pledge your soul to me?
You first. Come on. Let's go.
Come out! We know you're here!
Yes. Further. Into the bowels.
You.... You'll pay for this....
So close. Your prize is waiting.
The Daedra has us. It's you or me!
Don't kill me.... I don't want to die!
I don't want to die. I can't die here!
Weak. He's weak. You're strong. Crush him.
You forsake the weak and pitiful Boethiah?
So you don't know anything about this house?
It's abandoned and it's always been abandoned.
You will kill. You will kill, or you will die!
No. Kill him. Crush his bones. Tear at his flesh.
There's another door. See if you can get it open.
Ah. But I have my own champion this time, Logrolf.
Wait. Did you hear that? I think it came this way.
But the people I asked say no one enters or leaves....
No more.... No more.... I submit, Molag Bal. I submit!
Yes. Your reward is waiting for you, mortal. Further down.
Crush the spirit from Logrolf's bones. Make him bend to me.
Mortal. I give you my mace, in all its rusted spitefulness.
Stendarr's Mercy! This isn't an ordinary Daedra. We have to get help.
Anyone seen entering or leaving? Any strange lights or unusual noises?
Fresh food. No wood rot on the furniture. Someone's been here. Recently.
Ah ha ha! You mortals and your frail, limp, pathetic bodies. Try it again.
Molag Bal. You think you can best Boethiah's faithful? I have won this contest before!
That's it. Something's inside the house. Come on, we're getting to the bottom of this.
Lazy oaf.
No shipments have come in.
There are no goods to bring to the store. That's what I'm saying.
What do I pay you for, to stand around all day? You're supposed to be bringing goods to the store.
Listener!
Look out!
Watch out!
Need a ride?
Ready to go?
That's fine.
Gee up, there!
Gee up, there.
Steady, old girl.
Sun feels good, hmm?
You ready to go yet?
Come on now, old girl.
You'd best hurry it up.
Where do you want to go?
Why is it always raining?
I can't wait here forever.
Sit back and enjoy the ride.
Climb in back and we'll be off.
Couldn't ask for better weather.
I don't know if we can outrun 'em.
Look out, I think we have company.
Hold on. This can get a bit tricky.
Just sit back. This won't take long.
Here we are. Whiterun. Everybody out.
I don't do charity. No gold, no ride.
This'll clear up soon, I'm sure of it.
What do you suppose this is all about?
Nice weather for a ride. Hope it lasts.
My carriage is the safest way to travel.
It's almost getting downright hot out now.
We're almost there. Windhelm's just ahead.
Don't be long. I can't wait around forever.
Hope you're not getting too wet back there.
I can take you to any of the hold capitals.
A little snow never stopped me, don't worry.
This rain will stop eventually. Always does.
End of the road. Markarth, right on schedule.
You picked quite a day for a trip to Markarth.
You picked quite a day for a trip to Solitude.
Better bundle up. This may keep up for a while.
Just a few more minutes and we'll be in Riften.
We made it. Windhelm. Hope you enjoyed the ride.
Here we are. Solitude. Safe and sound, as always.
I swear it rains like this every time I go to Riften.
This is it. Riften, jewel of Skyrim. End of the road.
That's Solitude just ahead. Only a few more minutes now.
You ever hear the one about the Breton and the bear-tamer?
Better get used to it. Snows most all the time in Windhelm.
Lots of lawless folk around here. Foreigners, mostly. No offense.
I bet you'll be glad to get to Whiterun and get out of this weather.
Going straight through or did you want to stop somewhere along the way?
Orc town nearby. Between you and me, we should have had them out years ago.
That's Whiterun up on the hill there. We'll be at the main gate before you know it.
Ah, good. Markarth is just ahead. I'm glad to make it through the Reach one more time.
There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!
You'll want to watch yourself in Riften. A lot of ways to get yourself in trouble in that town.
Ever been to Markarth? Some say it was built by the dwarves. I don't believe a word of it though.
First time to Solitude? Beautiful old city. Capital of Skyrim, but I'm sure you already knew that.
Windhelm's a bit cold for my tastes. And I ain't talking about the weather. You're not from Windhelm, are you?
I wouldn't wander here alone at night. Folk go missing around Chillwind Depths, the cave just over those falls.
Old Embershard Mine's up there. Used to produce a lot of iron, but collapsed and taken over by criminals, I hear.
You can see Azura's Shrine for miles on a clear day. You people did a good job with that, I'll say it to anybody.
You'll want to watch out for the Forsworn if you do any travelling around the Reach. Bloodthirsty bastards, them.
Between the cliff and Snapleg Cave there, I hate this stretch of road. There's an evil air up here. Getalong, horse.
I might have to stop and get myself a pint of Black-Briar mead while I'm in Riften. Almost worth the trip all by itself.
We're passing Fort Sungard. Unbelievable view from up there. No wonder the Empire built a fort on that hill way back when.
Say what you will about the dark elves, but they did a proper job with Azura's Shrine. Can see it for miles on a clear day.
I'm not asking, but if you happen to be the type, I hear that Kilkreath Ruin is a shrine to Merdia. You know. Daedra worship.
Solitude's famous for it's Bards College. Worth a visit if you've never been. Some of them can sing just as pretty as a lark.
Ever been to Windhelm? Oldest city in Skyrim, by some accounts. They say the big old palace there was built by Ysgramor himself.
You ever met one of them cats? - kah-jeet, I think they call themselves. I hear there's whole countries full of them down south.
Hold your breath if you're superstitious. We're passing Shroud Hearth Barrow. Everyone knows spirits guard the old treasure there.
There's Treva's Watch. I hear bandits moved in while the steward was off fighting the war. I wonder if he ever got that sorted out?
Got keen eyes? Might see nasty old Hajvarr up on White River Watch. Piece of work. Jarl should just run him out and have done with it.
I used to play in the Yorgrim River when I was just a boy. It's true! I was never afraid of the stories about Forsaken Cave, of course.
If you've never been to Riften, be sure to visit the Black-Briar meadery. A few mugs of that and you'll forget all about the long trip.
Solitude's a big port town, you know? Full of sailors and their tales of far away lands. Most of 'em's foreigners and liars, of course.
What's your sign? I was born under the Steed, as luck would have it. Really ought to visit my doomstone somtime. It's fairly near here.
If you don't mind a piece of advice, I'd stay out of trouble in Markarth. They'll toss you in the Cidhna Mine, and you'll never get out.
When I'm in Whiterun, I always visit the Gildergreen. Never hurts to pay your respects to Lady Kynareth, particularly in my line of work.
Did you spot the Dwarven ruins up there? Mzinfazzle, Finchafft, Mzinchaleft? Good thing the Dwarves disappeared and stopped naming things.
Never been to Whiterun before? The Jarl's palace is something to see. Dragonsreach they call it. Big old dragon skull hanging on the wall.
Thieves used to hole up in Fort Snowhawk there, but they were run out. Wizards, they say. Suits me fine, so long as they mind their own by.
Ever taken a swim in the Illinalta? Take care you don't get nipped if you do. Folk say it's teeming with slaughterfish. Who knows what else.
Thalmor got their embassy up that way. If I had my way, the lot of those yellowback elves would wake up in a box back to Summerset tomorrow.
You might run into some of them lizard-folk in Riften. Quite a few of them work the docks there, not sure why. Like swimming in the lake, maybe.
Now, I don't want to alarm you, but there are bandits in these parts. We're safe up here, of course. Just be careful if you're ever here on foot.
See those stones peeking through the surface? Used to be an old Imperial fort on the lake. Really! Stories say it up and sunk one day, but who knows?
You'll find Windhelm's full of dark elves. The kind from Morrowind, you know. Not that I have anything against them, long as they keep to themselves.
My favor?
I should slay you for such insolence!
My good pleasure is not some trophy for mortal sport!
Now move.
I said move!
Farewell, Sabjorn.
It will be my pleasure.
I... I don't know. What's wrong?
No, please! I don't understand...
Shor's Bones! What... what's in this?
By the Eight?! What... what's in this?
I beg you... please. This is not what it seems!
You... you're in charge here until I can sort this all out.
Look, I assure you, this is all just a huge misunderstanding!
Oh come now, this is mead... not some wine to be sipped and savored.
Silence, idiot! I should have known better... to trust this place after it's been riddled with filth.
You assured me this place was clean! I'll see... see to it that you remain in irons for the rest of your days!
And you... you're coming with me to Dragonsreach. We'll see how quickly your memory clears in the city's prisons.
Well, Sabjorn. Now that you've taken care of your little pest problem, how about I get a taste of some of your mead?
Help yourself, milord. It's my finest brew yet... I call it Honningbrew Reserve. I think you'll find it quite pleasing to your palate.
Now what?
Well then, I think  a pinch of frost salts should do the trick, right?
Oh, I get it. This is a test, right? You want to see how well I know the Potage le Magnifique.
Now, I...
Your time runs short.
Welcome to the Midden.
We will see about this...
I don't see the relevance.
There is no help for you here.
It is good to meet you in person.
Please, we do not have much time.
Well? What is the meaning of this?
Here's something to consider, Mirabelle.
You must excuse me. I shouldn't be here.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm sorry, were you about to say something?
Still you persist? Very well, you may enter.
Please do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm.
There is no solace in knowing what is to come.
Is it true? One of the Psijics was here in the College?
Your perseverance will only lead you to disappointment.
Something arcane. Very old, very powerful. Do you think...?
This is most inappropriate! We are involved in serious research here!
J'zargo regrets that there was no chance to speak with the Psijic Monk.
Yes, I've no doubt of its gravity. This, however, is a matter that cannot wait.
I am not [QUOTE]up to[QUOTE] anything. I apologize if I have offended in any way.
I suppose we'll continue this at some later time, when we can avoid interruptions.
I'm afraid I must intrude. It is urgent that I speak with your associate immediately.
Well, I'm quite sure I've never been interrupted like this before... the audacity!...
Arch-Mage Aren is already hard at work, and hopefully we'll have more information soon.
What? What trickery is this? You're not going anywhere until I find out what you're up to!
Ayleid, Dwemer, Daedric... Not even Falmer. None of them are a match. Quite curious indeed.
There's been a misunderstanding. Clearly I should not be here. I shall simply take my leave.
I'm sure you've already noticed the markings. They're quite unlike anything we've seen before.
This marvelous object. It practically radiates magicka, and yet it's unlike anything I've felt before.
Let's not jump to conclusions. We'll do all the research we need to figure out what we're dealing with.
Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here he is. Now what is it that you want?
No one's heard from the Psijic Order in so many years. Hard to believe one would just suddenly show up here.
Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here she is. Now what is it that you want?
Now, I'm not sure that you're quite as attuned as I am, given my extensive years of experience, but can you feel that?
He proposed that the real reason Saarthal was fought over by the Elves and the Nords was because something was unearthed there.
[QUOTE]Night of Tears[QUOTE], by Dranor Seleth. Old book, one I'd forgotten about. This thing here... it might be what the book was about.
Pit bait.
Milk drinker.
Pfft. Snowback.
Soft. Just like all outlanders.
Probably.
Then you're on.
Fancy a game of Iron Hearts later?
You going to lose horribly, and then say you let me win?
Quite so.
But first you'll need to learn who he is. Assuming, of course, that the Gourmet actually is a [QUOTE]he.[QUOTE] Could be a woman for all we know.
She what?
Oh, I should've known she'd try it again!
Thanks for warning me. I'll see to it this is taken care of.
The what?
The what of what? No. No idea.
Oh, no. No, that won't do at all.
I think you'd better go see Mirabelle Ervine.
That's nothing you need to concern yourself with.
Well now, there's a name I haven't heard in some time.
Please don't allow him to continue to discuss the subject.
Did you ask Mirabelle? She runs things around here, after all.
If it's important, maybe Tolfdir knows. He seems to know a lot.
No. No, I'm quite sure I have no idea what you're talking about.
Huh? That sounds ominous. Are you getting yourself into even more trouble?
Are you going to see him? Do tell him [QUOTE]hello[QUOTE] for me, won't you?
I suggest you mind your own business and return to whatever it is you do here.
The Augur? Really? Well, it's certainly not my place to say anything about it.
Perhaps I'll ask Tolfdir what really happened. I understand he was here at the time.
What? The Augur? Oh no, I'm quite sure that's... He's nothing I'm involved in. No, no.
Of course, on further reflection, that may have simply been an attempt to scare me. Hmm.
Mirabelle Ervine... Or Tolfdir. They're qualified to discuss him. Not me, definitely not.
I'm not sure what you're playing at, but you'd do well to remember your place around here.
The Augur? Tragic story, really. At least, the way I heard it. But that was a long time ago.
Not my problem. Not even a little. Take it to Tolfdir, he's supposed to be looking after you lot.
It's not enough that you've stolen the spotlight with this Eye thing, now you're looking for the Augur?
It was some experiment gone horribly wrong. Ghastly results, I was told. And his ghost still roams the halls, they say.
My goodness, it's been years since I've spoken with him. I suppose he's still down in the Midden, but I haven't checked.
I've never heard of anything like that. Did you ask Tolfdir? He's been here a long time, and seems to know almost everything.
Has Tolfdir been telling stories again? I thought I made it quite clear that this was a subject inappropriate for conversation.
Together.
And mine is yours.
Then it's settled. You and me.
As short as life can be in this land, we will have each other.
Well, look at us, getting married. Life in Skyrim ain't all bad, huh?
Good. The two of us then. All of Skyrim should get ready to stand aside.
It's settled then. Brief as life can be in Skyrim, at least we'll have each other.
Too easy.
Sky guard you.
Wind guide you.
This one's mine.
What? You have it?
Sky above, Voice within.
But we never found one. Until now.
There's the Blades agent! Kill her!
There's the Blades agent! Kill him!
No. And they're afraid of you, of your power.
Exactly. Nobody even remembers our name these days.
They're masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting.
The Greybeards are so afraid of power that they won't use it.
I'm very dangerous! Don't make me come out there and hurt you!
Very few are permitted to study with us here at High Hrothgar.
I'm not opening this door, so you might as well leave me alone.
If my friends find out you've been bothering me, you'll be very sorry!
No... No, as tempting as it is, it won't do to have both sides angry at us.
You should focus on honing your Voice, and soon your path will be made clear.
The College has had enough trouble staying out of the war. No need to make it worse.
Think about it. Have they tried to stop the civil war, or done anything about Alduin?
But in your case, Dragonborn, it is a privilege to guide you towards mastery of your Voice.
We study the Way of the Voice, according to the teachings of our founder, Jurgen Windcaller.
They live in seclusion near the top of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim.
It's a great honor for them to summon you. They speak to very few - in fact, they hardly speak at all.
True mastery of the Voice can only be achieved when your inner spirit is in harmony with your outward actions.
We used to be known across Tamriel as the protectors of the Septim Emperors. Those days are long gone, though.
Although this gift has often been misused, the only true use of the Voice is for the worship and glory of the gods.
In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain, and the practice of the Voice, we strive to achieve this balance.
For the last two hundred years, we've been searching for the next Dragonborn to guide and guard, as we are sworn to do.
The Voice was a gift of the goddess Kynareth, at the dawn of time. She gave mortals the ability to speak as dragons do.
If they had their way, you'd do nothing but sit up on their mountain with them and talk to the sky, or whatever it is they do.
The faction that rules the Aldmeri Dominion. The ones who almost destroyed the Empire during the Great War, thirty years back.
There's no worse enemy to humankind in Tamriel. The Empire barely survived the last war. The Thalmor don't intend to lose the next one.
No doubt. The appearance of a Dragonborn at this time is not an accident. Your destiny is surely bound up with the return of the dragons.
You take that book to General Tullius or Ulfric and let them have their little triumph. It will be delivered back here to me soon enough.
Trust me, there's no need to be afraid. Think of Tiber Septim. Do you think he'd have founded the Empire if he'd listened to the Greybeards?
Too slow!
I'm too swift for you!
You're not getting that treasure.
Well I...
I suppose I'm not left much choice in the matter, am I?
Very well. I trust a hefty purse of septims will suffice?
I don't think so. How do I know you won't continue to extort me? A wagon full of gold isn't good enough for you?
I don't think so. How do I know you won't continue to extort me? A wagon loaded with silver isn't good enough for you?
Well, no.
But that's not the point.
At least, when we can get shipments to her. We're late on the last one. I expect her to start breathin' fire any moment now.
Bryling owns the mine, and she's not selling. We make her some decent coin running this place. Keeps her living well in Solitude.
What now?
You again?
Oh, it's you.
Get a move on.
I'm here to help.
Blood running hot?
Are you still here?
Are you on the hunt?
Oh, got more to say?
You're a talker, eh?
To what do I owe the honor?
A stranger comes to our hall.
How goes the hunting, sister?
This had better be important.
How goes the hunting, brother?
What do you want from me, now?
What guidance could you offer me?
Look, I've got training to get to.
Thinking I need to train some more.
You're a talkative one, aren't you.
I suppose you have another question?
You might make a decent Companion yet.
Do you have guidance for me, Harbinger?
Did you just wander in out of the white?
You are new here. I don't trust the new.
You still need to prove yourself, whelp.
I can't keep helping you with everything.
Blood on the wind today. Good hunt ahead of us.
The latest recruit! Right? Wait, is that right?
Getting tired of hanging around talking all day.
Haven't seen your face before. I'm watching you.
Oh, so you're the one in charge now? Fine, fine.
Some nights I dream about the mists of Sovngarde.
Ah, fresh blood. Hope you know how to handle yourself.
You look strong. Come to Jorrvaskr and be a Companion!
I always thought the new Harbinger would be taller, myself.
You don't belong here. What do you think you have to offer?
Are you looking for help with something? This is a busy time.
Greetings outsider. If you have some business here, speak it.
This is a place for warriors, new blood. What brings you here?
Oh, hey there. I killed a bear yesterday. Did you kill anything?
What brings you to me? Find some strange creature in your travels?
Let's not waste too much time talking when there is glory to be had.
I'm still trying to figure out why Skjor let you in in the first place.
I haven't seen you before. Have I? Have we met? I'm sorry if I've forgotten.
I swear, every wanderer who shows up in Whiterun looks weaker than the last.
My brother Vilkas is a better talker than me. He should be around someplace.
Some people don't think I'm smart. Those people get my fist. But you, I like.
I hope the hunting goes well, sister. We've got the cowards on their heels now.
If you wish to hunt with me, your feet need to be quick, and your eyes quicker.
Skjor says that I have the strength of Ysgramor, and my brother has his smarts.
Good to have some fresh eyes up there at the top. I follow your lead, Harbinger.
I hope the hunting goes well, brother. We've got the cowards on their heels now.
When you get to be my age, you'll come to miss the smell of blood. Strange, I know.
Great, another ambitious visitor. You think you can just wander in here and join us?
Here to be a Companion? Well, they just let me in, so there's probably no more room.
Ysgramor himself wouldn't have the patience to deal with all the rabble around here.
I've heard you may actually be stronger than you look. Perhaps we can hunt together someday.
It's good to have another quick-eyed Shield-Sister in the hall. Come to me with any troubles.
Are you thinking you're better than me? I crawled west out of the wasteland, so show some respect.
I think by now I've killed one of every living thing in Skyrim. May be time for a trip to Morrowind.
If the Circle vouches for you, I'm sworn to respect their judgment. But that doesn't mean I like it.
We are all Ashlanders now, brother. Good to find another family that cares where they came from, eh?
I avoid going to Eastmarch if I can. Something in the air... I think it's just too close to the border.
Might head down to the meadery later. See what they're brewing up. You can smell the honey on the wind.
Come to me with questions. I know our history almost as well as Vignar by now. Except I can remember it.
Fight with us and you'll have stories to tell. Come up to Jorrvaskr if you're worth anything in a fight.
I was the newest Companion, until you came along. I guess that's ok. Just means I can show you the ropes!
Vilkas said you are the new Kodlak. I don't know what that means, but you seem honorable, so that's good.
Have you been bringing the battle to the Silver Hand, friend? I wish I could be there with you. Soon enough.
Don't let them intimidate you, sister. We both know how to keep our heads while the men let their hearts rule.
I wouldn't have expected someone like you to be the Harbinger, but Kodlak trusted your judgment. And so will I.
I've been running interference for you around here. I don't think anyone's caught on to our little campaign. Yet.
I never thought they would actually let me join the Companions. But now it looks like they're letting anyone in these days.
Yaaaargh!
Rlyehhhgh1
Ffffeeeargh!
Yes, mum?
Oh Saadia...
Saadia dear?
Certainly, mum.
Of course, mum.
Oh, yes, Miss Hulda.
Oh yes, mum. I'll make sure it gets done.
Don't forget to polish those glasses later.
Just a reminder, sweetie - the blankets still need to be washed.
You still need to remove that blood stain. From the... incident.
I'll be needing you to mop the place down extra tonight. Lots of spills!
We're running low on the Black-Briar mead. In a couple days I'll have you make a run, fetch some more.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir.
In you go.
Get him out of my sight.
This isn't over, Jorleif!
You. You're coming with me.
What is the meaning of this?
Has the whole city lost their brains?
We're wise to your scheming, you coward.
We're finally going to arrest the Butcher.
Make your excuses from the Bloodworks, wizard.
I'm sorry, sir. But you'll have to come with me.
I've been scrying and auguring to find the murderer myself.
You're under the arrest, for the Murder of Susanna of Candlehearth Hall. And Friga Shatter-Shield. And all the rest.
You liar!
How could you do that to me!
You lost?
Can I help you?
Good to see you. Come on in.
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.
Hello friend. Make yourself at home.
Let me know if you see anything you like.
Oh, do come in! I hope I have what you need.
Hello there, can I pour you a Black-Briar Mead?
It's down the stairs, dear. Just come right in.
Ah good, back for some more Black-Briar mead, eh?
I'll be over here if you need any potions or ingredients.
Welcome back to the Prawn. Let me know if you need anything.
Welcome to the Pawned Prawn. Come on in, take a look around.
Good to have a customer! You need food or drink, you say the word.
Welcome. There are many things here that cannot be found elsewhere.
If you are here to purchase, I have many spells available. Do come in.
I trust you're not planning any trouble. What can I do for you, friend?
I'm kind of busy, but if you need any potions or ingredients, let me know.
Always good to see folk come back for more. You need a drink, you just let me know.
Got something for just about everybody in here. Give a holler if you have any questions.
The Mortar and Pestle makes potions, if you can't tell from the name. Just step up to the counter.
Take a good look around. I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for. If not, let me know, I might have it stored away.
You what?
Oh no. No, no, no. This can't be happening.
Please, you can't tell anyone. It must remain a secret! I'll do whatever you want.
You will?
I mean of course you will. You can tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
...to you?
So Cicero wasn't talking to anyone else. Just... the Night Mother's body?
And the Night Mother, who, according to everything we know, will only speak to the person chosen as Listener... just spoke. Right now...
(Growling)
Are you awake?
You've returned.
Less talk, more hunt.
We should keep moving.
The blood calls, sister.
The blood calls, brother.
Speak to me, Shield-Sister.
Let's make the bastards pay.
Speak to me, Shield-Brother.
Nobody we know, by the smell.
Thank you for coming, sister.
Thank you for coming, brother.
Not now. The Underforge, tonight.
She's agreed to be your forebear.
Not here. The Underforge. Come on.
I don't think I need to tell you why.
Nothing we can do for these ones now.
So we take matters into our own hands.
They call her [QUOTE]the Skinner.[QUOTE]
They call him [QUOTE]the Skinner.[QUOTE]
There's a dead one, isn't there. Thought so.
Skjor's somewhere ahead. We need to find him.
I was starting to think you might never come back.
I would hope you recognize Aela, even in this form.
No surprise they keep vermin around. Filthy squalor.
You are due more honor than some calls and feasting.
We're getting close now. Be careful. Their leader is a tricky one.
That pitiful ceremony behind the hall does not befit warriors like us.
Don't even want to think about what those cretins did to them before they died.
I'm glad you came. It's been a long time since we had a heart like yours among our numbers.
To reach the heights of the Companions, you must join with us in the shared blood of the wolf.
Some can't separate the animal from themselves. Go feral. This poor sod could have been anyone.
Look at this. Cowards must have locked the place down after Skjor charged in. You can taste the fear.
We do this in secret because Kodlak is too busy trying to throw away this great gift we've been granted.
He thinks we've been cursed. But we've been blessed. How can something that gives this kind of prowess be a curse?
[coughing]
What the...
What's going on?!
Don't go near him!
Crystal....  gone...
G...Gavros? Is that you?
I think we're done here.
Who are you? Where's Gavros?
Almost there! We're so close!
By the gods... what was that?
Get moving, now. I'll be fine.
Find... Paratus... in Oculory...
Here it is. Magnificent, isn't it?
You've done it! That's all of them!
Something in Winterhold, it looks like.
We need to find out what Ancano's up to.
Ancano! Stop this at once! I command you!
It's very important you do this correctly.
Years of work, finally going to pay off...
Come on, get up... I need you on your feet.
That's it! You've got one of them lined up!
Let's just hope they got it right this time.
Purely to help safeguard the Empire, of course.
I'd almost given up hope. Let me get the door...
You are on the right path, and you will prevail.
The other... Well, that can only be Labyrinthian.
I hope Mirabelle is helpful in locating the Staff.
I have no idea what happened. Ancano did it, I think.
Also, I doubt you'd be able to comprehend the details.
This projection should be lit up like the night sky...
You have done well thus far, but trying times are ahead.
It is imperative that you return to your College at once.
Something is creating an incredible amount of interference.
I don't know what he's doing, but he won't get away with it.
I trust that you'll inform me as soon as the Staff is recovered.
What are you playing at? Is this some attempt to stall my work?!
Have you managed to track down the Synod, or the Staff of Magnus?
I don't know. It's like a ward, but who's casting it? Ancano? How?
So you're off to find some staff now? I don't see the point of that.
You got what you came for, didn't you? Go then, back to your college.
...but what's this? These results... They're not at all what they should be.
Please, tell me you've found the crystal. I've no wish to die in this place.
Unless you can find that crystal, there's no point in wasting more time with talk.
I don't care what it is, I want it down now! I want to know what he's doing in there!
And yet, in the end, only two locations have been revealed to us. One is your College.
From all our research, it seems they were intent on discerning the nature of the divine.
Have you ever seen the Orrery in the Imperial City? It was the inspiration for this idea.
Place the crystal in the central apparatus, and we can start the process for focusing it.
Took an incredible amount of work to get it running again. Now I'm hoping it'll all be worth it.
No matter what Gavros said, this was my idea first. The Council is going to know that when I get back.
What's important is that all of this work was designed to reveal to us sources of great magical power.
You will be called on to take swift action. Rise to the challenge, and discover what you are capable of.
I can't explain the details. That would be giving away many secrets the Synod have learned over the years.
This machinery, all of it, was designed to collect starlight, and then... I'm not sure. Split it, somehow?
It was my idea to replace one of the key elements with our focusing crystal. Months of enchantments went into it.
J'zargo has heard of the Staff of Magnus. Once you are done with it, perhaps you will allow J'zargo to... Borrow it?
I don't see the Arch-Mage. He must've been blown clear. I need you to find him immediately, all right? Make sure he's safe.
Instead of projecting the sky, we project all of Tamriel, and then harness the latent energies to overlay the positions of...
I was the one who thought of using this... this Oculory. I don't know what the dwarves called it. Something unpronounceable, I'm sure.
Aav dilon!
Dir volaan!
Kren sosaal!
Daanik Kendov!
Unslaad Krosis!
Qiilaan us dilon!
Sovngarde saraan!
Faaz! Paak! Dinok!
Bolog aaz, mal lir!
REC - no subtitles displayed; noise of evil laughter
REC - no subtitles displayed; noise of physical exertion while attacking
Ah. I see.
Well, then I'll just stay behind you a little bit, and follow along quietly.
All right.
Your call.
Okie dokie, Listener.
And yet...
Die, worm!
We will prevail!
No! The Eye is mine!
Now what's going on?!
Let's hope we succeed.
Spells have no effect!
I knew you could do it!
This is our only chance.
The College will not fall!
Still you persist? Very well.
The staff! Use it on the Eye!
You've come for me, have you?
No! You will not deny me this!
Come then. See what I can do now.
I'll not go down without a fight!
Why doesn't someone do something?
You cannot take this away from me!
You've done it! You've beaten him!
If only we'd stayed out of Saarthal.
I'm not ready to die. I'm just not...
Our order will not forget your deeds.
If only Savos were alive to see this...
You have done the world a great service.
I can't believe any of this is happening!
I'll be amazed if any of us survive this.
Psijics? Here now? What in Talos' name...
We must hurry if we're going to defeat Ancano.
We never should have brought that thing here...
To Oblivion with the rest of them - save yourself!
Head for the Great Hall, quickly! Don't stop for anything!
J'zargo is going to stay right here until this is all over.
Be on your guard. I've no idea what to expect inside the College.
I am beyond your pathetic attempts at magic. You cannot touch me.
You think I don't know what you're up to? You think I can't destroy you?
Gods, you'd better have something good up your sleeve. I've got nothing left.
He's no longer abusing the power of the Eye. I would've expected all this to stop.
So much energy... So much power. Never in my life have I seen something like this...
The power to unmake the world at my fingertips, and you think you can do anything about it?
Backbiter.
Damn boot-lover.
Now that was a punch.
You throw a mean hook.
That wasn't a fair swing.
Please, stop! I'll pay! Take it!
Ugh. You mangy piece of pit-bait.
Damn addicts always stealing from me.
Wait, I can still fight. No, no I can't.
You bested me, an Orc chief. Impressive.
Your fists speak louder than your words.
What was that? Some kind of foreign move?
Please, no more. I'll pay, I'll pay. Here!
I don't believe it. I guess you were right!
Now that's what I call a punch. You got me.
Damn it. Why'd you have to walk into Morthal?
Well fought, ya swinging bit of skeever bait.
Here... take your damn coin and get out of here!
You know how to throw a punch, I'll give you that.
It's been so long since I tasted my own blood. Sour.
Damn outsider. Why couldn't you just mind your own business?
By Sithis.
And... what did she say?
Bye, lady.
Bye, mister.
Drop by and see us again if you're ever in the area.
Don't let the men take advantage of you, always be on your guard.
Remember to tell that bastard I never want to see his ugly face again!
Quit taking advantage of us and this world might be a better place, you got that?
Bye, love.
Yes, love?
Goodbye, my love.
I'll see you there.
I'll meet you there.
Good to see you, dear.
I'll be here, my dear.
I'll see you there, then.
Then I'll see you at home!
All right. I'll see you there.
Conquer your enemies, my love.
Do you need anything, my love?
It's pleasing to see you again.
Very well. I'll meet you there.
Yes, my love? What do you need?
Ah, it's my love, come to visit.
I love you. You know that, right?
It's good to see you again, dear.
Our new home. I'll see you there!
I'll be here if you need me, love.
You're going? I'll miss you, dear.
Is there anything you need, dearest?
What do you need, love? Ask anything.
I'll be waiting for you at home, then.
Speak. You can ask anything of me, love.
Leaving? Take the world by storm, dearest.
I'll get everything ready and meet you there.
A home for the two of us. I'll meet you there.
Hello, my love. Back from some adventure I bet.
I'll see you at home, then. Don't keep me waiting!
If that's what you want. I'll see you there, soon.
The two of us, living together. I'll see you at home!
It will be our little nest. I'll be waiting for you there.
You and I, we're the only people in Skyrim worth loving. That's what I think.
Hello, dear. I haven't been drinking too much, if that's what you're thinking.
You have quite a house. I'm thinking of setting up a small store here. Sell odds and ends.
Strange house, but strong. Solid. I think I'll open a store. A task to tend to whenever you're away.
A good house. You chose well. I don't like sitting still, so I've decided to open a store. Buy and sell whatever is needed.
It's a wonderful house, my love. If you don't mind, I'm going to start a small store. Something to do whenever you're on the road.
This house of yours is wondrous, at least to these eyes. I've thought about starting a store. Something to do here when you're out.
I've seen bigger houses, but it's yours, so I like it. Now, I think I need something to do if you're ever away, so I'll be opening a store.
This house is huge. I'll be tripping my feet all over this place. Hey, I think I'll start a little business here. Something to do, you know?
Certainly.
Pour me an ale.
Coming right up.
Some wine, please?
Gimme a mug of ale.
I'll have some mead.
A pint of your finest mead.
Constance!
Yes, Grelod?
Okay, okay. I'll deal with it.
All right. I'll take care of it.
Please, just let me handle it. It's not a problem.
I'll handle it. No need to blow things out of proportion.
This place is filthy. I've a mind to cancel all town privileges unless those brats start pulling their weight.
The stores are running low. We'll need to water down the milk again. Besides, don't want the little darlings getting fat.
Hroar's crying is keeping me up at night. I'll give you one chance to talk the tears out of him, or he's getting the belt.
Seven septims are missing from my purse. I know it was Runa. You get those coins back, or by Stendarr, I'll see her rot in the dungeon.
We haven't had an adoption in months. At this rate, we'll be stuck with these brats forever. We need to get the word out. A sale, if need be.
Samuel is getting to be a problem. Fancies himself something of a [QUOTE]leader[QUOTE] to the other children. Put an end to the nonsense, or I will.
I can't abide Samuel's constant talk of his parents. [QUOTE]They're coming for me.[QUOTE] [QUOTE]This is only temporary.[QUOTE] The boy must accept his fate.
Curse you!
Guard! My fine's been paid, now set me free!
I said my fine has been paid! Now let me out!
Sorry, my ears aren't so good. You say somethin'?
You just sit tight. I'll get around to it eventually.
Right, right... Oh, look at that. I seem to have lost my keys. Might take me a while to find them.
Excellent!
I'll start translating it. Shouldn't take me more than a day or two.
Excellent.
Excuse me.
Travel safe.
Out of my way.
Imperial bastard.
Farewell, kinsman.
Good journey to you.
Yes, yes... goodbye.
I believe we're done.
Just get out of here.
What am I going to do?
Give Vex a kiss for me.
Good journey, my child!
It was nice to meet you.
Thanks for your business.
Well, that was important.
I don't know why I bother.
I'm keeping my eye on you.
Safe travels, landstrider.
Come back and see us again!
Come back and see us again.
Good journey, marsh-friend.
Keep your eyes to the road.
It's been good talking to you.
You've been kind, I thank you.
A Dreth never forgets a friend.
Remember to give at the temple.
Remember, keep this to yourself.
You didn't need to leave so soon.
Sure, leave. Not like you care anyway.
Thanks again for the ice wraith teeth.
Good, now maybe I can get back to work.
Remain vigilant and don't trust anyone.
Door's over there. Why don't you use it?
Okay, now where did I put those spiders?
Any healing potion will do. Please hurry.
I see I still have much to learn. Lead on.
Please, come back and speak to me anytime.
Return anytime. You're quite welcome here.
Watch yourself around here, it isn't safe.
May you return to Her Benevolence in safety.
I have to remember... ward first, then summon.
Visit me anytime. I'm not going anywhere soon.
Keep your belly full and your shoulders strong.
You represent Mara now. Set an example for all.
Be careful out there... Riften can be dangerous.
I'd ask you maintain civility while you're here.
Now was it two parts giant lichen or three? Hm...
Don't forget us if you need supplies for your journey.
If you need any more smithing work, come see me again.
If you'll excuse me, I have other things to attend to.
You'd do well to remember who's in charge around here.
Anything you can find would be of great help. Good luck.
Be careful, the road to Shor's Stone could be dangerous.
If there's nothing else, I really must ask you to leave.
Support Ulfric or die trying. There's nothing in between.
Don't forget to check your supply chest from time to time.
When I find that bitch, I'm going to wring her little neck.
Be cautious, the pilgrimage to the Shrine is not an easy one.
You'd do well to remember who's really in charge around here.
Just stay away from me and I'll forget we had this discussion.
Please be careful, I don't wish to be the reason for your death.
I really appreciate what you've done for me. I'll never forget it.
You're welcome in Riften as long as you continue to obey our laws.
Be careful looking for those teeth... those little bastards are dangerous.
Come back when you're ready to spend more gold... goodness knows I could use it.
Remember, nothing but genuine fire salts will do... the forge knows the difference.
My experiments can't be completed until you've brought me those ingredients. Do hurry.
Try and get those marks without violence please. I don't want to be responsible for their deaths... or yours.
Eyes open.
Something's going on here.
Out the way we came. Hurry!
We're getting out of here. Now.
See if you can get the door open.
There's no way out. There's no way out....
Finally...
Pardon me.
Keep the faith.
Anytime, friend.
Yeah. Next time.
You are excused.
Anything I can do.
Okay, I'll go now.
Stop back anytime.
Back to my errands.
Farewell, stranger.
It's been an honor.
Hey! Wanna play tag?
Blessings be with you.
Everything's in order.
I'm glad I could help.
We're done then? Good.
You are free to leave.
Fresh fish! Fresh fish!
The pleasure's all mine.
I don't like strangers...
Keep your head about you.
May song speed you along.
Plenty of chores to do...
Thanks for talking to me.
Come in and shut the door.
I was done talking anyway.
I... I don't want to talk.
It's best you leave me be.
You're trying my patience.
Feel free to make requests.
Keep your sword arm strong.
Oh, hello! Just tidying up.
You must have a death wish.
Blacksmith, at your service.
Plenty of fresh fish for ya.
Sure, whatever you say. Bye.
I don't have anything to say.
I've got some salmon to sell.
Thank you for your patronage.
Always glad to talk to a bard.
Always time for a fellow bard.
Leave me be. I'm no harm here.
Spare some gold for a veteran?
Spiced Wine to warm the blood!
We should talk again sometime.
Glad that distraction's over...
I am done with you. You may go.
Thane Bryling, at your service.
What hole did you crawl out of?
I bet my papa could beat you up.
You got business at the stables?
Glad you decided to check us out.
I should make sure Svari is okay.
I'm not looking for conversation.
Oh my, old Ma'zaka has a visitor!
Oh, hello. Have a seat, will you?
Anything I can do for you, I will.
Come back if you want to play tag.
For a stranger, you're not so bad.
Good to talk to a fellow traveler.
Tell these Horkers to set me free.
May the Divines guide and keep you.
Perhaps I'll be seeing more of you.
Do you have business with the court?
Good, we've wasted enough time here.
I'm in mourning. Can't you see that?
The finest fish, here! Caught daily!
Always good talking to you... friend.
Always good to talk to a fellow bard.
Always have your shield at the ready.
Come back to Bits and Pieces anytime.
Fresh Fish! Straight from the Fjords!
May Arkay bless you with a long life.
May the words of poets keep you warm.
Need anything, you just say the word.
Out of my way, or I'll cut you. Deep.
What brings you all the way out here?
Get your fresh fruit and produce here!
Hello, my child. Arkay watch over you.
I have no business with you. Leave me.
I'll get back to court business, then.
Keep safe. And always wear your armor.
Mama said I could help with the goats!
We'll speak again later. If we must...
Apprentice blacksmith, at your service.
Don't think I don't know what's coming.
Pa always says good men need few words.
Remind us of our place, when we forget.
Seems there's always more to be done...
Watch your feet. We just cleaned there!
Welcome to the Winking Skeever, friend.
I'm proud to call a man like you friend.
Let us walk in the steps of the Divines.
May you sword feast on Stormcloak flesh.
You know you can afford a septim or two.
I got some fine armor, if you're lookin'.
I suppose I should return to my papers...
Mother says I shouldn't talk to people...
Spiced wine for ya? It's a family recipe.
Surely you have something better to do...
You were there for Roggvir's execution...
Be well. Pray for Solitude and my husband.
Good hunting. Go kill some bandits for me.
I'm proud to call a woman like you friend.
Keep the cold at bay with our spiced wine!
May the blessings of the Nine be with you.
Spiced wine, the taste of home and hearth!
Don't mess anything up while you're here...
May the blessings of the Eight be with you.
Stop by again, sometime. I'll sing for you.
Blessings to you. The Divines are listening.
I swear, I left another bottle right here...
Arms and armor! Forged by a master craftsman!
I won't forget what you've done for Solitude.
Make sure to recommend us to your associates.
May all your adventures be worthy of telling.
Please feel welcome in the court of Solitude.
All right. Back to slicing, dicing and baking.
It's good to be away from the forge for a bit.
Oh, what delight. Another charming customer...
You can sell off that junk at Bits and Pieces.
I could swear I've seen you somewhere before...
May you be saved by the Divines, as I once was.
Sure, you make your retreat and I'll make mine.
Thanks again for finding out about my daughter.
May the light of truth keep the darkness at bay.
Soft sheets and hard liquor. What's not to like?
Come back when you figure out how to spend money.
I will thank you not to interrupt me in my tasks.
People to see and places to go, huh? Later, then.
Take care, and go with the blessings of the Nine.
Do you have business with the East Empire Company?
Fruit, fresh off the boat! The freshest in Skyrim!
I really need to get back to planning my wedding..
I thought adventurers were supposed to look tough?
Keep the faith. General Tullius will win this war.
So good to see you again. How can I be of service?
Take care, and go with the blessings of the Eight.
We couldn't have taken this city without you, sir.
You look troubled. Have you come seeking guidance?
Come in, come in! I was just about to take a break.
I've got weapons for givin', and armor for gettin'!
Papa doesn't like when I talk to customers, anyway.
Stay strong. The Eight willing, we'll win this war.
You have no knowledge of who you speak to. Go away.
A coin or two for a veteran? It's not much to ask...
Good evening. I'm Pantea Ateia, the Master Vocalist.
Okay. I need to get back to the palace soon, anyway.
Take care of your armor, and it'll take care of you.
The Temple of Divines is always open for worshipers.
We couldn't have taken this city without you, ma'am.
You got nothin' better to do than bother an old man?
Youngest bard at the Bards College, at your service.
Anyone with a stout heart like yours is welcome here.
Apples, tomatoes, leeks and cabbages! Fresh and ripe!
Don't forget me next time you need herbs and potions.
Got lots of things to take care of. What do you need?
Have a drink, rest your feet and stay a little while.
Stay guarded. You never know what could be out there.
These are troubled times. Be on your guard out there.
Unless we have specific business, I'm not interested.
Welcome to Solitude. Home of the arts here in Skyrim.
As high priest of the Nine Divines, I bid you welcome.
Be quick. I have little patience for mundane concerns.
I can always find time to share a word with a warrior.
Oh, if you haven't heard Dean Pantea sing, you should.
You, talk to egg-brothers. Deeja has no words for you.
As high priest of the Eight Divines, I bid you welcome.
Blessings of the Nine Divines upon you. How may I help?
Carriages to all the cities in Skyrim. Don't forget us.
If you need potions, head over to Angeline's Aromatics.
Remember the Winking Skeever next time you're footsore.
Blessed are those who worship, for they know true grace.
Blessings of the Eight Divines upon you. How may I help?
Don't mind me. I'm just running errands for the old man.
Few can resist my charms. Even fewer are worthy of them.
If you need a good rumor or two, I think I can oblige...
You'd better have a damned good reason for being here...
You've found the Bards College kitchen. Congratulations.
Good talking to you. Not many care to chat with the help.
Hiya! What's your name? Are you visiting? What do you do?
If you want to talk about my brother, I'm not interested.
Wander no more, for you are among friends here, and safe.
Don't forget my name. Someday, everyone will be saying it.
Just watch yourself. You don't want to meet me on the job.
Remember Radiant Raiment when you need a change of attire.
A sharp mind beats a sharp blade any day. Words to live by.
Go away. I have more important things on my mind right now.
If Erdi caught me chatting, I'd never hear the end of it...
If you're looking for potions, I think I can be of service.
Your rewards in life will match the strength of your faith.
A man like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.
If you have business, please see Falk Firebeard, my steward.
Leave me be, Imperial. I haven't got anything to say to you.
Please address all questions to the Steward, Falk Firebeard.
Return anytime you need arms or armor. My forge never rests.
Thank you for helping my Aunt, earlier. I'll see you around.
Thanks for taking the time. People never want to talk to me.
Addvar won't sell anything if I don't go and check up on him.
Come by the Winking Skeever any time you want to hear a tune.
I'm too old to work, but that don't make me too old to drink.
You here for my next interrogation? I got nothing but time...
You won't get anything out of me, you filthy sons o' horkers.
A woman like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.
I grew up tending some of these horses. They're almost family.
Let me just drop everything to help you. I don't mind. Really.
May the gods speed your journeys... and steady your sword arm.
Please come back if you're ever in need of fletching supplies.
Stick around! Still plenty of songs to sing and mead to drink.
We welcome you to worship the Nine Divines, freely and openly.
I want to check on Grani, one of our horses. Goodbye, stranger.
Looking for a horse? You'll want to talk to my father, Geimund.
The strong and honorable always carry the blessing of the Nine.
We welcome you to worship the Eight Divines, freely and openly.
You're a guest. And father says we have to be polite to guests.
It's only a matter of time before Ahtar's blade finds my neck...
The strong and honorable always carry the blessing of the Eight.
We have the utmost confidence in you and Ulfric's guiding hands.
Work hard for the future and leave the past be. That's my motto.
I must return to the court. They simply can't make do without me.
May knowledge of your Divinity carry us through our daily trials.
Need something for a potion? You're certainly in the right place.
Someday, a gallant hero will ride up and take me away. Someday...
Your path has brought you to the finest fletcher in all the land.
Hello and welcome, my friend. How may I help you on this fine day?
I bet my papa could have beat you up. He was stronger than anyone.
I understand what's best for Solitude... and Jarl Elisif knows it.
Keep your weapon out of your hands, and we'll get along just fine.
You look a little sturdier than most of the Popinjays around here.
Need a horse? I guess I'm the one to talk to, since my da passed...
Now you can say you've met the most talented bard in all of Skyrim.
Thank the gods for the end of yet another pointless conversation...
We've got strong swords and sturdy armor, if you're looking to buy.
You don't want to talk to me. I'm just a stand in for a dead Thane.
You've not seen the night sky until you've seen it on the open sea.
If you ever want to replace those old rags, stop by Radiant Raiment.
Someday, I'll be a gallant heroine. You make it look so.. appealing.
Uh oh. A fellow bard. I best not miss my notes or forget any lyrics.
Welcome to Bits and Pieces. I'm sure you'll find what you need here.
Whatever you're about to say, don't bother. I don't want to hear it.
Ah, welcome to Angela's Aromatics. Can I help with some herbal needs?
Always glad to talk to the bard who returned part of the Poetic Edda.
I'll always have fruit to buy. Until it goes rotten. Then... I won't.
Is this about the stables? My husband, Geimund, handles the business.
The Imperials are good for business, and business is good for Skyrim.
This godsforsaken war is dividing our people and destroying our land.
Wanderer like you needs a little fire in the veins. Some spiced wine?
You can catch me at the Blue Palace later, if you want to talk again.
You should think about staying the night. Corpulus keeps a clean inn.
You shouldn't leave Solitude without trying our fish. Best in Skyrim.
I'm a little busy at the moment. I've got all sorts of errands to run.
Keep my men in your prayers. They'll need them if they don't shape up.
Papa used to say I was greg-gare-ree-yus, just like him. I miss him...
Speak if you must, but mind your tongue. I do not suffer fools gladly.
There's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit in troubled times.
Good luck out there. It seems like a tough time to be wandering Skyrim.
I understand, you're an important person. I'll catch up with you later.
My duty is to keep the Jarl safe. Not play nursemaid to you sycophants.
Dock work is not good work. Better than Black Marsh though. Much better.
I have so very many ways to deal with people. Very few of them pleasant.
If you love history, you're in the right place. Skyrim is steeped in it.
My shipmates scoff at my love of finery, but I know envy when I hear it.
Papa says I won't see Roggvir any more, but he wouldn't tell me why not.
You should speak to my daughter, Evette. She's the brains of the family.
May Arkay bless you with a long life, a proud death, and a restful grave.
So, what are your needs? Perhaps a pinch of this, and a bit of that? Hmm?
Welcome to the Winking Skeever. Take a load off and enjoy the atmosphere.
You look like an adventurous one. I bet we're kindred spirits, you and I.
Folks at court won't admit it, but Sybille Stentor scares us all to death.
Hello. I'm Gisli. But you can just call me Erikur's sister. Everyone does.
I guess I should be getting back to work. It was more fun talking, though.
You reek. A little friendly advice - take a bath and get some new clothes.
Feel free to return to me with questions. The Blue Palace is an open forum.
If you're looking for potions you should talk to my aunt, Angeline Morrard.
You look like you could do with a ripe apple. Or a tomato, cabbage or leek?
Being old's not so bad. Daughter keeps me fed, and my working days are done.
I do hope you'll remain in Solitude. This city could do with some new blood.
I'm Dean of Lute at the Bards College, and no, I don't give private lessons.
If you're heading to the Blue Palace, you might want to rethink that outfit.
Lady Ateia says my voice is second only to hers. But she's selling me short.
My family's weathered its share of problems, but we don't dwell on the past.
Out here at work, Hjorunn treats me like an equal. Better than most in town.
We bards record history - we do not make it. You'd do well to remember that.
Welcome to the center of the world. Or at least my brother Erikur's world...
I'd say you're either brave or stupid, but I can already tell which one it is.
With a wife like Fridrika and a son like Horm, I'm the luckiest man in Skyrim.
I am the Jarl's Steward. If you have court business to tend to, you talk to me.
Not much work being a jailor. Long as you can ignore the pleading and all that.
Viarmo is too concerned with precision. What of instinct? Hmm? What of passion?
You know, I don't get the impression that I'm very well liked at the College...
Are you here to talk about my brother? Do you think his execution was justified?
Dean Inge says a bard can never have enough practice. So, would you like a tune?
I stand with the Stormcloaks. You Imperial dogs will never break my will. Never!
So exciting when new folk come into town. I bet you've had plenty of adventures.
Good business for the East Empire Company means all the more gold for the Empire.
I was a much younger man when I married Katla. Now I can hardly keep up with her.
Just arrive in the city? Is it true what they say, then? There are dragons about?
Seems there's no end to the needs of the Imperials. But what can I help you with?
You want knives? You want them in your belly? No? Then you stop talking to Deeja.
