Been up to the Blue Palace? It's a sight to see. Even if it is filled with fops...
Can you spare a septim? Lost an eye during the Great War, or I'd earn it myself...
Forget wine, women and wealth - give me a calm sea and a good book, and I'm happy.
Is this about the stables? With my husband gone, my son Horm handles the business.
Working for Erikur may be below my stature, but the compensation is... acceptable.
Bryling's obsession with honor and tradition is quaint, but politically irrelevant.
I really don't mean to be rude, but I don't think there's much I can help you with.
My husband handles the indoor work. Just as well - he'd only hurt himself out here.
It's hard work keeping Solitude fed, but I wouldn't trust any other family to do it.
Solitude is as glorious as they said it was. Nothing like Falkreath where I grew up.
Stay warm and keep sober. It's the two things I know for sure will make life better.
The Winking Skeever's got warm beds and cold mead. You look like you could use both.
You're new here, right? Welcome to the Bards College. It's like a... musical museum.
Any day is a good one, long as I don't have to go into town. But with Hjorunn gone...
Quickly, if you please. I'm quite busy running errands for my bastard of a brother...
Why, hello! Here to buy? If you have to ask the price, you may be in the wrong store.
Have you met my dear brother Erikur? The man's as trustworthy as a Khajiit goldmonger.
Hello, yes? I'm the Dean of History. And scribe work, when I can find some quiet time.
I don't have time for anyone too lazy or cowardly to make their own way in this world.
If you see my father Octieve around, stay clear. He'll only ask you for money or mead.
No doubt most folk in Skyrim consider the dragons terrifying. I find them... wondrous.
Only reason I'm so good with a lute is because I'm old. It takes a lifetime to master.
Feel free to look around. We have a fine selection of herbs here at Angela's Aromatics.
The Divines saved me from the streets, and they can save you from your trials, as well.
Meals are served to Bards at designated times. Find an inn if you want to make requests.
Mind yourself in my city, lass. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight...
Need a weapon? Hmmm... By the looks of ya, yeah... Think I've got somethin' you can use.
You stay out of trouble, now. The Castle Dour dungeon can break even the strongest will.
You wouldn't know it, but before my family got killed? I was the luckiest man in Skyrim.
Beirand said you got here just before the execution. Must have been a lovely first sight.
Concentrate. The battlefield is full of distractions. Ignore them! Focus on your targets.
Dorian is helping me perfect my fencing, but I don't think I'll ever be as good as he is.
Feel free to take a seat, or pray at the shrines. We appreciate worship in all its forms.
Traitors, civil wars, dragons. Bah. Those troubles don't cross my doorway. So sit, relax.
Living outside the walls is a risk, aye. But at least the guards don't come nosin' around.
Mind yourself in my city, friend. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight...
Most of the time, people just forget I'm even here. That's why I hear so much good gossip.
I hid here in Solitude for a long time but war, war follows a man until it's done with him.
I'll be sure to check [QUOTE]Talk to random stranger[QUOTE] off my list of today's tasks...
You want to know the one truth I've learned in all my years? Life's too hard to face sober.
Are you my gallant hero? Have you come to whisk me away, to a life of adventure and romance?
Lisette's a fine lass, but when I join the Legion, she's not the type to wait for my return.
Many condemn the Stormcloaks, but I refuse. There is honor in fighting for what you believe.
I wish only to graduate and enroll with the Legion. My drums will lead our troops to victory.
If it's arms or armor you need, see Beirand in Castle Dour. Bloody good blacksmith, that one.
Wanderer like you must have plenty of tales to tell. But I'm afraid I'm too busy to hear 'em.
An apple to keep you healthy? A tomato to keep you strong? Surely you need one or the other...
Do not dishonor or attempt to harm Elisif in any way. Adhere to that rule, and you'll be fine.
It takes a brave soul to wander onto my deck. It'll take more than that to leave in one piece.
It's an honor to have Viarmo for instruction on drum, but he's far too reserved for my tastes.
Jarls come and jarls go, but a good cook stays for a lifetime. And I'm a very, very good cook.
Oh, for the salt spray, the creek of the mast, and the clash of sabers. Those were the days...
Some day soon, you will all see battle. And what you do here, today, may well save your lives!
The Jarl is not to be disturbed with common affairs of court. You direct those concerns to me.
Father says I don't have the knack for reading, but mama says I won't need it to work the farm.
I'm so glad you got back from Olaf's Tomb okay. They gave you a tougher task then they gave me.
If you're off to fight, talk to Beirand before you go. His armor is well forged and dependable.
True, I may look the part of dashing swordsman, but I prefer the art of wit to that of warfare.
I get to help mother with the shop. I used to help papa too... 'till I tried to use the forge...
I think Bryling's the one you want to talk to. I'm mostly just here to scare away the riff raff.
Hmm? Sorry, I was lost in thought. I'm planning my wedding, you see. So many details to work out.
We had some trouble, while back. Stormcloak tried to set the mill on fire. But we sorted her out.
Any day is a good one, long as I don't have to go into town. But some days, Hjorunn's too drunk...
What a fascinating time to be alive! Mark me, these days will be remembered long after we're gone.
We only want what is best for Tamriel. Surely, the rebels will accept peace when they realize this.
Come on, now! I want those arrows dead center! The lives of your fellow soldiers are counting on it.
I must return my attention to Elisif. If were were to lose another Jarl while I was... distracted...
If you're heading up to Solitude you should stop to check out the view on your way. It's a good one.
The Empire, in its wisdom, has come to recognize Talos worship as a barbaric remnant of a bygone age.
I'm afraid I'm running errands at the moment. But please, visit me later at the Temple of the Divines.
My duty is simple - oversee the Thalmor Justiciars, and make sure they perform their duties admirably.
I hail from Cyrodiil, but after a... misunderstanding with the law, I needed a swift change of scenery.
Just yesterday, I saw a musician in the street playing a flute. It was... beautiful. I want that flute.
New in town, right? If you need a place to sleep, head over to the Winking Skeever. We keep a fine inn.
Everyone knows General Tullius wields the real power Solitude. Elisif? Ah, she's a figurehead. A puppet.
I don't abide fancy clothes, but you look like you might. I hear Radiant Raiments has a large selection.
If you're looking for any archery or fletching supplies, you should see Fihada. I'm just the apprentice.
Take care of yourself, and always remember: the world is ripe with people looking to spill your blood...
Now if you'll excuse me. The East Empire Company has several accounts, and it's up to me to balance them.
You heard of Ravenscar Hollow? Cave on the island to the west. Place is a roost for those foul Hagravens.
You know, the Winking Skeever's not just the best inn in Solitude. It's the also the only inn in Solitude.
Your typical Solitude wench is like the city itself. Stormy exterior, but ah the charms that lie within...
Sybille Stentor has a grasp of magical theory that I would never have expected from a human. Even a Breton.
Half of the businesses in town owe me money, and I own most of the rest. I practically run Solitude already.
I hear Adonato Leotelli's staying up in Windhelm. I've read a few of his works. Be good to meet him someday.
It's been my honor to perform at the Blue Palace on many occasions. His late lordship was quite the admirer.
Them Imperials left me to die in Anvil, and I had to fight my way back home. Then they followed me back here!
We provide clothing for all of Solitude's most... influential residents. But for you, I'll make an exception.
I once captained a ship called the Argent Raptor. She struck an iceberg and went down, just north of Windhelm.
From ship's captain to lowly crewman... I suppose I deserve it after wasting all my coin on gambling and women.
I'm just running some errands for the old man... Err... For myself. I'm just running some errands for myself...
I've seen some truly wondrous sights since I took to the seas. I had no idea a man could die in so many ways...
Somethin' just ain't right about that Sybille. You know, I've never seen her eat a thing? That can't be natural.
The Jarl has advised me not to talk about which court attendants I'd like to punch in the face. More's the pity.
If you must venture southwest, stay clear of Volskygge. It is a cursed place, a tomb where the dead still live...
Pinemoon Cave is down to the southwest, but it ain't fit for exploring. There are stories... Vampires, some say...
Ain't many visitors come to the dungeon. Every now and then Sybille Stentor will come by looking for... volunteers.
My father was all the family I ever had. I felt so lost when he died. But the crew of the Red Wave's my family now.
Welcome. Look around. We've got everything you could want in life. At least... that's what Beirand always tells me.
When I was a young rascal, I broke a man's arm with a single punch. Course, I had a horseshoe hidden in my glove...
Ah, yet another new face. I'm from Hammerfell, you see. I can hardly keep track of all the people I've been meeting.
Talos was a heroic man, but not a god. It pains the Altmer that we must remind our younger cousins of the difference.
Fletching suits me. It's difficult, and sometimes tedious. But a well made arrow strikes forth like the fury of a god.
Thanks to Ulfric's rebellion, countless innocent people can't feed or clothe their families. It's unacceptably tragic.
Ulfric is a fool and a coward, who naively believes he can bring about peace through warfare. It's rather sad, really.
Welcome. Look around. We've got everything you could want in life. At least... that's what my Beirand always told me...
I made a wish in the town well that a golden knight came to take me to his castle. Oh, does it spoil the wish if I tell?
It takes two things to be a good teacher. The first is patience. The second is a firm wooden stick for rapping knuckles.
My papa says I'm greg-gare-ree-yus, just like him! He says it means [QUOTE]smart,[QUOTE] but my brother says he's wrong.
Think I'll forge me a new sword, just in case things go awry here in Solitude. I'm the blacksmith's apprentice, you see.
You get around, right? If you come across any Stormcloaks... gut one for me. They did the same to my brother in Whiterun.
I've only been a part of the Red Wave's crew for a few weeks, but I've already learned to stay out of Captain Safia's way.
It is my personal mission to ensure that the Bards College preserves the great deeds of the past, in both poetry and song.
Off the coast a ways to the east, you'll find the wreck of the Brinehammer. Never know what treasures may still be aboard.
I can't understand why Jorn would want to join the Imperial Legion. Soldiers only appreciate one thing, and it isn't music.
Always good to see a fellow traveler. I hope you've found the roads relatively safe. Free from dragons, at the very least...
My brothers would have been appalled to see a man outdone by his wife, but not me. Without Katla, this farm would fall apart.
If you ask me, this damned rebellion can't end soon enough. I had to end my tour of Skyrim's courts. Too dangerous too travel.
When the Stormcloaks took Solitude, I thought for sure things would slow down. But they keep me just as busy as the Imperials.
Well, now. I'm afraid you've caught me a bit out of my element. Most of my time is spent in the Temple of the Divines, you see.
You here to apply at the Bards College? Well don't bother - you're too damned old. Start past four, and it's all wasted effort.
With the passing of my dear husband Torygg, the weighty position of Jarl has fallen to me. Please direct questions to my Steward.
The road to Whiterun's not safe these days. Lots of travelers just... disappear, south of Dragon Bridge. Can't find a trace of them.
I generally don't involve myself in politics. Good tales deal with the issues of the day, but a wise bard remains a neutral observer.
When I was a boy, there was a year we couldn't afford enough feed. So I snuck my dinner out to the stables, and gave it to the horse.
I can help with purchases, but if you came to talk, see my sister. She's the one who gets on with people. It's her one virtue, really.
Never forget, the most important job of any bard is to entertain. The day you lose your audience is the day you cut your lute strings.
To be honest, I simply can't stand some of my students. Only Aia shows true potential for greatness. The rest are just wasting my time.
Don't misunderstand me, friend. I like my quiet, and I like to read. But you trifle with my ship, my crew, or my captain? I will kill you.
Maybe you need a partner? Hmm? Just picture it. Two women, the dusty road, strapping men at every tavern, a fortune in gold to be claimed...
Hmph. You know, you've got a certain... fire in your eyes. Just like my Beirand. Please, feel free to look around. We've got a bit of everything.
Some say I got my position because my cousin is the Emperor. Nonsense. The man's given me nothing. He can't even be bothered to attend my wedding.
Hmph. You know, you've got a certain... fire in your eyes. Just like my Beirand did. Please, feel free to look around. We've got a bit of everything.
My position, [QUOTE]Dean of History,[QUOTE] actually covers a wide range of subjects. I teach poetry, writing, history, and the finer points of court life.
For honor!
By Ysgramor!
Glory awaits!
Found you!
I found you! Na na na, na na na!
Get going.
Get moving.
No turning back now.
Come on, move it. We have Nords to kill.
I can't believe we're finally getting out.
Good luck.
Be seeing you.
Make us proud.
I'm watching you.
Don't muck this up.
Always a pleasure...
Keep to the shadows.
Go and pick some fights.
Until next we meet, lad.
Some other time, perhaps.
Until next we meet, lass.
Good luck on your next job.
I'm sure we'll speak again.
Finally. Now I can get back to work.
Maybe I'll see you around the Guild.
No killin' or no pay. Remember that.
Don't hurry back, I won't be waiting.
I hope we bump into each other again.
A word of advice. Don't disappoint me.
If you get arrested, it's on your head.
Keep to the shadows and you'll do fine.
Off for some wine, eh? Drink one for me.
Where you off to? There's work to be done.
Hey, I still have plenty of work to do here.
There's plenty more work for the likes of you.
Come find me if you need more marksman training.
No one dies. Remember that. We're not assassins.
Find me if you're ever lookin' for some extra coin.
If you want to get paid, keep your weapon sheathed.
Use your skills, not your blade and you'll do fine.
These jobs aren't going to finish themselves you know.
What's the matter, afraid of getting your hands dirty?
Need any more pickpocket training, you just let me know.
Come on, take another job so we can both make some money.
Hey, where do you think you're going? We have work to do.
Come back and see me if you ever need pickpocket training.
If you ever need more practice with the bow, just grab me.
Remember, keep it clean. We don't want blood on our hands.
Get the job done and get back alive. That's all there is to it.
I don't want a trail of dead bodies leading here. Keep it clean.
Don't forget your represntin' the Guild. Don't do anythin' stupid.
You think you're finished? I've got plenty more where that came from.
Only way this guilds going to continue to grow is by takin' extra work.
Don't give up now... there's plenty of loot out there just ripe for the taking.
Walking away without taking a job is like passing a bloated coinpurse on a table.
Be careful out there... wouldn't want to lose such a promisin' cutpurse now, would we.
Can I give you a little tip? Take every job you can get or else you'll end up a beggar.
Hey, this guild needs the coin... walkin' away without takin' work is not going to make you popular around here.
Hands off.
Stay away from that.
It's locked for a reason.
Hey, ugly!
Hey, melon nose!
Hey, troll bait!
Hey, slug-breath!
Hey, cheese brain!
Hey, skeever butt!
How can I?
The world's going mad, and our Jarl does what?
No, we can only rely on ourselves. You'd do well to remember that.
She hides inside with her 'visions'. We need a leader, not some mystic!
The world's going mad, and our Jarl doesn't care. She's only in it for herself.
If she's the best Ulfric has to offer, we might've been better off with the Imperials.
And now there's talk of rebellion, and dragons? What help could Idgrod be against them?
She never speaks with us. She's allowed this wizard, Falion, to live in our midst practicing gods-know-what.
I hope so.
How are the young ones coming along?
Some are too happy to fight. Blood runs hot.
I remember when you were the same way. The more they train, the more they'll cool down.
Just have them focus on the calm in the battle. Control the rage, don't let it control you.
I'm on it.
Right away.
As you will.
Let's see it.
Point the way.
Let us see it, then.
I'm ready.
Great! Let's go!
Let's get going.
To the next fight.
I'm right with you.
I've got your back.
I'm ready. Let's go.
Of course. Let's go.
Certainly, I'm ready.
I will walk alongside you.
Good. We should keep moving.
Good. I'm ready for anything.
I am the shadow at your back.
Onward to our next adventure!
Khajiit walks in your footsteps.
J'zargo is ready for more adventure.
Good! Let's go find something to fight.
As you will, my Thane. I will protect you with my life.
Try not to walk into any spike-filled pits or filthy skeever dens.
Just look!
This should be lit up brighter than the night sky, and it's not! Clearly you've interfered somehow. Or...
Like what?
I'm not building a ship, sir. I'm trying to make things grow.
Well, some tools that aren't rusted through would be a start.
I'll provide you wood and timber to make whatever riggings you'll need.
Sir, I'm going to need some better equipment if you want me plowing the frost.
Marvelous.
What? How?
I'll be fine.
I'll... I can... just...
Master, look. It's the Phial.
It doesn't matter. Look, it's refilling with your tonic as we speak.
You see, you're not well! Have a seat and I'll fetch you some tonic.
Bah. If there was a tonic that could help me, I would have found it by now...
Master, you're far too old for this sort of journey. We don't know what's inside...
My thanks!
Mighty decent of you.
Oh, well, um... thank you.
Best luck I've had all day.
That's great. I owe you one. Thanks!
Thanks! I'm going to go put it on right now.
Well great! Let's see anyone try to hurt me now...
I'm going to go get it right now and wear it. Many thanks!
Of course.
Off we go.
Lead on, Listener.
I am yours, Listener.
I am honored to be chosen.
Oh yes, Cicero and the Listener! On the hunt!
But you already have a traveling companion. I fear I would just get in the way.
Oh, well... You seem to already have assistance. Surely you mean to remain inconspicuous...
Oh, but the Listener jests with poor Cicero. You already have company. You don't need my help at all.
Pardon me?
Precisely!
What could be worth studying about a long-lost civilization?
Shhhhhh...
So thanks.
Considering most of us are now dead, I assumed as much.
And before you ask, no - I don't think it was you. Well, maybe I did, but you saving my sorry hide just now sort of erased any doubts.
Stay away!
I don't want to do this!
I'm sorry! This isn't what I want!
I don't have any choice! I'm sorry!
Stay back or I'll be forced to attack you!
Is someone there? Stay back! I don't want to attack you.
Stop that.
Hey, be careful!
I'm on your side!
You're pushing your luck.
What's the matter with you?
I'm not going to warn you again.
Don't do that again. Last warning.
Once more and I'm going to have to kill you.
Thank you.
That's it.
Easy there. I didn't mean nothing. Take it.
The Augur?
Just what have you gotten yourself involved in?
Whatever is going on, whatever you're up to... Be very careful.
The words.
Rather convincing, don't you think?
I'm a woman of refined, yet simple tastes.
My wife trusts you, and I trust her judgment. So you can't be all bad.
I am a trained killer, and once again have been given purpose. Life is good.
I might ask the same of you. For you are more than mortal. You are moon-born. You are wolf.
Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like you. Hmph. No, definitely not like you.
What a curious question. Well, I enjoy moonlit nights, taking long walks on the beach, knitting and unicorns.
But I am not the Listener. Oh no. You are the Listener! You heard the words! And everything will soon be put right.
Look. If you're trying to get to know me - don't. I don't like you, and I never will. It's nothing personal. But...
I'm just a little girl! The Dark Brotherhood killed my mama and papa, and then they took me captive! Please, please help me!
But I was a prodigy! Casting simple spells by one, completing complex incantations by three. Resurrecting corpses by seven! Ha!
So you're a Companion, then? I can't imagine you got your gift anywhere else. I hope you have better luck with them than I did.
Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like most of my kind you'll find in Skyrim, that's for damned sure.
My past is long and storied, and not altogether proud. But the Dark Brotherhood saved me from myself. And I have never looked back.
Hmph. I like to say I was born with a wand in my hand. Well, not literally - you can see how painful that would have been for mother.
Ah, but that was a lifetime ago. Today, I am the last of my kind. My order is extinct. Now, I happily serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary.
I was recruited by the Dark Brotherhood, and have been here ever since. I met my husband Arnbjorn, rose to leadership. And now here we are.
Once, I was a Shadowscale. An assassin in service to the King of Black Marsh. Trained by the Dark Brotherhood since the day of my hatching.
I am a child of Hammerfell, born of the sands of the mighty Alik'r. In that great desert, blood is a shade of crimson I can scarce describe.
But I am not the Listener. Oh no. There is no Listener. Not yet! But some day, some day, some day I pray, that one will come to hear her say...
Me? Oh, Cicero is just the Keeper! I... keep! I look after our matron, you see. The Night Mother. I keep her clean, and protected, and happy...
When I was thirteen I accidentally burned down the family home. A bit of lightning gone awry. Ah, but soon after I mastered my gifts. Completely.
Here's all you need to know: I'm a werewolf. I like killing things. I love Astrid. I hate annoying people. And the color blue gives me a headache.
In truth, I'm no more a little girl than you are. I was once, of course. Three hundred years ago. Vampirism tends to keep one remarkably... fresh.
I had an uncle, you see. He made certain... unwanted advances. So I killed him. And liked it. Then I killed again. And liked it even more. And so on.
I went on to teach at the College - left after two years. Too simple. Too safe. None of them truly understood the glory of the Destruction school...
In fact, I once took a seaside stroll, on a moonlit night, and discovered a unicorn... which I proceeded to stab in the throat with a crochet needle.
This Sanctuary has been my entire life since I was a young woman. That's when I first discovered my, shall we call it [QUOTE]aptitude,[QUOTE] for elimination.
Oh yes, I was once brother to the Companions. Let's just say they found my methods [QUOTE]unsettling.[QUOTE] The Dark Brotherhood, obviously, feels differently.
Very good.
Very well.
Now go. And give the bride a special kiss, from me.
The target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
Remember, we want people to notice. Kill Vici while she's addressing her guests, as is the custom, and I can promise a bonus.
The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want.
We'll see.
Well done.
That's a good man.
Well said.
Well said! You may be fighting on the wrong side in this war.
Well, I...
Bolar and I will tell you.
How will I know when I'm ready?
I don't think you're quite ready yet.
Bolar said you had been looking for a new wife?
What next?
Worry about yourself.
Better down here than out there.
Help us and you may earn a pardon.
Nothing for it but to keep moving.
We need to find a way out of here.
I hope someone knows where we're going.
A dragon.... First in a thousand years....
Just keep putting one foot in front of the other.
Hey, weren't you on the carts with the Stormcloaks?
Ralof seems to like you. That's good enough for me.
What do you make of it... the dragon? What does it mean?
Imperial dogs... there's nothing that's too low for them.
Ah, well, if Hadvar vouches for you I guess it must be all right.
I wonder if there's any more Imperials hiding down here somewhere.
You were with us on the carts, weren't you? Not your lucky day, eh?
Thank Talos you came along... I thought I was going to die down here.
I saw Caius.. that dragon just grabbed him and... I don't know how I made it out of there...
Yeah? Why?
Yes, papa.
Just a little one! I was hungry!
I'll talk with Jala, dear. I'm sure she'll accept a potato as repayment.
I suppose. But Svari, we don't steal. We're better than that. Understand?
Svari, Jala said you stole an apple from her cart yesterday. Is this true?
You ready?
Ready to spill some Imperial blood for Skyrim?
The Imperials are here in force. Stick together.
Get the crown. We will keep an eye out for more of those dustmen.
That crown should be around here somewhere. Just keep an eye out for the bonewalkers...
What's the Legion doing here? Damn Imperial spies... Well, should be fun for us, at least. They don't seem to know we're here yet.
Your turn!
(Clapping.)
(Laughing.)
Please, carry on.
Move along, citizen.
The Gourmet. This is such an honor.
I think something's... wrong... I...
The misses and I love your strawberry tarts.
Hmmm, the Potage le Magnifique. Smells delicious.
Kill her. And make sure there's nothing left to bury.
Kill him. And make sure there's nothing left to bury.
By the gods! The Gourmet has killed the Emperor! Attack!
Aha! Here we are. Honored guests, I present to you - the Gourmet!
I get you, and the Dark Brotherhood gets to continue its existence.
By the gods! The Gourmet and the chef have poisoned the Emperor! Get them!
But aren't even you the least bit nervous? After everything that's happened?
This city is crawling with Imperial Legion, and you know what? I'm still nervous.
What? No! No, you don't understand! There's been some kind of mistake! I... Aggghhh!
Just go right into the tower, then straight ahead to the kitchen. Gianna's expecting you.
Oh... Oh how marvelous. Just delicious. It is everything I had hoped it would be. It.... I....
Oh... Oh how marvelous. Just delicious. It is everything I had hoped it would be. Please, everyone. Enjoy.
Ah, the Potage le Magnifique. So delicious. My friends, as Emperor, I of course reserve the right of first taste.
Here we are. Gods, I'm nervous. We'll go in in just a moment. Please, I'll serve. You just stand there and... be amazing.
I'm all for diplomacy, but the sooner the Emperor deals with this civil war mess, the sooner we can get back to Cyrodiil.
Lazy and useless, the lot of them. They can't even keep the Stormcloaks in line. No way I trust them with the Emperor's life.
All these damn Stormcloaks. They're making me nervous. Never in a million years did I imagine they'd gain control of Solitude.
But you know what? I've changed my mind. How about this? I kill you, and butcher each and every one of your miserable little friends?
Surprised? So was I, when a member of your [QUOTE]Family[QUOTE] came to me with the plan. We worked out a deal, you see. An exchange.
Yes, an unfortunate turn of events, that. But an isolated incident. And I have been assured that the fault was with the man's son alone.
Quite. Yet that recent business with the young officer. Maro, was it? How dreadful. The son of your commander, plotting your assassination.
You mean the wedding? My cousin's apparent murder? An unfortunate misunderstanding, no more. Cold mead, hot tempers... these things happen.
You, an assassin for the Dark Brotherhood, have just made an attempt on the Emperor's life. Would have succeeded, had it been the real man.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. Commander Maro is the best the Penitus Oculatus has ever produced. You should be half the man he is.
I suppose. But what about the old man? Son killed, family name ruined... and he acts as if nothing even happened. Think he's even fit for duty?
That man was, by far, the most insufferable decoy the Emperor has ever employed. I'm glad he's dead. Ah, but I'm even happier that you killed him.
You worry too much. The Emperor's never been safer. You think assassination attempts are planned overnight? We discovered the plot. End of threat.
You misunderstand. It's just... I feel for him, is all. To carry a weight like that. It's got to take its toll. That happened to me, I'd be a wreck.
Truth is, we are in no danger whatsoever. Killing an Emperor can be useful, but befriending one? Now that's beneficial - as I'm sure you'd all agree.
Your Sanctuary's being put to the sword right now. That's what I think of this [QUOTE]deal.[QUOTE] You killed my son! All of you! And now you'll pay the price.
A sad time.
Greetings, fellow hunter.
We follow you, hunt-master.
May Hircine guide our blades.
Show us the path to the prey.
The Bloodmoon lights the way.
We were told you may be coming.
Never thought I'd see you again.
Return when you have completed the Great Hunt.
Hircine chose you to lead the Great Hunt. So lead.
All aboard!
Am I? Am I?
Your trickery won't confuse me!
I think I've discovered more here than I could've hoped to.
Be careful!
What? Nooo!
Stop, thief!
Gods help us!
Don't do that.
Hey, watch it!
I can pay you.
Not my problem.
What in the...?
You dirty thief!
Is someone there?
It would seem so.
Whatever you say!
You've done well.
It can't be helped.
For that price? Sure.
No need to get rough!
Okay. Just this once.
It's all in this note.
Maybe you can help me.
Nah. I don't think so.
Don't hurt me! You win.
Just bring it back to me.
How can I argue with that?
You could have just asked.
I saw you do that, you know.
What are you doing that for?
That doesn't change anything.
You expect me to believe that?
What do you think you're doing?
Thank you. Here, this is for you.
You're not supposed to be in here.
I don't have to take that from you!
Okay, okay. You've talked me into it.
Gold solves most problems, doesn't it?
I'll teach you to talk to me that way!
A little coin always greases the wheels.
We've got an assassin! Check the shadows!
Oh no! By the gods! This can't be happening!
Hope you're willing to back those words up with your fists!
But mama...
And Meieran thinks that we should go there.
He's a half-decent farmer. Ask him to teach you to farm!
I don't want to hear another word about what you're learning from the elf! It's high time you learned to be a Nord, too!
Come again?
You should be.
Say you're sorry. Say it now.
What? You stupid or something?
Then I guess we're done talking.
You sure you want it to come to this?
Annnddd... Point of no return reached.
Then you are fool, and will die for it.
I am prepared to deal with your insolence...
I will not tolerate this offense against my kin.
Are you mad? Apologize, or I will gut you like a horker.
In your death may you find the honor you lacked in life.
If you value your well being, you will offer an apology...
You're making a fatal mistake. Apologize, and you may yet live...
No? You sure? 'Cause we're reaching the point of no return here...
Only your death or an apology will restore my family's honor. Last chance.
Fine. Then it will be an honor to kill you for your offenses against my kin.
You may care nothing of honor, but I do. I'm not leaving without an apology.
Honor may mean nothing to you, but it means much to me. Your apology, or your life.
Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. Your best and least painful course of action is to apologize and promise to leave my family in peace.
Damn right.
Just what I was thinking.
Did he now?
Does he have information about our wonderful discovery?
Don't fall.
Dragonborn?
I would be most impressed to see that.
It's been so long since we've had any contact with the Greybeards. Do you really have the Voice?
Fight well.
Yeah yeah...
Swift hunting.
See you around.
Take care, now.
I'd better get going.
It's been a pleasure.
I'll take my leave, then.
Now if you'll excuse me...
May you walk on warm sands.
Fine by me.
As you wish. This moment, we three, will be immortalized in song.
Fine, then.
For Kodlak!
Greetings, Shield-Sister.
Greetings, Shield-Brother.
For Skyrim!
For the Empire!
For the Emperor!
Talos guide you.
Gods be with you.
Good, good.
It can make life difficult when one's colleagues fail to recognize the research one engages in.
Not that I require validation, of course. There are just some - and I shan't name names - who would disagree.
He is gone.
But thanks to you, he died knowing his life's work was not in vain.
Hear, hear!
Here we go.
Jarl Ulfric.
Yes, my lord.
He is with me.
I'm listening.
Jarl Ulfric...
Let's hear it.
Peace, Galmar.
We walk, then.
Enough, Galmar.
General Tullius.
Damn right we do.
Tell him, Ulfric.
General Tullius...
Out with it, then.
Diplomatic as usual.
I'm sorry. Good luck.
Our terms are simple.
That didn't take long.
You both agree to this?
Are we ready to proceed?
Damn Imperial arrogance!
Your chief Talos-hunter?
Don't play dumb, Tullius!
That's enough out of you.
Very well. You may enter.
What say you, Dragonborn?
Yes, let's get down to it.
You heard the man, Ulfric.
You heard the man, Tullius.
Elisif! I said I'd handle it.
Yes, I'm ready to do my part.
I have something to say first.
Jarl Elisif, I'll handle this.
Yes, let's get this over with.
Fine. Let's get this over with.
Now, back to the matter at hand.
So, Dragonborn. What do you say?
Take your seat and we can begin.
You heard what she said, Ulfric.
She's supposed to be on our side?
We all wait upon you, Dragonborn.
You heard what she said, Tullius.
It seems we may have an agreement.
Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.
Unlike your Imperial friends here.
Ah. I believe I can be of help here.
I'm sure you have something in mind.
I knew he wouldn't be able to resist.
What would the Empire want in return?
You see what talking to them gets us?
Legate. We represent the Emperor here.
You know exactly... no. Not this time.
I have nothing to say to that murderer.
You're losing this war and you know it.
Now that that's settled, may we proceed?
That's quite an opening demand, Tullius.
Who would like to open the negotiations?
You're losing this war, and you know it.
Ha! Skyrim will never bow to the Thalmor!
Yes, that'd be entirely out of character.
Besides, Jarl Laila will never agree to...
Jarl Ulfric, what would you want in return?
Shor's bones, where will these demands end?
These are the terms currently on the table.
Aye! We haven't forgotten Markarth, Tullius!
But I at least will negotiate in good faith.
Come on Galmar. We have a lot of work to do.
Very well, Ulfric. Enjoy your petty victory.
For once you'll actually pay for your crimes.
Legate, with me. We have a lot of work to do.
These terms are not acceptable. You know that.
Delphine, we're not here to rehearse old grudges.
For now. The Blades' memory is long, as you know.
Skyrim will never again bow to your false Empire!
This is how the Empire repays us for our loyalty?
Thank you, Jarl Elisif. I appreciate your loyalty.
Why delay? Please, take your seat so we can begin.
We want compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.
We want compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.
I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.
We want compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.
We want compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.
We want compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.
You can trample us underfoot but we will rise again!
You were not invited here. You are not welcome here.
As always, the Empire's fine words are worth nothing!
I hope that we have all come here in the spirit of...
We want compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.
We want compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.
We want compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.
I suppose that's the fairest deal we're likely to get.
No. You insult us by bringing her to this negotiation?
We want compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.
We want compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.
We want compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.
We want compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.
And so the Empire runs roughshod over Skyrim, as usual.
You're lucky I respect the Greybeards' council, Galmar!
But I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.
We want compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.
We want compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.
We want compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.
We want compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.
A very pretty speech, but what does it have to do with...
I consider even talking to the Empire a generous gesture.
We want compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.
Were you? The hubris of the Blades truly knows no bounds.
What next, Tullius? Shall I just hand over all of Skyrim?
Why would I give you that, if I wouldn't give you Riften?
You had best take advantage of this truce while it lasts.
The Dragonborn has spoken, Tullius. Markarth will be ours.
We want compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.
I'm sure Jarl Ulfric does not expect something for nothing.
Master Arngeir, are you going to just let him continue to...
After that, Ulfric... there will be a reckoning. Count on it.
But it seems you have no intention of dealing fairly with me.
I know you, Ulfric. You have no intention of coming to terms.
Just say the word, and my men will help you spring this trap.
That's a lie! My legionnaires are disciplined, unlike your...
You slaughtered them - the women, the children! You butchers!
You've been even-handed so far. What do you say to our demand?
Elisif, are you really going to be a party to this foolishness?
I'm sure General Tullius does not expect something for nothing.
You are a traitor to the Empire, and deserve a traitor's death.
Once again, the Empire takes the blame for the crimes of others.
We want Hjaalmarch back, and Idgrod Ravencrone restored as Jarl.
Now we'll see if there's anything behind your talk of good faith.
These terms blatantly favor the rebels. Everyone here knows that.
Jarl Vignar, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?
Now that everyone is here, please take your seats so we can begin.
Having another port would ease our supply situation considerably...
If we're not going to get Riften, we need you to give us something.
Let's go, Galmar. I should have listened to you in the first place.
I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You made the best of a bad situation.
I'm willing to let the Dragonborn decide the fairness of my request.
Jarl Baalgruf, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?
Think hard about your loyalties, sister. I expected better from you.
Enough posturing, Tullius. If you came to talk, let's get on with it.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry to see you go. You fought well for us.
If we're not going to get Markarth, we need you to give us something.
Think hard about your loyalties, brother. I expected better from you.
You're here to blacken the Empire's name, and I won't be party to it.
He grows more powerful with every soldier slain in your pointless war!
We want control of Markarth. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.
But the Empire will accept them, until the dragon menace is dealt with.
You haven't been able to take it back yet. Why should we give it up now?
But the difficulty remains - how to lure a dragon to Dragonsreach at all?
If you think you can hold Riften, you're as deluded as you've always been.
Markarth remains allied to the Empire, under the authority of Jarl Igmund.
No. We'll stay. Out of respect for the Dragonborn and our Greybeard hosts.
Pay no attention to him. A ponderous windbag, like most Imperial generals.
You've dealt with us fairly so far. You've heard our demand. What say you?
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.
We consider even sitting down to talk with these rebels more than generous.
We have no need to negotiate when the rebels are so clearly losing the war.
You are weak. Sooner you realize it, the sooner we can see the back of you.
Do you hear that, Tullius? The blood of the innocent cries out for weregild.
So be it. The Empire at least puts the greater good above our own interests.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.
This is quite an achievement, Dragonborn. And Jarl Ulfric. Markarth is ours!
What makes you think I'll give that to you, if I wouldn't give you Markarth?
You know as well as I do that that we can't hand over Riften on these terms.
I'm willing to let the Dragonborn be the judge of the fairness of my request.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.
We get Riften back. Now we'll see if there's anything behind your fine words.
Is he with you, Delphine? If so, I advise you to tell him to watch his tongue.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.
This is quite an achievement, Dragonborn. And General Tullius. Riften is ours!
Wait. General, you don't intend to just hand over Markarth to that... traitor!
You know as well as I do that that we can't hand over Markarth on these terms.
I know you, Ulfric. If I hand over Markarth, you'll be ready with a new demand.
Imperial troops will withdraw from Winterhold, and Kraldar will return as Jarl.
Perhaps this would be a good time to get the Dragonborn's input on this matter.
So. Arngeir, is it? You know why we're here. Are you going to let us in or not?
Never mind. I can see that these are the best terms we'll get from this council.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Ivarstead.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Riverwood.
This council is unprecedented. We are gathered here at the Dragonborn's request.
We've taken it before. I'm only asking for what will be ours soon enough anyway.
First, let's be clear. This council wasn't my idea. I think it's a waste of time.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heljarchen.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Rorikstead.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Stonehills.
This is our homeland, Tullius. All the blood spilled in this war is on your head.
Ulfric will withdraw his forces from Falkreath, allowing Jarl Siddgeir to return.
Where do these demands stop, Ulfric? Do you expect me to surrender all of Skyrim?
You withdraw from the Pale, and allow Jarl Skald the Elder to return to Dawnstar.
Falkreath will be turned over to Ulfric, and Dengeir of Stuhn will return as Jarl.
The Empire will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Anga's Mill.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Old Hroldan.
You hope to gain in council what you've been unable to take in battle, is that it?
And I advise you both to listen to what he has to say, before you do anything rash.
So be it. The sons of Skyrim at least put the greater good above our own interests.
The only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Granite Hill.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Loreius Farm.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Sarethi Farm.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Shor's Stone.
Ulfric, you can't seriously expect us to give up Markarth at the negotiating table.
You should be glad enough of a chance to lick your wounds at this point in the war.
But she is to observe, nothing more. We are not negotiating with her, is that clear?
Falkreath will be returned to Imperial control, under the authority of Jarl Siddgeir.
She's part of the Imperial delegation. You can't dictate who I bring to this council.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Half-moon Mill.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Heartwood Mill.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Kolskeggr Mine.
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Whistling Mine.
You withdraw from Falkreath, and allow Siddgeir to resume his rightful place as Jarl.
Are you done? Did you just come here to make speeches? Or can we get down to business?
Galmar. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear?
Riften must be returned to Imperial control. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.
Stop! Are you so blind to our danger that you can't see past your petty disagreements?
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Barleydark Farm.
Vignar. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear?
You should be pleased, Elisif. You've done well for yourself as the Empire's pet Jarl.
Giving up Markarth is a heavy price for this truce, Dragonborn. I hope it was worth it.
Here you sit arguing about... nothing! While the fate of the land hangs in the balance!
Hjaalmarch will be turned over to Ulfric, with Sorli the Builder assuming the Jarlship.
If it were up to you, the Dragonborn would sit dreaming on this mountain doing nothing!
The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Frost River Farm.
Well that's an excellent question. You haven't overlooked that little detail, have you?
By Talos, that's an excellent question. I hope you haven't forgotten that little detail?
By Talos, the stones on this one! You're in no position to dictate terms to us, Tullius!
Can you not put aside your hatred for even one moment in the face of this mortal danger?
The Stormcloaks will withdraw from the Rift, allowing Imperial troops unhindered access.
Winterhold would allow us to directly threaten the rebel supply lines out of Windhelm...
Bah! This is a waste of time. I can see that we won't get better terms from this council.
I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You treated us fairly despite your known rebel sympathies.
Imperial promises are simply a way to lull you while they prepare a dagger for your back.
Please. If we have to negotiate the terms of the negotiation, we will never get anywhere.
The Stormcloaks will withdraw from the Reach, allowing Jarl Igmund to return to Markarth.
I don't know about the end of the world, but this dragon situation has gotten out of hand.
Jarl Laila Law-Giver will step down, and Maven Black-Briar will become the Jarl of Riften.
Ulfric will allow Imperial troops to enter Winterhold. Korir will replace Kraldar as Jarl.
We want Kraldar removed as Jarl of Winterhold, and an Imperial candidate put in his place.
Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it mead. These terms are still not acceptable.
Don't you understand the danger? Don't you understand what the return of the dragons means?
Hjaalmarch would allow us to directly threaten the Imperial supply lines out of Solitude...
Riften remains allied to the Stormcloak cause, under the authority of Jarl Laila Law-Giver.
Come on, Ulfric. You have to give a little ground here. The dragons are a threat to us both.
Giving up Riften is a heavy price to pay for this truce, Dragonborn. I hope it was worth it.
Alduin has returned! The World-Eater! Even now, he devours the souls of your fallen comrades!
Come on, Tullius. You have to give a little ground here. The dragons are a threat to us both.
If he's right about Alduin... we both have just as much to lose here, Tullius, remember that.
The sons of Skyrim will live up to their agreements. As long as the Imperials hold to theirs.
I expected better of you, Dragonborn. You swore an oath to serve the Emperor. Don't forget it.
The Empire will withdraw its troops from Winterhold, allowing Jarl Korir to return from exile.
The Stormcloaks will withdraw from Hjaalmarch, and Idgrod Ravencrone will resume the Jarlship.
You always were a fool, Ulfric. You're no better at diplomacy than you are on the battlefield.
You surrender Falkreath to us. Siddgeir steps down, and Dengeir of Stuhn resumes the Jarlship.
The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Rift, allowing the return of Jarl Laila Law-Giver.
The Pale will be turned over to the Empire. Brina Merilis will assume the Jarlship in Dawnstar.
We've made you a fair offer. If you're really serious about this truce, you need to reconsider.
Jarl Igmund will go into exile, with Thongvor Silver-Blood taking his place as Jarl of Markarth.
We've made you a fair offer. Are you serious about these talks, or are you just here to posture?
We want Imperial forces to withdraw from Winterhold, and allow Jarl Kraldar to return from exile.
Come on, Tullius, you can't seriously expect us to just hand over Riften at the negotiating table.
Do you really think Ulfric will just turn Riften over because some Imperial general barked an order?
Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it Colovian brandy. These terms are still not acceptable.
I know how this works, Tullius. I've learned the value of Imperial promises the hard way. Never again.
Once the Emperor is convinced of the need, then you will see the full strength of the Imperial Legion.
The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Pale, allowing Jarl Skald the Elder to return from exile.
Ulfric will withdraw his forces from Hjaalmarch, allowing Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone to return to Morthal.
You did well here today. I don't think the truce will last long, but that will not be on your account.
I fear this truce will not last. You gave the Empire too much. Ulfric will not let that stand for long.
I know what path you set her on. And now Paarthurnax's wisdom is lost to us, just when we need it most.
I know what path you set him on. And now Paarthurnax's wisdom is lost to us, just when we need it most.
You know I can't agree to these terms. The Emperor would repudiate this treaty and I would be recalled.
But I accepted the Dragonborn's invitation to this council, and I at least will negotiate in good faith.
But once Alduin is defeated - then it will be the Empire's turn. Remember - [QUOTE]Evgir Unslaad.[QUOTE]
I guess I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although I'm starting to doubt your fairness.
The Empire can live with these terms, yes. For a temporary truce, until the dragon menace is dealt with.
Ulfric, why so hostile? After all, it's not the Thalmor that's burning your farms and killing your sons.
He did what had to be done. It was long overdue. My only regret is that I wasn't able to kill him myself.
I expected better from you Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, despite your known Imperial sympathies.
It seems I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although I'm starting to doubt your fairness.
You may think this war is nearly won. You're wrong. I've been fighting you with a mere handful of troops.
She did what had to be done. It was long overdue. My only regret is that I wasn't able to kill him myself.
Damned Imperial lies! My men would never stoop to such methods, even in retaliation for your butchery at...
If this truce will help the Dragonborn here put an end to that menace, we both gain. Remember that, Ulfric.
The Empire will withdraw its troops from the Reach, allowing Ulfric's forces unhindered access to Markarth.
Imperial forces will withdraw from The Pale, and Jarl Skald the Elder will be allowed to return to Dawnstar.
We're here to arrange a temporary truce to allow the Dragonborn here to deal with the dragons. Nothing more.
You don't really expect compensation every time a farm gets burned in a war that you started, do you Ulfric?
I fear this truce will not last. General Tullius will be looking for any opportunity to regain the advantage.
Markarth is off the table. Your rabble is on the verge of defeat. We have no need of a truce at such a price.
Soon enough I'll have you back under the headsman's axe, and this time there won't be any dragon to save you.
Well done, sister. If you can hold these Imperials to their promises, we might be able to reach an agreement.
You slaughtered the very people you claim to be fighting for! True sons of Skyrim would never do such things.
Of course not! What will you offer for Riften, Tullius? Some empty promises? Maybe some more Imperial bluster?
Well done, brother. If you can hold these Imperials to their promises, we might be able to reach an agreement.
As for you, General Tullius, I see now that Galmar was right. Talking to the Empire is just as useless as ever.
The matter at hand is urgent. Alduin must be stopped. You wouldn't have called this council if you didn't agree.
I shouldn't agree to terms that so blatantly favor the Empire. I have no choice, though, under the circumstances.
Winterhold will be turned over to the Empire, although the College itself will retain its traditional neutrality.
Don't listen to him. Ulfric's been telling lies about himself for so long, he's actually starting to believe them.
General, this is outrageous! You can't be taking this demand seriously! I thought we were here to discuss a truce!
I just want to make clear that the only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace.
The Thalmor will treat with whatever government rules Skyrim. We would not think of interfering in your civil war.
Ulfric, you can't be taking this demand seriously? We can hold Riften against anything the Empire can throw at it.
If you think that winning a few battles means you're winning the war, you're even worse at strategy than diplomacy.
We have no interest in negotiating with the Empire. It's only a matter of time before they are driven out of Skyrim.
We know what path you've set him on. But he has made a different choice. Paarthurnax is still safe from your malice.
I expected better from you Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, and now it seems you help the Empire at every turn.
If you think you can hold Markarth, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor.
We know what path you've set her on. But she has made a different choice. Paarthurnax is still safe from your malice.
You're different from what I expected, Dragonborn. You treat us with respect, despite your known Imperial sympathies.
Blocking Pale Pass would cut one of the main Imperial supply routes... and would leave Whiterun dangerously exposed...
Hmm... the Empire is bringing in a lot of supplies through Dawnstar. Taking the Pale would stretch them pretty thin...
If you think this war is nearly won, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor.
You always were a fool, Ulfric. You'll never get a better chance to salvage something from the ruins of your ambition.
You lost the trust of the people of Skyrim, Elisif. You had your chance to make the right choice when the war started.
So that's why you're here, Ulfric? You dare to insult the Greybeards by using this council to advance your own position?
We want the Pale returned to Imperial control. The traitor Skald the Elder will be replaced with a more loyal candidate.
What about you, Elisif? Are these terms to your liking? Speak up. I'm sure General Tullius is waiting to do your bidding.
You surrender Hjaalmarch to us, and take Idgrod Ravencrone with you. Sorli the Builder will take over as Jarl of Morthal.
You'll never defeat the Empire, and you know it. But you're willing to sacrifice thousands for your own selfish ambition.
I've never liked having the rebels right on Solitude's doorstep. Retaking Hjaalmarch would help secure our supply lines...
You did the best you could, sister. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point.
You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation to this council, despite your known association with the rebels.
But beware - the Empire's loyalty is fickle. They will tire of this war, and then I will be the one dictating terms to you.
If you think we'll just hand over Riften, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor.
You did the best you could, brother. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point.
I've never liked having the Imperials right on Windhelm's doorstep. Retaking Winterhold would help secure our supply lines...
You did the best you could, Dragonborn. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point.
You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation on trust in your good name. But it seems you intend to favor Ulfric.
First, let me be clear. The sons of Skyrim know from bitter experience that talking to the Empire is a waste of time, or worse.
I admit, I really didn't expect these talks to succeed. Getting the Empire to agree to anything at all is quite an achievement.
Riften is off the table. The Empire barely has a toehold left in Skyrim. We don't need to pay such a high price for this truce.
Ulfric will allow Imperial forces into the Pale. Skald the Elder will go into exile, and Brina Merilis will assume the Jarlship.
General, you've proven yourself a good friend to Skyrim. I continue to trust that you will do your utmost to safeguard our interests.
I admit, I really didn't expect you'd be able to arrange a truce. Getting Ulfric to agree to anything at all is quite an achievement.
I ask that you all respect the spirit of High Hrothgar, and do your best to begin the process of achieving a lasting peace in Skyrim.
Regaining Pale Pass would help our supply situation considerably... and Whiterun is dangerously exposed with the enemy in Falkreath...
Blocking Pale Pass would cut one of the main Imperial supply routes... and Whiterun is dangerously exposed with the enemy in Falkreath.
We have as much right to be at this council as all of you. More, actually, since we were the ones that put the Dragonborn on this path.
Markarth will be handed over to Ulfric's forces. Jarl Igmund will step down, and Thongvor Silver-Blood will become the Jarl of Markarth.
The Empire will allow Ulfric's forces to enter Falkreath. Jarl Siddgeir will step down, and Dengeir of Stuhn will take his place as Jarl.
Riften will be handed over to Imperial control. Jarl Laila Law-Giver will step down, and Maven Black-Briar will become the Jarl of Riften.
We know a great deal about the situation and the threat that Alduin poses to us all. You need us here if you want this council to succeed.
I have no authority to negotiate a permanent settlement, unless Ulfric is ready to sue for peace and turn himself over to Imperial justice.
There's nothing else to talk about, unless the Empire is finally ready to renounce its unjust claim to rule over the free people of Skyrim.
That's what comes of trying to win a war with a bare handful of legions. If the Emperor would just give me the reinforcements I've requested!
The Empire will allow Ulfric's forces to enter Hjaalmarch. Idgrod Ravencrone will go into exile, with Sorli the Builder replacing her as Jarl.
I have every right to be at this negotiation. I need to ensure that nothing is agreed to here that violates the terms of the White-Gold Concordat.
Here we go!
Well come back when you earn some more so I can take it from you!
All right, remember... this is a clean fight. No weapons, no tricks. And none of those fancy magic spells, either.
Hmph. Fine.
Hold there.
Have you decided to pay the visitor's tax?
Before I let you into Riften, you need to pay the visitor's tax.
I... I see.
Well, I'm glad we've established this early, rather than me hearing about it years or decades later when the whispers behind my back are loud enough.
Is he dead?
Please remain calm!
This can't be happening!
Come on, Arniel. Let's go.
We've got to stay focused.
By Azura, what's happening?
Everyone please, stand back!
The Arch-Mage is dead! Dead!
This is not J'zargo's fault!
What's happened? He's not...
You brought this on us! You!
If this is somehow your fault...
Did you make something bad happen?
I hope this isn't something I did.
I'm not seeing things again, am I?
Shor's blood, what have they done?
Please, make sure Winterhold is safe!
That looks like it's the last of them.
What have we gotten ourselves into now?
I hope you have good news for Mirabelle.
Well? Is everything out there all right?
What's going on out there? What happened?
What's happening? What did you people do?
Well, this certainly won't help our image.
Please, whatever you did, just make it stop!
Find Savos, and get him back here if you can!
We never should have brought that thing here!
Protect yourself! We're under some kind of attack!
Do we have to? They'd never lift a finger to help us.
Arniel, stay on your guard. We can't let harm come to these people.
Whatever it is you're up to at the College, you need to fix this at once!
We'll stay here. Get back to the College and let them know what's going on.
Is it over?
Is that so?
We'll see about that.
Leave. Now!
Get out of my sight!
What did you say? Get out of my sight!
You're a monster. Leave and never come back!
Get out of here. Get out of here and never come back!
What'd you say to me? Get out! I never want to see you again.
You come all this way just to hurt me a second time? Get out of my sight!
Let me see.
What's she on about?
No, it... it can't be.
Vex! Put it away... right now.
He didn't need to pick the lock.
Fine. We do it your way. For now.
Wait just a blessed moment, Bryn.
That son-of-a-bitch! I'll kill him!
What's in that book? What did it say?
The gold, the jewels... it's all gone.
Now what's this so-called proof you speak of?
This can't be true. I've known Mercer too long...
Do what he says, Vex. This isn't helpin' right now.
No tricks, Karliah or I'll cut you down where you stand.
You better have a damn good reason to be here with that murderer.
By the Eight! It's gone, everything's gone! Get in here, all of you!
We can't afford to lose our heads... we need to calm down and focus.
I have Gallus's journal. I think you'll find its contents disturbing.
Use your key on the vault, Delvin. We'll open it up and find out the truth.
Delvin, Vex... watch the Flagon. If you see Mercer, come tell me right away.
I've used my key, but the vault's still locked up tighter than a drum. Now use yours.
Please, lower your weapons so we can speak. I have proof that you've all been misled!
That door has the best puzzle locks money can buy. There's no way it can be picked open.
How can Mercer open up a vault that needs two keys? It's impossible. Could he pick his way in?
There's only one way to find out if what the lass says is true. Delvin, I'll need you to open the Vault.
It's true, Brynjolf. Every word. Mercer's been stealing from the Guild for years, right under your noses.
It says Mercer's been stealing from our vault for years. Gallus was looking into it before he was murdered.
Look! Look!
Look at that fool.
Positively vulgar.
Oh! Look over there!
Why the impropriety!
Crazy, naked n'wah...
What a vulgar display.
That's certainly unusual.
Some folk - they got no shame.
Somebody get that fool a blanket.
Whoa... Not even I'm that drunk...
Wait until the boys hear about this.
A bit much, going around like that...
Somebody get that idiot some armor...
Not my thing, but who am I to judge...
Now that's something else, right there!
Shameful, really. I blame the parents.
Never see me strutting around like that!
Gah! Look over there. I can't believe it.
That's not something you see every day...
Well now! Aren't you putting on quite the show?
What is it doing? Walking around nearly naked...
What is that half-naked fetcher trying to prove?
Despite the shame, this one can't help but stare.
Oh, dear. Would you look at that? How embarrassing.
Ummm... they'd lock me up if I went around like that.
By Ysmir's beard! I didn't know it was gonna be a party!
Got to admire the chops it takes to walk around like that.
Gracious! This one is certainly unaccustomed to such sights...
Well now! That's a shamefully absurd way to go around in public.
Oh my. Been a lot of years since I've seen something like that...
For shame! You should be locked up for strutting around like that.
It takes a lot of confidence to walk around naked. Trust me on that.
They're half-naked. That ain't right. Somebody's gotta say somethin'...
Crazy person... Something must be wrong with its head, to strut around like that.
Move along.
Oh, you again.
You're clear to enter.
Don't cause any trouble in the city.
Not really.
Oh my word!
I can't pay, I can't!
Just pay them, Bersi!
This isn't happening!
Stop! That's priceless!
No! You're going to break it!
I can't believe you're doing this! Stop!
I'm telling you, this one is different...
Give it up, Brynjolf... those days are over.
Dying breed, eh? Well what do you call that then!
If I had it, I'd pay! There's no need to do that!
We've all heard that one before, Bryn! Quit kidding yourself.
Please, I don't have anything to pay you with! Don't destroy my urn!
It's time to face the truth, old friend. You, Vex, Mercer... you're all part of a dying breed. Things are changing!
Oh, Beem...
Oh, really?
So can I come?
When do I get to go hunting?
I can do that! I did it yesterday!
When you're able to draw a bow all the way to your shoulder.
Okay, okay!
He got some letter from the Legion and has left it alone since then.
All I know is that Idolaf made some effort to find out what happened to him, but was told to stop asking questions.
I'll prove it to you, all right? I'll get you the letter. Just... meet me at the statue of Talos, and don't tell anyone about this.
Okay, okay.
I'm going to check the entrance to the Ratway. Be right back.
I dunno, Drahff. They'd skin us alive if they knew we were doin' this.
Why are you always acting like such a big baby? I've gotten us this far.
You worry about bashing people's heads in, I'll worry about the Guild. Okay?
This far? We're livin' in a sewer. You said we'd have a house as big as the Black-Briars' by now.
One moment.
What's this about Riverwood being in danger?
So. You were at Helgen? You saw this dragon with your own eyes?
Well done. You sought me out, on your own initiative. You've done Whiterun a service, and I won't forget it.
Well. I trust you have something vitally important to tell me. Important enough to interrupt me in the middle of council?
Ooh, cocky.
But who knows? I've been proven wrong before.
I give you three days before you screw up and someone runs a knife across your throat.
Perhaps...
Are you sure about this?
Right then.
Run for it!
Sleep well?
The anticipation is killing me. Can you figure out who has the contract? Which one will you choose?
So, you in?
You think it'll work?
Look out! The wolf is loose!
We strike tonight, at dusk. Be ready.
Right. Lucky if it doesn't rip our throats out.
'Course not. Dogs I could train. But a half-starved wolf? Not a chance.
...Yeah. We can't have that rheumy-eyed fool as our watchman, even if he is Hajvarr's uncle. Time we dealt with both of them.
Then leave.
Try not to?
But I do realize it's sometimes not that easy. You may want to make a statement, or a contract may require a public killing.
Murder is, obviously, a very serious crime, and a very high bounty will be put on your head in the hold where the act was committed.
If the guard accepts, you can serve your time in a cell, or pay your bounty. We've all gone through it. We do what we must to survive.
You can run, obviously, but you'll still have a price on your head. If a guard attacks, you can attempt to yield by sheathing your weapon.
But, there is another option. Some members of the Thieves Guild in Riften can get their bounties... erased. For a price. Something to think about.
Uh, a nail?
Tacitus? What is this?
I... I'm sorry. I just, well, the forge gets so hot and I thought....
You thought what? You would skip a step? Not heat the metal all the way through? Useless! Now do it again.
Is that what you call it? In the Legion we would have called it [QUOTE]useless.[QUOTE] Look how brittle the metal is!
Very funny.
Wait, what?
I thought I was going to help you!
Watch this.
Just play along.
What is it, Malborn?
heavy sigh of disgust
What can I get for you?
Yes, Madame Ambassador.
Please, sir, leave me alone!
Razelan. What are you doing?
Razelan. What is it this time?
I hope you're enjoying yourself.
Someone bring me a drink, quick!
How dare you! You disgusting pig!
I'm so glad you could attend today.
Please, help yourself to more wine.
It's all for a good cause, old chap.
No harm is meant to you, happy fool.
There's no excuse for your behavior!
I hope you're enjoying yourself, sir.
I hope you're enjoying yourself, ma'am.
I propose a toast to Elenwen! Our mistress!
Ah, I see. Very well, my friend. I'll do it.
Now you're going to be sorry you crossed me.
Remove him. He's disturbing the other guests.
It's just that we've run out of the Alto wine.
An old woman can get away with almost anything.
Madame Ambassador, I'm so sorry to interrupt...
Mistress Elenwen, it's not true! I did nothing!
Vittoria! There's someone I'd like you to meet.
You there! Serving girl! What's your name, dear?
Oh, don't worry about me. I relish the challenge.
Well, I'm glad that little unpleasantness is over.
Oh... not at the moment. Maybe later. Don't go far.
Your insults and provocations have gone far enough!
No, no, that's not what I'm interested in right now.
Hello, my dear. I got your message. Where shall we go?
There's a likely-looking filly. Even if she is an elf.
Do I have your permission to uncork the Arenthia red...
Razelan. And you promised to behave yourself this time.
Uh, Brelas, sir. Did you need a drink? Something to eat?
Wouldn't want to offend our Thalmor overlords, would we?
You take it back then? You retract your statement? Well?
What does a fellow need to do to get a drink around here?
Fine, fine. Get your hands off me. I'll be a good boy now.
I apologize for the disruption to such a festive occasion.
The hospitality of the Thalmor Embassy is at your service.
Um, thank you. Sir. Was there anything else I can do for you?
How dare you speak of the Thalmor in such a disgusting manner!
Begone, serpent! Begone from this house and trouble it no more!
I'm sure he's learned his lesson. Let's try to enjoy ourselves.
Beware of the serpent in your midst! Beware, oh people of Skyrim!
Don't you dare walk away from me, you slut! Do you know who I am?
I demand that you have this wench removed from my presence at once!
Of course. I've told you before not to bother me with such trifles.
Oh... all right. If it's so important to you, I suppose I can help.
Hey, Razelan, remember when you told me I'd never amount to anything?
Sir, you must tell her! You don't know what they'll do to me! Please!
I just wanted to get a better look at you. I like what I see, my dear.
Very well. I suppose there's nothing wrong with a bit of harmless fun.
What...! Do you know who I am? I should have you taken up and flogged!
Don't worry, Orthus. I'm doing my best to get you reassigned to Solitude.
I'm sure he'll behave himself for the rest of the evening, won't you dear?
Well, I don't think you should stay things like that about the Ambassador!
I know you're drunk as usual, but that's no excuse for insulting our hostess.
Oh, Ambassador Elenwen, that won't be necessary. It is just Razelan, after all.
My apologies. We'll have to get better acquainted later. Please, enjoy yourself.
I trust that this is just the begining of a long and mutually beneficial relationship.
Elenwen! This servant girl has been throwing herself at me in a most disgusting manner.
Attention, everyone! Could I have your attention, please! I have an announcement to make!
This is preposterous. Disrespect... insulting! I am tired of being hounded from all sides!
I protest! This is an insult to the dignity of my person! This time I'm completely innocent!
What? I'm sorry, sir, but you must have misunderstood. I'm not permitted to leave the party.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression earlier. I meant no disrespect.
When people talk about the decadent, tottering Empire, it's people like you they have in mind!
Is that so, Erikur? And you with such delicate sensibilities. It must have been most upsetting.
No, I'm sorry, but I can't go anywhere with you. I won't. Please, I must get back to my duties.
Oh, don't worry. I'll let you make it up to me. Now, where can we go for a little privacy, hmm?
I'd kill you where you stand if I wasn't bound by my oath as an officer of the Aldmeri Dominion.
Although... most of you are already in bed with her! But again... I speak figuratively, of course!
Right here! I see it in your face! The snakes writhe behind your eyes! Get away, get away from me!
Dear me. All this trouble over me? I think I was confused. There's no harm in him. Please, let him go.
Oh... I'm afraid I may have overreacted. Please, I've already forgotten whatever it was he said to me.
Well, now. There's no need to ruin the party on my account. I don't think he'll be bothering me again.
And believe me, I don't say that to everyone. I'm very discriminating when it comes to the female form.
Ulfric Stormcloak? The rightful High King? That's bordering on treason, man! Stand up. Stand up, I say!
You behave like you're carousing in a house of ill repute, not the residence of the Thalmor Ambassador!
Hmm? Did you say snakes? Where? I hate them, always slithering they way they do... what? Are they on me?
What? Of course I know who you are... I didn't mean to suggest, that is, I don't remember even saying that...
You're a disgrace to the Empire. To think that you're actually the representative of the East Empire Company.
Absolutely not! I protest... uh, that is, yes, of course. I still don't understand what just... oh never mind.
I don't think anyone deserves that kind of abuse! I've known plenty of elves who were perfectly decent people.
Tell your men to stand down. I don't need any help dealing with this kind of fool. He isn't worth the trouble.
That is absolutely untrue! Uh, that is, yes, of course. What... I don't understand why everyone... never mind.
The head office will hear of this, Razelan! You're a disgrace to the East Empire Company, and to the Empire itself!
I'm sorry, Ambassador. I didn't mean to cause such a commotion. There's no need to have him thrown out on my account.
Madame Ambassador, you know that I would never have behaved... that is to say... well I swear I'm innocent this time!
So. You think you can toy with me, is that it? No, my dear. I have my heart set on you, and I always get what I want.
I speak figuratively, of course. Nothing could be more unlikely than that someone would actually want her in their bed.
What? I didn't... hmm? No, listen, you must have misunderstood... I would never openly insult your... that is to say...
Well. Whatever the truth of it, I'm sure a few words with Master Rulindil will have a salutary effect. Take her downstairs.
Oh, I don't think so. I think I understand perfectly. Don't worry, my dear, I will make any necessary excuses to your employer.
What? I didn't... hmm? No, listen, you must have misunderstood... I don't mean to say I wouldn't be interested... what I mean is...
It's very nice to meet you. You'll have to excuse Orthus here. He so rarely gets back to civilization. Stuck in Windhelm, poor fellow.
Forgive me, Ambassador. I allowed this... fool to provoke me. The fault is mine. There is no need for further disruption on my account.
You've got a lot of nerve, suggesting something like that, to me of all people! If this was Riften, I'd have you thrown in the dungeon!
I don't understand... did you say Ulfric Stormcloak? Fine fellow, although a bit too fond of... I mean, no, of course, I condemn him in the most...
Well, well.
All right, you delivered on your end, so I'll deliver on mine. Here's the gem Arniel was after.
Can't imagine what he expects to do with that... it's warped beyond any ability to capture a soul.
What is it?
What do you need?
Why's that?
Ha! Too true, my friend. Too true...
Drink Honningbrew Mead with a wench on each arm? Ha ha!
I'd rather have two bottles of mead then two wenches, friend.
The meads won't argue your ear off about which one should go first!
Ah, is there any way you'd rather spend the day than drinking Honningbrew Mead?
Yeah. Here.
That you have. Here.
Yeah, yeah. Go on in.
Fair fight. Here you are.
Here. I hope you choke on it.
You're a real fighter. I like that.
All right. I'll lay off him. Just leave.
My axe is yours, outlander. Just say the word.
You got me, fair and square. Tell Haran I'll pay.
All right. Tell the old man his debts are settled.
You ever need my steel by your side, you just ask.
Fine! I'll take care of it, just please leave me alone!
I guess I shouldn't boast so much... it gets expensive!
You're no liar. Best fight I've had in years. There you are.
Not at all. It's good to be put in your place once in a while.
I was sent by Nepos the Nose. The old man hands out the orders.
You win. On my honor, Carlotta won't have to worry about me ever again.
I get your point. Tell Iddra I'm sorry for being so stubborn about the coin.
He told me to make sure you didn't get in the way. That's all I know, I swear!
Fine. The hilt is in a chest inside my house.  Here are the keys. Take that damn thing and go.
I yield. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, the Argonians will be paid as much as any other worker.
You ever need another blade at your side, just ask. Wouldn't mind seeing how you handle a few trolls.
Yes, let's!
Yes, ma'am.
But mom, it's so boring with just me and Torom. I was just asking Skaggi some questions.
You leave him alone. I don't want to hear Skaggi telling me you've been bothering him again!
Skaggi tells me that you were bothering him today. Can't you and Torom just play by yourselves?
Yes. It is.
Fair enough.
You got it?
I said get down there. Now.
All right, prisoner. Eyes front. You're in Cidhna Mine, now. And we expect you to earn your keep.
There's no resting your hide in a cell in this prison. Here, you work. You'll mine ore until you start throwing up silver bars.
Ahhh. Yes...
Already did.
By the nine!
Damn dustmen!
So far so good.
It's the Legion!
Uh oh! Look out!
Imperials! Kill them!
What's the situation?
Everyone else, with me.
Why don't you stay dead?
Just what I was afraid of!
What did you need, soldier?
Hadvar... get away from there!
Well, that's something at least.
The Stormcloaks will never stop us.
Draugr. Dammit. I hate those things.
And this must be the Hall of Stories.
Must be here somewhere. Keep looking.
Follow me. Let's see where this leads.
How's it going? You find anything yet?
Alright, get the crown off that draugr!
Everybody ready? We charge on my signal.
It's got to be the Imperials! Find them!
The Legion is here! Defend the entrance!
Well done. They never knew what hit them.
Good work! Lucky we had you with us today.
Take that crown back to Solitude, soldier.
Alright, let's move, men! We've got more...
Have it your way. Let's get that crown men!
Stick close. This place gives me the creeps.
But there isn't any other way through, Legate.
Be careful men. There's bound to be more up ahead.
Looks like we weren't the first ones here, either.
All for some old crown? It's a strange war all right.
Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. Let's move out!
Let's show these rebels what real soldiers look like.
We're not leaving here until we get what we came for.
Alright legionnaires! Spread out and see what we've got.
This may sound obvious, but do you see a lever anywhere?
Be careful, friend. This place doesn't seem too... forgiving.
Maybe there's something on the claw itself that could help us.
Keep looking. There's got to be some way to get that gate open.
Let's not jump to conclusions, soldier. The Legion always finds a way.
Steady, legionnaires! We've been through worse. Just keep your guard up!
Hmm... what is that? Some kind of stone claw? I wonder what it's used for.
I'd rather take a moment and look around than walk blindly into an ambush.
We'll stay here and see if we can find anything else that could be of use.
Too bad we can't read these carvings.  Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?
Steady now. The Legion has faced down worse than a few dusty old bonewalkers.
You have your orders. Rendezvous with the rest of the men outside Korvanjund.
Careful! I wouldn't do that again unless you know for sure it's going to open.
Ulfric the Pretender wants that crown, but we're not going to let him have it.
Listen up, legionnaires. Those Stormcloaks are here for the same reason we are.
The crown should be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes open.
Hey, I found a crown over here on this corpse. Is this the one we're looking for?
Don't wait for me. Get to Korvanjund as soon as you're ready. I'll meet you there.
Auxiliary, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open.
Get the crown already. We don't need to hang around here any longer than necessary.
Maybe that claw has a clue on it? You know, how to set the rings so the door will open.
Well, King... If you don't mind, we'll just take that crown of yours and be on our way.
We had the advantage of surprise this time, but don't expect it to last. Let's move out.
One thing at a time soldier. Focus on our primary mission. We're searching for the crown.
No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut it or you'll ruin our ambush.
Auxiliary, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting.
You two, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Stormcloak reinforcements taking us by surprise.
Is this what killed that Stormcloak over there? Can't be. It looks like it's been dead for a hundred years.
General Tullius is counting on us to bring back the Jagged Crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do.
Oh... I've heard of this. These walls are supposed to show the history of the ancients who built this place.
Even if these carvings tell us where the crown is, I'm sure we're going to have to find a way through this door.
Stormcloaks were already camped out around the entrance when we got here. They don't know we're here yet, though.
But don't underestimate the Stormcloaks. Many are Legion veterans. They may be traitors, but they know how to fight.
See what you can figure out auxillary, I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something.
I realize some of you may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and will not hesitate to end your lives either.
By the Nine!
What a sight....
Mighty impressive.
By the Twin Moons...
That's...that's...wow.
Wow! That's impressive.
Don't see that every day.
Damn. That's quite a sight.
By Ysmir! That's impressive.
Impressive. Damn impressive.
Wow. Would you look at that.
By the Hist, what a sight....
Gotta admit, that's impressive.
I've seen better. Well, maybe not.
I've never seen anything quite like that.
Look at that. Am I drunk? I must be drunk.
Come closer!
Yes, Grelod.
Oh my goodness!
A little closer.
Did you see that?
Yeah! Get her! Kill her!
Now, what do you all say?
Don't run. Stay for dinner!
Ah, yes. No fat on this one!
Give me just one... little... bite!
Just... leave here! Leave us alone!
Come over here. Please pretty please?
I've been waiting for you, my sweet one.
Yes, yes. Closer. I won't bite. Promise.
Whoa! They killed Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
I'm going to eat well tonight, my darling!
Oh yes. You're a fine fat one, aren't you!
No, no, no. I've got more blood than you know!
I have a present for you. A nice, shiny present.
We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness.
Ah. Ha ha! Come here, come here come here come here!
That's better. Now scurry off, my little guttersnipes.
Begone from here! Get out of this orphanage! Help!Somebody help me!
No! You can't be here! You're all dead! I already killed you over and over!
Those who shirk their duties will get an extra beating. Do I make myself clear?
And one more thing! I will hear no more talk of adoptions! None of you riff-raff is getting adopted. Ever! Nobody needs you, nobody wants you.
That, my darlings, is why you're here. Why you will always be here, until the day you come of age and get thrown into that wide, horrible world.
Fish? Again?
Eat up, Svari.
Potatoes? Again?
Maybe we'll have better luck tomorrow.
It's all we've got for today. Don't be greedy.
We'll make it, Greta. We always have so far...
Good on you.
You better. I hate people who waste my time.
Really? I'd be happy to show you a bit about herbs if you find the book.
You'd do that? If you find one, I could teach you a thing or two about trading. Help you get a fair bargain in the future.
Here she is.
Here you go.
Hold, there!
Halt, outlander!
Lay down your weapons!
Surrender or die, outlander!
Clanfolk, stop the outlander!
I do indeed.
Her name is Muiri. I need you to talk to her, set up the contract, and carry it out.
The girl's been running her mouth, wants an ex-lover killed. She's apparently performed the Black Sacrament.
You must go to the city of Markarth, and speak with the apothecary's assistant. You'll probably find her in The Hag's Cure, when the shop is open.
I guess not.
I hate them.
That's my boy.
Why did they do that? Why would they be so evil?
Eirid says the mages at the College are nice people, but you said they're bad.
Eirid's a little girl who doesn't understand that they're responsible for destroying our home.
Because they don't care about you or I, cub. They think they're better than all of us, and that we can just be thrown away.
I know that!
I understand, mother. Forgive me.
Sibbi? He's in prison... you put him there.
I can promise you when he's ready, he'll find the cell door unlocked.
Hemming, I need you to bring a note to Sibbi. I need him to do something for me.
Why do you tolerate him, mother? All he contributes to this family is embarrassment and disgrace.
I tolerate your son because he'll do anything I ask, without question. I'd expect the same from my own son.
I'm sorry...
Alms? Alms for a veteran?
Here, it's all I can spare...
Spare a bite for a poor old veteran?
We barely have enough for ourselves...
Please, ma'am, I've got nowhere to go...
I lost my eye defending the Empire... Spare some grub for a veteran?
Indeed I do.
It's tough, with just the two of us.
There's hardly ever time to make the occasional delivery to the taverns of Skyrim.
We could use a pair of hands and a strong back. There'd be a little coin in it for you.
Is that you?
I prayed to Mara and she spoke to me in a dream. She said a stranger would appear to help me.
It does not.
I want you to talk to Sibbi for me. Then, I want you to bring me Frost and the Lineage Papers that prove the horse's worth.
Ah, well, I recently approached Sibbi Black-Briar about buying Frost, one of the finest breeding horses in Skyrim. He agreed to sell.
I paid Sibbi half the cost of Frost up front, but before he could deliver, Maven had him locked up. Sibbi believes this exempts him from our deal.
It's Grelod!
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Die, Grelod! Die!
Well? Is it done?
Aiiiiiiieeeeeeee!!
So... very tired...
You don't scare me.
Ha ha ha ha ha! Hooray!
Grelod the Kind. Is she... you know?
It's Honorhall Orphanage, in Riften.
You've come at last! I knew you would!
Finally! My prayers have been answered!
Someone has killed Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Riff-raff! That's all you Riften people are!
You've taken up enough of my time. Now leave.
We love you, Dark Brotherhood! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Grelod is dead! Aventus did it! Ha ha ha ha ha!
You're trying to frighten me, hmm? Do your worst!
This is an orphanage, not an inn. Begone from here.
Hooray! Grelod the Kind is dead at last! We're saved!
What do you want? You have no business being in here!
Please don't kill Constance Michel. She really is kind.
Grelod is the headmistress of Honorhall Orphanage. But not for long.
Think you can intimidate me? In my own orphanage? Ha! Not bloody likely.
Aventus really did it! He got the Dark Brotherhood to kill old Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Please... How long must I do this? I keep praying, Night Mother. Why won't you answer me?
Grelod, you old crone. You'll get what you deserve. The Dark Brotherhood will see to that...
Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.
Please hurry. To be honest, I'm kind of lonely here. As much as I hated getting sent to Honorhall, I really miss my friends there...
It's just...
The... Gourmet?
Oh! Finally! When I heard the Gourmet was being brought in to cook for the Emperor, I could hardly believe it.
Let's see...
Where oh where did you get this? Don't answer - I don't want to know.
Look, it ain't my business ta tell the Dark Brotherhood its business, but if you killed a member of the Elder Council, you'd better belie-
This is an amulet of the Emperor's Elder Council. Specially crafted for each member. Worth a small fortune. Ain't somethin' you'd give up lightly.
Long enough.
Master, I...
Well why do I have to listen to Skjor, then?
My title is Harbinger, child. I am no man's master.
Forgive me. You're just the one in charge, and it's what I'm used to.
Skjor has been a warrior for a long time. You would be wise to listen to him.
No one is in charge here. Each Shield-Brother is his own man, each Shield-Sister her own woman.
Any warrior that gets to be old is either fearsome or a coward. I'll let you find out which Skjor is.
Mu los vomir

We are all in your debt, Dragonborn.
You've done it... just as the prophecy said...
Goraan! I feel younger than I have in many an age.
Or will you merely fade from history, unremembered?
Or will your name be a curse to future generations?
But that is for the gods to decide. You have done your part.
But willing or no, they will hear it! Fare thee well, Dovahkiin!
Now it is up to you to decide what to do with your power and skill.
Zu'u Odahviing. Call me when you have need, and I will come if I can.
Will you be a hero whose name is remembered in song throughout the ages?
Thank you. Thank you, Dragonborn. You've done a great service for us all.
I'm afraid she's right. I'm deeply sorry that this has to come between us.
I hope you will return to us soon with the news that justice has finally been done.
With both Alduin and Paarthurnax dead, a dark chapter in history will finally be closed.
He may be permitted to return at the end of time to fulfill his destiny as the World-Eater.
But our oath as Blades binds us. Paarthurnax must die. There's no excuse now that Alduin is dead.
I knew you could do it... I believed in you, and yet... I still didn't think I'd live to see this day.
And so Alduin's lordship passes to you. Thuri, Dovahkiin. I gladly submit to your mastery of the Thu'um.
But just as Paarthurnax's later deeds do not expiate his crimes, your deeds do not allow us to ignore our duty.
Perhaps, perhaps not. Dragons are not like normal mortal creatures, and Alduin is unique even among dragonkind.
There's still the matter of Paarthurnax. I'm not ungrateful for what you've done. Esbern speaks for both of us.
As for myself, you've proven your mastery twice over. Thuri, Dovahkiin. I gladly acknowledge the power of your Thu'um.
You've shown yourself mighty, both in Voice and deed. In order to defeat Alduin, you've gained mastery of dreadful weapons.
Many of the dovahhe are now scattered across Keizaal. Without Alduin's lordship, they may yet bow to the vahzen... rightness of my Thu'um.
Let the Way of the Voice be your guide, and the path of wisdom will be clear to you. Breath and focus, Dragonborn. Your future lies before you.
My pleasure.
No. I don't.
Fine. I did notice something odd last time we handed out the pay. Little extra slip of paper for Weylin. Took it right to his room after he got it.
No. I'm not.
Was is that obvious? Damn. I must be losing my touch.
No. Not yet.
You're sure?
There we are!
Only a couple more.
Come in. Quickly now.
This'll just take a moment...
That's better. Now we can talk.
This one always sticks... there we go.
Come in, come in! Make yourself at home!
He's in the Flagon right now. Get ready.
She's in the Flagon right now. Get ready.
Come in, come in. Too many ears out there.
Doesn't matter. We'll kill them either way.
Please. Come in. Musn't talk in the Ratway.
Of course I'm sure! He was asking about Esbern.
Of course I'm sure! She was asking about Esbern.
You'd better clear out before someone gets hurt.
Alduin has returned, just like the prophecy said!
Well, I guess that's good enough... let's be off...
And now you pay for meddling in the Thalmor's affairs.
That's her! That's who was asking about Esbern! Kill her!
That's him! That's who was asking about Esbern! Kill him!
Yes! Yes! You see, you know but you refuse to understand!
But, give me... just a moment... I must gather a few things...
The Dragon from the dawn of time, who devours the souls of the dead!
You're in the wrong place to be asking those kind of questions, pal.
The Blades knew, once upon a time. Alduin's Wall is the key. Yes, yes!
I'll need this... No, no, useless trash... where'd I put my annotated Anuad?
Where is he? The one who was asking about the fugitive hiding in the Ratway?
The answer ain't gonna be any different the next time. Arrogant elven bastard.
Don't move. Don't move. I have it here, somewhere... never thought it would be any use, but now...
He lives somewhere in the Ratway Warrens. Must be crazy or desperate to live down there. Maybe both.
Crazy old coot, from what I've heard. For that to stand out down here, he must really be off his nut.
He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Hardly ever leaves the place - has someone bring him food and such.
Haven't you figured it out yet? What more needs to happen before you all wake up and see what's going on?
That one right there, walking out the door. He was one of them asking about that old man you're looking for.
Your lack of cooperation has been noted. We'll be back if we require further information. You won't get a second chance.
One moment, I know, time is of the essence, but mustn't leave secrets for the Thalmor... there's one more I must bring...
No one can escape his hunger, here or in the afterlife! Alduin will devour all things and the world will end. Nothing can stop him!
Now be gone.
Your own fate will be your own choice. Just as always.
Now get out.
This is my business. My city. You Empire lovers should learn to stay out of it.
The Imperial agent? That's right. I knew. How many dogs is the Empire going to send after me?
Now you die!
You should never have come here!
Speak, worm!
What? What treachery! Defiler! Debaser and defiler! You have violated the sanctity of the Night Mother's coffin! Explain yourself!
Take a look.
See for yourself.
Just what you see here.
The finest weapons and armor.
Let's sate that appetite, hmm?
I've got some wonderful jewelry.
Ah, so you're an alchemist, then?
Oh, a bit of this and a bit of that.
Beautiful things for beautiful people.
Bow and arrows for the mighty huntsman.
Depends. Are you thirsty, hungry, both?
Everything I've got on display, really.
So, you wish to master the arcane arts...
Drink for the thirsty, food for the hungry.
Trinkets, odds and ends, that sort of thing.
Usual guild rate. Let's take a look at them.
An archer, eh? Oh, I've got just what you need.
Clothes and raiment for the discerning customer.
Let see what adornments I might have available...
Looking to protect yourself, or deal some damage?
So you're interested in my potions and ingredients?
Some may call this junk. Me, I call them treasures.
Breeches, gowns... clothes for any occasion, really.
Let's see if we can't find an outfit that suits you.
What are you hunting? Never mind. I don't want to know.
Got a pretty full stock of potions and alchemy reagents.
Spells and incantations for those with the talent to cast them.
Hmm... Blades, helmets. Pretty much anything to suit your needs.
I've got coin and I've got merchandise. Let's see what we can do.
Hmph. I had you figured for a mage. I think you'll appreciate this...
I give special rates to members of the Thieves Guild. Show me what you've got.
Why don't you take a look at some of my merchandise and we'll see what kind of a deal we can make.
This is fun.
You look strong.
Thank you again for all the help.
Sometimes I just like to watch them burn.
We will see.
What future?
Don't think so.
I won't say no to that.
I guess I can spare him a few beatings. Deal.
Works for me. Tell Octieve the debt's settled.
The only thing I understand is you bothering you.
I'm not about to take on debts from some milk drinker I don't know.
This isn't about me paying Iddra back, this is about me being able to pay her back with my own coin.
Bribing me? Well, a bard does need to eat. On my ancestor's honor, I won't trouble sweet Carlotta again.
A true Nord would settle it himself, but at least this way Iddra gets her coin. Thank you. Tell her I'll be fine.
Paying the wages yourself? Well, I won't say no to gold. By my family's honor, this money will go to the Argonian workers.
What rumors?
Well, if the shoe fits...
Hey. What's the matter with you? You have no right to spread rumors around town about me.
You know very well what I'm talking about. You're saying that I only married Bolli for his gold and that I don't really love him.
What the...?
Aedra, what a day!
...As you say, sir.
Sir, are you serious?
What do you think this is?
Everyone, fall back! Run for it!
No, no! This can't be happening!
Yes, I'm positive I heard something.
What a waste! There must be a dozen men up there!
You heard me, captain- our work must not be disturbed.
I'll deal with my uncle. Just... go! Scour this place from top to bottom!
Well, at least this post is safe enough. Come on, let's get back to work.
Kill any intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need it. But let no one through.
'Accidents' like this don't just happen! Someone is trying to sabotage my uncle's research!
All right men, spread out and search the tower. No telling who- or what- we're dealing with here.
Calcelmo's orders- no one gets through to the tower. Kill any intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need to.
I... oh, all right. If there is a thief, he won't leave this tower alive. But shouldn't we inform Master Calcelmo?
Yeah. Calcelmo called in his entire expedition team- said he needed every man he could get to protect his research.
Another trap, most likely. Things are dangerous... three of the guards died when the lower hall flooded with steam last week.
Better them than us. We lost three good men to the traps up there, and for what- just to see another damn spider clanking around?
What's that?
It is time, Yamarz.
What? What is this?
Fine, it's your neck.
You pathetic weakling!
Don't make a mess of this.
Now, we begin the ritual...
Why are you here, outsider?
You dare summon me, Yamarz?
Let's just get this over with.
Why are we bothering with this?
Do you bring word from Malacath?
You should not be here, outsider.
You must help us appease Malacath.
Grrr. Fine, let's get this over with.
Please hurry. We are counting on you.
Ugor, no! This may be the one we need.
By the Ashpit, we can't go on like this.
Malacath has heard my pleas! He speaks to us!
I'll lead the way, but you'd better back me up.
I must focus now. This ritual is very important.
Speak to Yamarz. Convince him to let you help him.
Very well. You, outsider, come here! I want a word.
We have angered Malacath, and so we must be punished.
Halt! You have no business here, outsider. Leave at once.
If there's a chance this will save me, then I'm taking it.
We need nothing from outsiders! Yamarz will provide for us.
Curses aren't enough, now must I suffer you too? What is it?
Do whatever Yamarz asks of you. It cannot make things worse.
Great Malacath, we beseech you, aid us in our time of need...
So it will be. Malacath has spoken, Yamarz. Your path is clear.
I will stay right here and wait for you to bring me what I need.
Please, help Yamarz. Do whatever you can. Our tribe depends on you.
So he has been punished? And what of us? What fate shall we suffer?
But, you took care of him and the giants. Two problems solved at once.
Our tribe has survived this long without you interfering. We'll be fine.
We have sworn loyalty to Yamarz. He will see us through these dark times.
Yamarz was a fool. Always trying to scheme his way out of responsibility.
Doing nothing will not grant our tribe relief from this curse. We must try.
We cannot carry on this way! You know we are doomed if we do not do something!
Yamarz was a coward and a weakling. His deceitful ways have cost you all greatly.
Yamarz charged me with keeping outsiders away from Largashbur. You would have me disobey him?
You, place that hammer on the shrine. You're the only one who's proven worthy in all of this...
Well, the giants took care of him, and you took care of the giants. Two problems solved at once.
You don't deserve to call yourself an Orc! You're weak, you're small, and you're an embarrassment!
Now, take Shagrol's hammer back to Largashbur, and we'll see about whipping the rest of them into shape.
You were charged with keeping us inside the walls. Have faith, Ugor. I only wish the best for our tribe.
You'll have to prove yourselves, but I'm willing to give you a chance. Gularzob's in charge now. Let's hope he's a better chief.
You bring an outsider here, and now insist I call on Malacath for help, when he has clearly forsaken me? You try my patience, Atub.
You let giants... Giants!... overrun my shrine. Bring me their leader's club as an offering, and I might release you from this curse!
What's this?
I guess some things never change. Thanks for bringing this to me. Here, for your trouble.
Yeah. Right.
Papa, the next time you go away, I want to come with you.
When I go away, I go to war. That's no place for a little girl.
Every knight needs a squire. I could help you with your sword, things like that.
Nice try, blossom, but I'm not a knight, I'm a mercenary. The answer's still no. Besides, your mother would miss you too much.
Yes, father.
Groom her, too?
You know I did.
You clean out that muck?
You shoe that gelding, boy?
Don't suppose there is. But you don't have to be so damned prickly.
Yes, father, I did. And I watered her, and got fresh feed, and refitted the old saddle, just like you asked. Is there anything else?
Yes, indeed.
Yes, Legate.
We should go over our strategy again in case the Stormcloaks attack.
Maybe you're right. I guess the battles I won yesterday won't win today's wars.
Considering how the Great War ended, I think we need to be cautious about what we rely on.
I'm sorry, Legate. I didn't want to imply anything about your ability to lead. You're a hero to the Empire, and I....
Oh, don't be such an old stick, Horik. I was joking. I can do that, you know. Redo the battle plans. I'll look over them later.
I don't think that's needed, Horik. It's the same strategy we used for every major defense during the Great War. It'll serve just as well now.
Yes, mother.
No, no. Just watch over him.
Good. He must be kept safe from harm.
You are looking after your brother, yes?
What sort of harm? Have you had a vision?
Yes, Mulush.
I don't want any of you thieving workers even thinking about stealing any silver.
If I see you sneaking off with even one speck of silver, I'll break your leg and throw you into the river.
You made it!
We need to get inside. Follow me!
Come on! We need to get inside before that dragon comes back!
You're back.
You're dumb.
Alik'r, hold!
What is this?
What have you done?
Please, let's hurry.
Quickly, come with me.
Any news of the Alik'r?
We will find her eventually.
We meet at last, my dear lady.
Do you have news of our quarry?
She cannot hide from us forever.
I can't believe it's come to this.
Please, we need to speak in private.
I mean it! I'll... I'll cut you in half!
If you locate her, find us in Rorikstead.
I really thought you'd be able to save me.
Let's get to the stables before they find me.
We're looking for someone. Maybe you can help.
You're not one of those Alik'r thugs, are you?
Find me the moment the Alik'r are taken care of.
I think you and I have some things to talk about.
Keep it to yourself. They're not paying us to talk.
The Alik'r are not permitted within the city walls.
Can you help me find someone? There's gold in it for you.
I have some questions for you. I'm trying to find someone.
By decree of the Jarl, the Alik'r are banned from Whiterun.
Thank you for your trust. I am eager to return to my homeland.
You've proven your strength, warrior. Let's avoid any more bloodshed.
I'm not sure I like these Alik'r warriors hiding out here. They seem like trouble.
The resistance against the Dominion is alive and well in Hammerfell, and they want justice.
The other noble houses discovered her betrayal and she fled. They want her brought back alive.
They'll be gone as soon as they've found whoever they're looking for. And we'll have all the more coin.
Oh, come now. You didn't really expect to manipulate people forever, did you? Your luck had to run out sometime.
So, are you working with them? You think you can take me? You so much as touch me, and you're going to lose fingers.
She sold the city out to the Aldmeri Dominion. Were it not for her betrayal, Taneth could have held its ground in the war.
All the time.
Don't you ever wonder, father?
But your aunts don't even seem to care.
I've just never heard of a midwife losing all her mothers like that.
They are good women. They love me. You will speak no more ill of them.
And stay out.
Damn outsiders.
Don't come back.
I have metal to dig.
Outlanders should mind their own business.
You have no business in our stronghold, outlander.
We won't kill you, outlander, but we don't want you here.
Malacath blesses this land for the Orcs. And the Orcs alone.
I'm here to mine, outlander. So unless you want to dig, get out.
It's late outlander. Come back in the morning if you need to spend coin.
Every Orc learns the heavy labor of mining. All spend years in the caves.
The mines are hard, but Malacath rewards those who rise to the challenge.
We only trade during the day, outlander. At night, most rest in the longhouse.
Malacath has given me the task to mine. Good ore brings strength to our people.
Most of my kin are in the longhouse. Come back during the day if you wish to trade.
Are we clear?
I am Savos Aren, Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold.
I am quite content to see nearly any aspect of magic explored and investigated here.
But I do not and will not approve of any research or experiments that cause purposeful harm to your fellow members of the College.
Are you sure?
Uncle Calcelmo....
Stop bothering me Aicanter!
Um, no. Nothing. Nothing at all.
I just wanted to know if you needed anything.
What is it nephew? Can't you see I'm trying to think here?
Back to work.
Come visit again sometime.
Good luck finding those jazbay grapes, they're very rare.
Better honey?
How much do you know about the brewing of mead?
I know all there is to know about the drinking of it, and that suits me just fine.
There has to be more to it than that, though. I wish I knew where the bees got it from.
I've been trying to figure out what makes Riften mead better than the stuff from Whiterun.
Come on, now.
Don't just stand there.
What are you waiting for?
Come at me. You couldn't hurt me if you wanted to.
Die, you dog!
Which one is that?
It's time to die, dog.
I can smell your shame!
Death to the beastblood!
Your mistake, Companion.
You're going to regret this.
We knew you'd be coming here.
Well, look what we have here.
I'll rip you apart, Companion!
Ysgramor would be ashamed of you!
None of you will be alive to tell it.
Killing you will make for an excellent story.
It doesn't matter. He wears that armor, he dies.
It doesn't matter. She wears that armor, she dies.
Easy does it.
I'll follow your lead.
Come on. Sounds like trouble.
Looks like we're on our own now.
I think we're almost out. Come on!
We'd better stick together down here.
There may be a way out, down this way.
Let's see if we can find a way out of here.
Don't worry. We'll get out of here, somehow.
Look around. Grab anything that looks useful.
Find yourself a weapon. You're going to need it.
I hate those things. Too many eyes or something.
These bastards call themselves Imperial Legionnaires...
I can't decide if things are about to get worse or better.
Let's see where this goes. We can't be the only survivors.
I guess that'll teach me to try to reason with a Stormcloak.
I'm glad to be out of that place. I hope this leads somewhere.
At least we don't have a dragon to worry about, for the moment.
Let's take our time. I think we can sneak by her if we're careful.
We must be near the entrance for that bear to have made its den here.
Since nobody's trying to kill me just now, maybe we should rest for a minute.
We'd better get out of here. I don't think this place is going to stand up to much more of this.
Fight! Fight!
Not so tough now, are you?
You want a real fight, eh?
Come on, he's not so tough.
Come on, she's not so tough.
Twelve septims on the big one!
Don't let her get away with this!
Don't let him get away with this!
Come on. Let's see what you're made of.
Drive that snowback to the ground. Come on!
Who taught you to fight? Keep those hands up!
You just going to stand there and take it? Fight back.
You're tougher than you look. You got me, fair and square.
I didn't mean nothing by it! Just... leave me alone! What do you want?
For Dawnstar!
For Lady Mara!
They mustn't stop us!
We fight till the last!
Time for your final rest!
Take heed! They've awakened!
...not dead? Kill them, kill them all!
By Her Benevolence, you shall not stop us!
...dreaming... Defilers! Kill the defilers!
...the Miasma... They're still here! Stop them!
...s-sleeping? No! Burn the temple! Kill the priests!
...w...what happened? Wait! We're still under attack!
..wha?... where?... D-destroy this place! Tear it apart!
For Kynareth!
Scourge of nature!
Good morning.
Oh. Well. Good day.
Bah. What's so good about it, hmm?
Good to hear.
Goodness, no!
He's perfectly polite, if a bit guarded.
They're simply scholars, they mean no one harm. I've had... several conversations with Arch-Mage Aren over the years.
Got any work?
Shoo! Go away! You get nothing from me.
I ain't begging. I just need a job. Anything.
You bother me again, maybe you will not walk away. Understand?
Sorry, I have everyone I need at the warehouse. Times are tight.
Hello, Nirya.
Ah, err, yes. Sorry.
Don't even talk to me, Gane.
Here to mine?
Plenty of iron to dig.
Oh, do you need a room?
Here to dig. That's all.
Stay out of trouble, now.
Come back if you need steel.
I work steel, weapons mostly.
My only aim is to keep the peace.
My duty is to guard Brina Merilis.
Thoring runs the inn. Speak to him.
Watch your hands around the Legate.
Back to another fine day in Dawnstar.
If it's about the mine, I'm all ears.
Why are you speaking to me, Imperial?
I will serve Dawnstar as I always have.
Quicksilver ore is rare. Worth digging.
My miners are as dumb as rocks are grey.
Need a dagger? No? How about a claymore?
We forge every day if you need anything.
Don't bother me again unless it's important.
I work in the mine, just like everyone else.
Let me know if you come down with the Rattles.
A Stamina Potion maybe? Popular with young men.
Been working in Iron-Breaker since I was a boy.
Mining's an honest trade. No real tricks to it.
Damn Imperials. They won't hold Dawnstar forever.
I mine. Work the smelter. Ain't much else to tell.
I've been in charge of Dawnstar for over 35 years.
Once sailing gets in your blood, it don't get out.
Frost took my husband years ago. He was a good man.
You should talk to Rustleif. Get some proper steel.
I'm here to lend my magic to the people of Dawnstar.
You should leave. Skald gets upset around Imperials.
I'm just one of the miners. I don't want any trouble.
Skald is very... vocal about his hatred of the Empire.
What do you want, Imperial? Ain't my life hard enough?
I work for the Windpeak Inn. You should head on inside.
I'll forge you a weapon tomorrow. Right now, I'm closed.
I'm Skald's housecarl and head of his guard in Dawnstar.
Cap'n Wayfinder's as green as seaweed, but he's learnin'.
I've been in the Legion all my life. I'm content to serve.
I don't like taking orders from a boy, but I need the gold.
Iron's a good, stout metal. A fine thing for a Nord to dig.
Let me know if you need a drink. That's what we're here for.
My family has served Skald Felgeif's family for generations.
Sorry if my father seems a bit distracted. A lot's happened.
My wife Beitild is dead. Can't say I miss that old sabre cat.
You should speak to the Jarl if you need something, stranger.
My children all grew up and left Dawnstar to make their fortune.
I hear people were spotted using the Black Door. Gods have mercy.
The Windpeak Inn features the finest bard in all of Dawnstar. Me.
I help my husband Rustleif run the forge. He's a marvel with steel.
Been mining all my life. Quicksilver is as much my home as anywhere.
No Empire is going to take the Jarlship away from this Son of Skyrim.
Horik and I have lived here ever since I retired. He's a good soldier.
Dawnstar's got its problems, but as long as the ore is good, I'll stay.
I'm sorry. My mind was just somewhere else. Did you need a room? Drink?
Just a servant of Skald the Elder. Not worthy of time or consideration.
You looking for a shield? Best thing between you and the enemy, friend.
Most of the guards in Dawnstar carry swords forged from his very smithy.
Skyrim will not bow to a false king any longer. Ulfric is the true king.
Dangerous post, Dawnstar. If the bandits don't get you, the animals will.
Jarl gets booted from Dawnstar, and I'm still stuck cleaning up the dirt.
Beitild thinks I drink on the job. Well, what does it matter if I do? Huh?
I plan to spend all the days I got left on the water. It's where I belong.
The Mortar and Pestle has cures for every illness, from Ataxia to Witbane.
I married Rustleif when he was in Hammerfell, apprenticing under my father.
I served in the Great War as a Legion battlemage. I've no desire to go back.
I'm no one special, just a miner who swings a pickaxe for his drinking money.
Used to be twice as many miners working here before all this trouble started.
We won't give up this port to the Imperials without a fight, don't you worry.
I traveled far and wide when I was younger. Glad to have settled down finally.
Don't forget getting a good pair of gauntlets. Broken hands can't hold a sword.
My husband Leigelf is dead. I... I never thought I would miss that oaf so much.
Oh, it's just wonderful being Skald's servant. He's not demanding in the least.
The tenacity of the Imperial Legion is legendary. We need to be ready for them.
Dawnstar is the last port of call before Solitude. Damn rebels aren't taking it.
I been a sailor for so long, I could navigate these rivers an' seas blindfolded.
My daughter Karita sings to the guests when she can. She has her mother's voice.
The Jarl and I have our disagreements. Sorry if you had to overhear one of them.
Old lady Frida is a grouch, but she sure can whip up a cure for the Rattles fast.
There's no honor in being a Jarl's servant. No Sovngarde waits for dust cleaners.
Beware of Frostmere Crypt, friend. Heard some bandits are living in the ruins now.
I wasn't born in Skyrim, but when I served in the Legion this land became my home.
I'll work my spells and potions for whoever is willing to leave Dawnstar in peace.
We discovered recently that I am with child. I'll need to stop working next season.
I had hoped life would be simpler here, but war seems to find a way of following me.
I trained in Hammerfell during my journeyman years. Redguard smiths are second to none.
Everyone thinks I'm too young to be a ship's captain, but I'm going to prove them wrong.
Giants have been spotted up near Red Road Pass. Best to keep away and avoid it entirely.
The Pale will throw those Imperial backbiters up against the wall when they come for us.
Iron-Breaker Mine is three times the worth of that Quicksilver Mine and its fat-head owner.
Jarl Skald is upset over the loss of Dawnstar. I'll admit, it's less I have to worry about.
The only thing I dislike about my husband's homeland is the cold. Why is it always so cold?
I'm good with stars and charts, but I admit I've got some things to learn about leading men.
I served in the Great War against the Thalmor. I remember how bravely a Legionnaire can fight.
The nightmares in Dawnstar have lifted, and I hear you helped that happen. You have my thanks.
I inherited the ship when my mother passed away. She spent her life on the water, and now I do, too.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about finding a new ship. I guess it's easier just to stay put.
Quicksilver Mine is the best mine in Dawnstar, and you can tell those Iron-Breaker miners I said so.
You should see the grin on Horik's face now that we're in charge. I know he hides it, but I can tell.
The captain inherited the Sea Squall from his mother when she died. Maybe I can inherit the ship if he dies...
I could run this ship better than that boy who calls himself a captain. Maybe one day I'll do something about it.
I don't buy all that talk about ship captains having to be stern and strict. I want my crewmen to enjoy their work.
Here we go...
Sven, we need to talk...
Wonderful. And let's not have this chat again next week. Agreed?
It's about your singing. Well, not your singing, your songs. But you know what I'm talking about.
You do realize these simpletons wouldn't know real music if it bit them in the britches, hmm? Very well. Your wish is my command.
Here you are.
Spare a septim?
Here you go, dear.
Can you spare any coin?
Sorry, all out of coin.
Yes, I hope this helps.
Of course, here. Be well.
All right, all right. Here.
Certainly, good lady. Here.
Please help me, I'm starving.
Ugh, you reek. Get out of my way.
Get away from me, you filthy woman.
Please, I don't have anything to eat.
You must be starving. Here, spend it well.
Oh, very well. Just try and clean yourself up.
Are you joking? Go earn a living and stop loafing!
I would if I could, but I can barely make ends meet.
Please milady, can you spare a gold coin for an old woman?
Maybe you should look for work instead of begging for coin.
Please my lord, can you spare a gold coin for an old woman?
I've told you before, and I'll tell you again. Leave me alone.
Edda, you know well I barely have any coin to call my own. I'm sorry.
Yes, of course. This war is causing your woes, it's hardly your fault.
Oh you poor thing! Come by the temple and my husband and I will keep you fed.
Edda, Edda. There's no need for this. Just come by the temple and we'll care for you.
Hmm? Oh, yes.
Mercer, aren't you forgetting something?
Brynjolf will provide you with the details.
Mercer? This is the one I was talking about... our new recruit.
This better not be another waste of the Guild's resources, Brynjolf.
Goldenglow Estate is critically important to one of our largest clients.
You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If so, let her prove it.
You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If so, let him prove it.
Wait a moment, you're not talking about Goldenglow, are you? Even our little Vex couldn't get in.
Before we continue, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. If you play by the rules, you walk away rich.
You break the rules and you lose your share. No debates, no discussions... you do what we say, when we say.
Since Brynjolf assures me you'll be nothing but a benefit to us, then you're in. Welcome to the Thieves Guild.
However, the owner has suddenly decided to take matters into his own hands and shut us out. He needs to be taught a lesson.
Hmph. Plenty.
I'd say we're prosperous enough. Most folk don't go hungry, if they're willing to work hard.
The city's ruled by the Jarl up in Dragonsreach. That's the fortress, there, up on the tall hill.
But you're probably more interested in Jorrvaskr, mead hall of the Companions. Their deeds of war and valor are... legendary.
Hold still...
Excellent work!
Welcome to the College.
I'm trying to pay attention.
Do not cross the bridge unaided!
Very good. Then we're done here.
Mirabelle will be waiting for you.
I believe I've made myself rather clear.
No matter what, the College will endure.
Now, cast the ward spell, and keep it up.
Yes, of course. The Arch-Mage has my thanks.
Much knowledge lies within the College's walls.
Greetings. Welcome to the College of Winterhold.
Then what are we waiting for? Let's get started!
Here you are. Now I'm anxious to see you cast it.
Unless you can control it, it can and will destroy you.
After I've finished showing you the grounds, we can talk.
You risk death by doing so, and you shall not gain entry.
Oh, don't listen to her. We can do it, just give us a chance!
Oh, don't listen to him. We can do it, just give us a chance!
Our newest members are housed here in the Hall of Attainment.
Welcome, welcome! We were just beginning. Please, stay and listen.
You must first prove your worth, and then I shall lead you across.
Now, if you'll please follow me, I'll show you the living quarters.
Winterhold's glory days may lie behind it, but the College lives on.
How do you think we should spend the remainder of our classroom time?
See? He agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?
See? She agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?
All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical...
We don't anticipate any real violence, but it never hurts to be prepared.
Over there, please. Just opposite me. Wouldn't want anyone else in the way.
Initially you'll be learning from Tolfdir, one of our most esteemed Wizards.
The College is an asset to Skyrim, even if it goes unnoticed or unappreciated.
The College of Winterhold has been a fixture in Skyrim for thousands of years.
If you have any further questions, can you please hold them until I've finished?
The Arcanaeum is located above the hall, and the Arch-Mage's quarters above that.
Yes of course. I'm simply trying to understand the reasoning behind the decision.
You have to keep your ward up, or else this won't work. I don't want to hurt you.
I have responsibilities to attend to. We'll continue this discussion some other time.
Or you can try your luck with one of the court wizards around Skyrim. They also sell spells.
If it's true, and you do have the Voice, would you mind showing me? I've never seen it first-hand.
Sir, I think we all understand that fairly well. We wouldn't be here if we couldn't control magic!
I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can successfully use it to block spells, all right?
I suggest we meet there in a few hours, and see what awaits us inside. That's all for now, thank you.
We're all pretty new at this, right? Let's just give it a chance. What's the worst that could happen?
Well, I think this is an excellent start. I'd like you all to continue practicing with wards, please.
This is where you'll be staying. This bed and desk are yours. Please try and be considerate of others.
No? Well, if you think you're capable of it, then I'd be happy to provide it to you for a mere 30 gold.
I really do need you to stay in place, please. I don't want to risk hurting any of the other Apprentices.
I think perhaps we're ready to begin exploring some of the various applications of magic throughout history.
In continuing with our theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic.
You are a guest of the College, here at the pleasure of the Arch-Mage. I hope you appreciate the opportunity.
So, as I was saying, the first thing to understand is that magic is, by its very nature, volatile and dangerous.
What I'm talking about is true control, mastery of magic. It takes years, if not decades, of practice and study.
Now, let's go back to the Hall of the Elements, where most of the members gather for lectures and study sessions.
Unfortunately, we've had to implement more stringent entry procedures, due to some problems with the local Nords.
Of course, my dear. Of course. You all certainly possess some inherent natural ability. That much is not being questioned.
Now I'll show you to your quarters. You're going to be sharing space with your fellow Apprentices, who you'll meet shortly.
I'll ask that you please keep your voice down while inside, as others may be working on research or... delicate experiments.
The College has undertaken a fascinating excavation in the ruins of Saarthal nearby. It's an excellent learning opportunity.
You may be used to the Empire bowing to your every whim, but I'm afraid you'll find the Thalmor receive no such treatment here.
Please, please! This is exactly what I'm talking about. Eagerness must be tempered with caution, or else disaster is inevitable.
Tolfdir is likely already addressing the new Apprentices. Go on in, and if you have any problems, let one of our senior members know.
But we've only just arrived here -- you've no idea what any of us are capable of. Why not give us a chance to show you what we can do?
The prominent feature here is the Hall of the Elements. It's our primary location for lectures, practice sessions, and general meetings.
While technically in charge of the College, the Arch-Mage's responsibilities often keep him occupied. Thus, I run the day-to-day operations.
How dare you!
I am honored.
Malacath is pleased with your strength, Larak.
I thought so.
I understand.
Indeed it is.
There are many valuable artifacts all through the temple.
It always is.
The boy has a nugget of truth, but the reality is more complicated than that.
It will pass.
Let me tell you how I see it.
I'm sure I know what this is about.
She thinks she's in love with Bassianus and wants to leave town. With him.
Until a few months ago, the girl was head over heels for Klimmek. Wouldn't stop talking about him.
Now if I thought she was really in love with Bassianus, that would be one thing. But she's a child.
Just go away!
Leave me alone, Braith...
Oh look, it's little baby Battle-Born.
What are you gonna do if I don't? Huh? Gonna cry to your papa?
Just name it.
Of course, Listener. What is it?
Does it involve sneaking and stabbing? Ooh, please say yes!
Lead the way!
That's a fair price. My blade is yours.
You have chosen wisely. Lead on, and I shall follow.
My blade is sharp and I thirst for battle. Onward, then!
With a master of magic at your side, you'll have nothing to fear.
You seem to be a little short on coin. Come back and see me when you've got the gold.
What dangers and wonders shall we discover in the frozen wastes? I can hardly wait to find out!
Lead the way.
I'm ready to go!
Once more into danger!
Alright, then. Let's go.
My blade is yours once more.
Good, I can use the exercise. Haha!
Looks like you've got some help already. I'll join you, but you'll have to let your comrade go. What do you say?
Like a stone.
Good morning, wife.
Take care, husband.
Hello, husband. You slept well?
Ah. Uh. Of course I'm not just rising. You must have been out when I woke up.
Well, I'd better get to work. I have to fix another saw blade for Gerdur's mill.
Hello, husband. You're rising late. You spent too long at the Sleeping Giant last night, didn't you?
Look at that.
That someone would attack Jorrvaskr... it's unthinkable.
Maybe, but...
We're the ones he loves. Me, and you.
He's been spending a lot of time at the graves again.
Bah. He never had a connection with any of them beyond what his loins told him.
Be careful. The spirits can speak to the living if there's a strong connection.
Good. The more time he pines for the dead wives, the less time he spends finding a new one.
No, don't go!
No, don't go! You may not be one of our tribe, but you are an Orc nonetheless!
No. He isn't.
Oh, I'm sorry to keep you. Head right in.
Now, go away.
Walk away. Now.
Now, get of my way.
If you're smart, you'll walk away.
And so, you will die a heretic's death.
Perhaps there's something you wish to confess?
This doesn't concern you, [QUOTE]citizen.[QUOTE]
You're interfering with official Thalmor business.
And now you'll walk away, if you know what's good for you.
Oh, Astrid...
By Sithis, what... what happened?
Nazir told me what happened in Solitude. You poor dear. You've been through so much...
Oh. Oh I see.
Well, you're makin' friends all over, ain't ya?
Ah, but business! Of course. What kind of business?
Ah, but we can discuss that later, yeah? What does the Brotherhood need?
So, uh... how is Astrid doing' these days? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up.
Well now, how is Astrid doin' these days, uh? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up.
Praise Talos!
Damn Elves! You'll pay for this!
Release...me.
Safe travels.
Slen Tiid Vo!
Close the door.
For the Blades!
Now we can talk.
We need to talk.
Right. Happy trails.
So you really are...
Take that thing down!
Come and face me, then!
Come on, close the door.
Wait. Something's wrong.
We'd better keep moving.
Attack while it's landed!
Hiding will not save you!
Geh, Sahloknir, kaali mir.
Don't let it get too close!
I'll be damned, you did it!
Sahloknir, krii daar joorre.
I do not fear you, Dovahkiin!
Just close the door, will you?
Sahloknir! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
This is worse than I thought...
Come on! This is our best chance!
We've got to ground that bastard!
There's no time to waste. Let's go.
It's to be a real fight, then. Good!
Come on. Hurry. We might be too late.
Now it's my turn, you son of a bitch.
Your Voice is strong... for a mortal.
My Voice has been silent for too long!
Come on. We've got to get to Kynesgrove.
Dohaviin, your Voice is no match for mine!
I am Sahloknir! Hear my Voice and despair!
Wait. Something's happening... gods above!
Keep a sharp lookout. We can't afford any delays.
That's better. Let's get on the road to Kynesgrove.
Ful, losei Dovahkiin? Zu'u koraav nid nol dov do hi.
I... it's true, isn't it? You really are Dragonborn.
I see that mortals have become arrogant while I slept.
Alduin, thuri! Boaan tiid vokriiha suleyksejun kruziik?
We need to find the burial mound. Let's ask in the inn.
Orgnar. I'm travelling. You've got the inn 'til I get back.
My lord Alduin requires your death. I am glad to oblige him.
Steady. I don't know what's happening. Let's watch and wait.
You'll be back. If you're really Dragonborn, this is your destiny.
Come on. Let's go see if there's a mythical dragon buried up there.
I hope you're Dragonborn, I really do. But we'll find out soon enough.
We need to find that burial mound before its dragon comes back to life.
You're the only one that can kill a dragon permanently by devouring its soul.
We remember what most don't - that the Dragonborn is the ultimate dragonslayer.
I doubt the Thalmor are aware of you yet. So we should be safe from them, at least.
You know where to find me when you change your mind. Because you will. You have to.
It's what I do. I make things happen from behind the scenes. After all, here you are.
That was well done. Come on. I've been wanting a closer look at one of these buggers.
Lorkhan's eyes! Look at that big bastard! Keep your head down, let's see what it does.
Kynesgrove is this way. We can travel together or split up and meet there, your choice.
Remember, we're not looking for trouble. We need to get to Kynesgrove as fast as we can.
You should know. You got the map for me. The dragonstone you got for Farengar, remember?
So you were paying attention. I arranged to have Farengar recover the dragonstone for me.
I didn't go to all this trouble on a whim. I needed to make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap.
Better to stick together. I don't want you to get yourself killed before we even get there.
Look around, see if you see anything unusual. Any signs of the mound being disturbed. Anything.
I'm part of a group that's been looking for you... well, someone like you, for a very long time.
If my analysis is correct, the dragon buried near Kynesgrove will be the next to come back to life.
You do not even know our tongue, do you? Such arrogance, to dare take for yourself the name of Dovah.
If you really are Dragonborn, that is. Before I tell you any more, I need to make sure I can trust you.
I shouldn't let you walk out of here, knowing what you know. But I guess even my paranoia has its limits.
I'm not your enemy. I already gave you the horn. I'm actually trying to help you. I just need you to hear me out.
We may both end up dead, but at least it gets me out of Riverwood. I don't really think I'm cut out for the quiet life.
The dragonstone was a map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear.
It seems to be spreading from the southeast, down in the Jeralls near Riften. The one at Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds.
Kynesgrove. There's an ancient dragon burial near there. If we can get there before it happens, maybe we'll learn how to stop it.
Spare a coin?
Very well, here.
No. Now shove off.
Never. Now move aside.
Sorry, no time. I'm late.
I could sure use some coin.
What? No. Get away from me.
Yes, I hope this helps you.
Certainly, my good man. Here.
Hey, can I get a gold or two?
Absolutely. Here you are. Be well.
Very well, please use it for food.
You're disgusting, stay away from me.
Again? Buy some food this time will you?
If you could spare a septim, I'd be grateful.
Ugh, you smell horrible. Get yourself cleaned up.
Help out an old man here with some coin, would you?
If I had even a pot to piss in, I'd gladly share. Sorry.
Oh if only I could provide more than this coin. I hope it'll do.
Snilf, it's me. I don't have a roof over my head either, remember?
Another uncounted causality of this war. Here you are, you poor man.
If you want to awaken from your next slumber, I suggest you leave me be.
Snilf, I told you begging isn't the answer. I expect to see you at the temple later.
I suppose. Just get something to eat and stay away from the Bee and Barb for a change.
Oh you poor thing, you must be starving. Come to the temple later and let us feed you.
Thanks again.
What's the plan?
You're gonna get me out of here?
There's more of them somewhere around here.
Thanks! I thought I was going to rot in here. So what's the plan?
There you go!
Pretty good arm you have there.
Very much so.
How would you like a drink?
So what's the news on the street, Captain?
The dark elves are uneasy. There's a killer on the streets. And Viola Giordano won't leave me alone.
Vittoria! No!
Aaaaiiiiieeee!
No! Noooooooo!
Honored guests.
What treachery?
My point exactly.
My wife is dead! Dead!
Please, enjoy yourself!
Good people of Solitude.
Good friends and neighbors.
I love weddings, don't you?
My daughter! Dead! Noooooo!
By the gods, the blood! The blood!
I never should have taken this job!
Oh, no no no... This is so wrong...
I didn't do it! You saw! I didn't do it!
I just came to sing! This is a horror show!
The bride has been murdered! Somebody help!
La la la, do do do do do, dum de dum dum...
What's going on? Why would somebody do that?
Make sure to get yourself something to drink.
If my Asgeir is happy, then I'm happy. Really.
Sorry, no time to talk. I need to keep playing.
You hungry? There's plenty of food. Eat up, now.
The Emperor's cousin is dead! This is a disaster!
This wedding is boring. I wish they had jugglers.
I just can't wait to be a bride someday. Someday...
Dum, di di dum, dum di dum, dum di di di di dum da da dum.
Now now, fella. Let's not get too close to my new bride, eh?
What my daughter sees in that... barbarian, I'll never know.
Ba ba ba, bum ba, ba ba ba, bum ba, ba da da da, dum da da...
If I'm really lucky, I'll get to kiss the bride for good luck.
By Ysmir, this is horrible! I never wanted the girl dead, I swear!
A marriage of both love and political advantage. A rare thing indeed.
I've eaten more in the last two hours than I have in the last two weeks.
The thought of paying a dowry to that, that... Stormcloak turns my stomach.
Well aren't you a pretty thing? Should my new bride by worried? He he he he.
I thank you all again for making this the best wedding a woman could ask for.
Long as I stay out of the way, the guards don't seem to care about me being here.
To think, my little boy is married. And to an Imperial. Oh, they grow up so fast.
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la. La la la, la la la la la laaaaaahhhh...
Vittoria did pretty well for herself, marrying that Asgeir. Not a bad looking fellow at all.
They say this marriage is the first step towards peace. Who in Shor's name wants peace? Pfft.
Are you all enjoying yourselves? Please, eat, drink, and make merry on this most happy of days.
When my aunt got married, they had a cake that was three feet tall. I got really sick that day.
My boy, he always did have an eye for the pretty ones. That Vittoria ain't bad, for an Imperial.
It was the Empire killed her! I know it! They killed her so they can blame it on the Stormcloaks!
May you all be as happy in your lives as I know I will be in mine. Thank you again for everything.
I still think my boy should have had a traditional Nord wedding. Outside, in the cool mountain air.
By all the gods, the groom has been killed. At his own wedding! I can only think of my own husband...
Ahem. Mi mi mi mi. Pardon me. Just, um, warming up. Never know when I may be called upon for a ballad.
Vittoria may be pretty, but does she have the right hips for the job? I want grandchildren, and lots of them.
I'm so glad Vittoria and Asgeir chose a public reception. That way the entire city can share in their holy bond.
Oh, did you miss the ceremony? It was rather quick, actually. The couple seemed more concerned with their reception.
I heard Vittoria Vici is the Emperor's cousin. I wish he came to the wedding. I never saw a real live Emperor before.
My husband Aesgir and I thank you for coming to our reception. We thank you for sharing the love we have for each other.
You have all helped make this a truly extraordinary wedding. All of my dreams have come true. So thank you. Thank you all.
My nephew, the Emperor. Too busy to attend the wedding of his beloved cousin. We won't stand for this slight, I assure you.
Please, enjoy the festivities! This is a day of peace and happiness, when Imperials and Stormcloaks join together, as equals!
My son is dead! At his own wedding! Only those Imperial dogs would have dared do something like this! Damn them all to Oblivion!
Why that's not the same thing at all. The Dominion were invaders. Conquerors. We had to fight them, to preserve our own way of life.
Oh, Asgeir! My husband! My dear, sweet husband! Why would someone do this to you? Why? This was supposed to be the happiest day of my life!
Typical Imperial rot. You speak of Skyrim like you know the land, know its people. You're from Cyrodiil! You know nothing about us! Nothing!
If you want my opinion, I think they should have paid for an entire quartet. Plenty of bards at the College would have loved the opportunity.
Oh, I know enough. I know those trouble-making Stormcloaks refuse to submit to Imperial authority. Such seditious behavior. Why it's treason!
And when the elves marched into your beloved Cyrodiil, and everyone took up arms against them, wasn't that treason? Against the Dominion? Huh?
Today, the problems of Skyrim are not my problems. Nor are they yours. Today we are joined in peace and happiness. So please, enjoy yourselves.
These days, it seems there is dread everywhere, whether it be war or dragon. But I beg you - here, today, put such fears aside. Enjoy yourselves!
In this courtyard, there are no Stormcloaks. There are no Imperials. There are only people, come to celebrate a union of two souls. So make merry!
I just wanted to take this time to thank you all for being here. To thank you for sharing this wonderfully happy day with myself, and my new husband.
Welcome home.
Who's asking?
Yeah, thanks.
Yes, my lady?
Anuriel, a word please.
Excellent, then they'll be no need to devote any resources to stopping it. Thank you, Anuriel. That will be all.
It's been brought to my attention that the poison known as skooma may be present in our city. What do you know of this?
I believe it to be a falsehood perpetrated by the Empire in order to weaken the citizen's confidence in your ability to rule.
You did what?
By the gods, you're serious. You'd better report this to Commander Maro right away. He's at the Penitus Oculatus outpost, up in Dragon Bridge.
You know him?
Are you sure you aren't a stranger?
Don't you remember? His name is Hroggar.
He made my favorite dolly, but I can't find her.
Alduin, thuri!
Alok, Nahagliiv. Tiid boaan.
Alok, Viinturuth. Tiid boaan.
Alok, Vuljotnaak. Tiid boaan.
Nahagliiv! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
Viinturuth! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
Vuljotnaak! Ziil gro dovah ulse!
Alright, then.
Do come again!
Farewell, then.
Good day to you.
It was a pleasure.
Take care, friend.
I enjoyed our talk.
Aye, 'til next time.
Right. See you around.
I bid you safe travels.
See you around, handsome.
Watch yourself out there.
May Talos bless your days.
See you around, my beauty.
Talos protect you, friend.
Thank you for your custom.
I hope to see you again soon.
Safe journeys, sword-brother.
Blessings of Arkay be upon you.
I'll see you again soon, I hope.
May Talos shield you from all harm.
A most pleasant chat. Until the next!
The Divines smile on a charitable soul.
Until our next meeting, honored friend.
Travel safely. It's dangerous out there.
Enjoy your stay, and don't break nothin'!
Never trade a sword for a hoe, my friend.
The streets are safer now, thanks to you.
Have a seat, there should be plenty of space.
I hope we will speak again soon, marsh-friend.
If you need another drink, I'll be right here.
A word of advice -- don't buy discounted armor.
May the earth beneath your feet be always soft.
If you'll excuse me, I must return to my duties.
Sorry about the smell. It's a stable, after all.
Battle reveals who a man really is. Remember that.
May you lose yourself in the pages of a good book!
Watch out some gray-skin doesn't pick your pocket.
It was a pleasure to talk to someone so interesting.
Don't forget them who's less fortunate than yourself.
I would not complain if you returned with some Skooma.
Be careful! That murderer could be anywhere, and anyone.
Whether it's armor you need or a new blade, come see me.
Fair winds and calm seas. That's an old sailor's parting.
A strong sword-arm wins battle, but a keen mind wins wars.
Be sure to stop by Sadri's Used Wares in the Gray Quarter.
Mind you don't put out that candle on the hearth upstairs!
If you've need of weapons or armor, come back and see Oengul.
Trust me, marsh-friend, you do not want to live in this city.
If you have need of tonics or potions, come see me at my shop.
Don't take anything for granted in life. Nothing lasts forever.
I should have been an adventurer like you, instead of a farmer.
Sometimes the difference between life an' death is a swift steed.
Keep on your guard. This city can be a little rough for those such us.
Too few remember to honor the god of the dead. Do not be one of those.
If you're not doing something you enjoy, then you're wasting your life.
If you meet anyone in your travels who needs good steel, send them my way.
Please forgive my mood. I'm still coming to terms with my daughter's death.
As you travel Skyrim, make sure you stop and take in the view from time to time!
Strength and steel are well and good, but magic is the true power in this world.
Please forgive my mood. I'm still coming to terms with the death of my wife and daughters...
And the blade?
Gettin' dull. We'll need a new one soon.
I'll talk to Alvor about getting us a new one.
Ay, it can. Wouldn't want them any bigger though.
Can the sawmill handle those logs? They look a might big.
Anything else?
Aye. I feared that was the case. From that last entry in Gallus's diary, it looks like he was getting close to exposing Mercer to the Guild.
Are they gone?
Please help. I can pay you.
Are you lost?
Are you ready to test yourself at Fort Hraagstad?
You survived Helgen? General Tullius told me what happened. Not many made it out alive...
I've got a good feeling about you. And I don't often get good feelings about anything. A warrior knows to trust her gut...
I'm not going to go through the normal process with you. I've got a little test lined up. Pass that, and we'll talk about you joining the Legion.
As you desire.
Stand in the center of the circle.
Burn the king!
Burn the King!
Tasty, sugary treats!
Come on! Light the fire!
There's the man himself!
I like the pretty lights.
There's the woman herself!
With the lighting of the effigy...
Best batch of Spiced Wine I ever had.
Get some Spiced Wine. A Festival Favorite.
Candy! Get your King Olaf's Festival candy!
Get your festival meat pie. Specially made.
You've done well by restoring our Festival.
Congratulations on getting the festival restored.
I thought the festival wasn't happening this year.
So nice to get this break from my cleaning duties.
Thanks for convincing Elisif to put this on again.
Can't have a meal without meat. Come and get some here.
I believe Sanguine would be pleased with this festival.
Spiced Wine here. First cup is paid for by the college.
Jorn is the best of the bunch, you should hear him sing.
I heard you're the reason we get to have this.  Thank you.
Try our meats made here at the Festival. They're the best.
Thank you so much. The festival has really increased my sales.
Meat Pies. Try one for free, come back for more. Get your meat pies.
You might as well have some sweets. I made them for the festival after all.
He becomes a full-fledged member of the Bards College. Please welcome our newest Bard!
We remember all those Solitude soldiers out fighting the good fight in this thankless war.
The festival would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our latest applicant.
The festival would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our most recent inductee.
Welcome, people of Solitude! We of the Bards College are pleased to be here to celebrate the Burning of King Olaf.
By the gods...
Everyone, inside. Now!
By the Nine...
Is he responsible for this? The Arch-Mage, dead?
Quickly now, quickly! I'll find Mirabelle and see if we can't put a stop to this!
There's more. Something's happened to Winterhold. It must be whatever Ancano did. You need to get out there and make sure it's safe.
Die, foul orc!
Begone, invader!
Awaken, and perish!
This is your final hour!
I'll send you to Oblivion!
We must end the nightmares!
Feel the Benevolence of Mara!
You'll pay for your blasphemy!
How dare you defile this temple, orc!
Disappointing.
Do dogs count?
Of course they don't count!
When was your first meal, Banning?
That must have been quite a surprise.
Either way, I came back with meat for the table.
My friend Marex. We were hunting, and I thought he was an elk.
Do I know you?
Only the foolish or the courageous approach a Jarl without summons...
I remember you... You were at Helgen with us! Come to join the war? Speak with Galmar. He handles the new recruits.
As you can see, I have much that requires my attention. If you're inclined to gab, there are some nice prison guards you may like to meet...
Don't hurt me!
Get away from me!
Keep your distance.
That looks dangerous...
That spell looks dangerous...
Don't come too close with that.
It's wearing a dangerous spell...
That spell looks like it'll hurt.
Please! Keep that magic away from me.
Dear, that spell is making me nervous.
You keep your distance with that magic
Uuh. Would you mind dousing that magic?
Do be careful with that spell, will you?
Hurt anyone with that spell and you'll be sorry.
Please stay away while you got that spell on you.
That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.
I trust you know what you're doing with that spell?
You should be more careful with your spell casting.
You really should be more careful with the spells you cast.
This one thinks you should be more careful with your spells.
Walking around like that is why magic gets a bad name. Shame on you.
You better be careful with that magic, if you know what's good for you.
You're asking for trouble walking around with dangerous magic like that.
Fent ni filok.
Hin laas los dii.
By all the gods...
Alduin mah nol thur.
Het siiv nunon dinok.
Alduin sizaan midroti.
Farengar! Enough, fool!
Skuldafn fen kos dinok.
Sosaal fah hin vothaarn.
Boziik, Dovahkiin. Nuz mey.
Get ready to open the trap!
Amativ! Mu bo kotin stinselok.
Alduin saraan hin sil ko Sovngarde!
Faas nu, zini dein ruthi ahst vaal.
Farengar, very bad idea. Even for you.
Father won't let me go see the dragon.
Zu'u uth nall thurri dein daar miiraak.
Joor mey! What are you doing back there?
This seems like a really bad idea to me.
