And come back with a barrel full of gold, hmm?
Hmph. All right, then. Go. Go, my Listener. Find out what that slimy bastard Motierre has to say, then send the Emperor to Sithis.
Ah, but when you're done, there's no use returning here, is there? I was thinking... the Dawnstar Sanctuary. We could make a proper home there.
Listen, when you're finished with this Emperor business, meet Babette and me there. I'll find some way to move the Night Mother. Don't worry. Now go!
Are you completely insane? Swallow a soul gem?
Now all I need... wait, what were we talking about?
That has to be the most brilliant and unexpected solution I've heard in a long time. It solves all of my problems and keeps the field stable!
Aren't the Greybeards expecting some supplies?
On your way up the 7,000 Steps again, Klimmek?
Honestly, I'm not certain. I've yet to be allowed into the monastery. Perhaps one day.
Not today. I'm just not ready to make the climb to High Hrothgar. The path isn't safe.
Be careful. This man is known to be dangerous.
Be careful. This woman is known to be dangerous.
Blackreach... why does that sound so familiar?
It's been... years I think, but perhaps you could still find him.
Of course! It's where my mentor, Sinderion said he was going to do his field research.
But... But you're not going to kill me. Right?
Okay, well... I guess it's possible. I've been selling my sword arm for years now. Killed a lot of people. Could be someone wanted revenge.
By the Eight! You actually talked her into it?
Oh. Well, thanks for trying I suppose. I'll just have to come up with the coin somehow.
I don't know what to say. I didn't think anyone in Riften even cared what happened to me.
Look, I was saving this, but I wanted you to have it. I thought I might need it if Sapphire came for me, but I don't need it anymore.
Can you do it? Can you devour a dragon's soul?
Do you miss your days training at the College?
Absolutely not. I prefer to be near enough to come visit but free to come and go as I please.
Either that or go see the Jarl's court wizard.
I don't even like our Jarl havin' a  court wizard.
Wish the Jarl's wizard would up and leave with ya.
Better that than dealing with Ulfric's wizard like some do.
Otherwise you can try the Jarl's wizard. I wouldn't, though.
Otherwise you could talk to the Jarl's pet wizard in Solitude.
You'd never think to learn from a Nord like the Jarl's wizard.
Winterhold. You want the College there. They teach quite a bit.
Hey! I know. The Jarl's wizard could teach ya. He's lots closer.
Although our Jarl's humble wizard might be willing to help you too.
Else you could go see the Jarl's wizard. Might be able to help you.
If you wanna be a damn fool, go to the College in Winterhold instead.
The Jarl's court wizard was taught there. That one's full of secrets.
That's right. College of Winterhold, just north of town. Hard to miss.
Be a lot safer just to have the Jarl's wizard teach you a thing or two.
Although Ulfric's court wizard has been known to take on apprentices once in a while.
Of course there is Farengar. He might be the Jarl's wizard, but at least he's a Nord.
The College of Winterhold is the only place in Skyrim open-minded enough to teach magic.
Magic? Got no good use for that here. Mages keep to their College in Winterhold. Go bother them.
Head north to Winterhold. There's a College there, they teach magic. Most Nords don't care for them.
Magic? You're on the wrong side of Skyrim. You want Winterhold... that College there. They teach it.
I have no time or patience for a student. Perhaps the College of Winterhold will grant you admission.
Magic is for the weak. Elves, I mean. They keep to that College in Winterhold. They know their place.
Not here. Definitely not here. You want to learn, join the College in Winterhold. They'll deal with it.
Pfft, I should've guessed as much. Your kind sticks to that College in Winterhold, as well they should.
Magic? Goodness, not here! Nothing dangerous like that! That's all kept to that College up in Winterhold.
Nords don't care much for magic. The College in Winterhold is about the only place it's not looked down on.
Magic? That's dangerous. You want to learn that, go to that College in Winterhold. They teach that stuff there.
Seen enough magic in my day to know to stay away from it. I'd stay away from the Jarl's wizard in Dawnstar too.
That'd be the College in Winterhold. I suppose you'll be headed there, then. Well, don't let me get in your way.
Any aspiring mage would do well to look for the College in Winterhold. Head there, and you'll get what you're after.
There's a College in Winterhold that teaches magic. It's very secretive, though, and you know how people hate secrets.
You lookin' for Falion? Why don't you go bother those mages at their College in Winterhold and leave my brother alone?
I've got no interest in magic users. No use for their kind at all. They're way up north in Winterhold, and that's fine with me.
Magic is... frowned upon in Skyrim. Only the mages at the College of Winterhold teach it freely. If you wish to learn, join them.
The people of Skyrim don't like magic much, so about the only place you're likely to find a teacher is the College of Winterhold.
Bit of advice, folks here don't care for magic or those that use it. If you're intent on it, check at the College up in Winterhold.
A prospective student, are you? Well, I'm afraid I'm not much good at teaching. You should try your luck at the College of Winterhold.
Looking to blow yourself up? I hear that's what magic does to you. There's a College in Winterhold that teaches magic, unless that blew up too.
Magic is nothing but trouble. If you're set on it, there's that College in Winterhold or Ulfric's court wizard. But don't say I didn't warn you.
Oh, I think you'll find that magic is rare in Skyrim. Winterhold, though... The College there has it in abundance. Look there if you wish to learn.
Farewell. Eyes open and walk with the shadows.
From her reverie, we know the mind of our god.
The Sybil of Dibella spends her entire life in direct communion with the goddess.
From the time she's a little girl to the moment she expires, she is a direct connection with the heavenly mother.
We have had a vision of the next Sybil, living in a village to the north. She must be brought to the temple for her reverie to begin.
Good. Make sure not one of them escapes alive.
Good. Report back to me when your task is complete.
Good. We'll be waiting for you at the stables.
It will be good to finally be able to return home.
Great, with the two of us this should be easy.
Has the Thieves Guild visited you yet, Haelga?
They haven't been by the Bunkhouse, but I'm certain they will. How about you?
Perhaps they moved on to greener pastures. Whatever the reason, lets be glad they're scarce.
No. I'm surprised actually. I thought they had a stranglehold on the city, but in the last few years, it hasn't been that bad.
Hasn't Mercer Frey taught you people anything?
You kill me and your only contact with the East Empire Company vanishes. That's not smart for business.
Here, take this as a small token of my esteem.
There is another thing you could do for me. Suitable for someone of your particular talents, perhaps.
Come, let's go find Farengar, my court wizard. He's been looking into a matter related to these dragons and... rumors of dragons.
His perception may be more coherent than ours.
I fear I have already overstepped the bounds of my Order, but I will offer this: seek out the Augur of Dunlain here in your College.
Huh. Okay. We'll test your mettle another day.
Then your poverty is my reward. Kill or be killed!
Typical outlander weakling. But your gold will strengthen our clan.
I cannot thank you enough for all of the help.
I don't expect you to be capable of even that.
I don't think that could have gone any better.
Anything else you need before you head back to Riften?
I get them fresh from the farms daily, Nazeem.
These fruits and vegetables are disappointing, Carlotta.
If you were getting them from my farm, they'd be twice as fresh.
I say you've earned an early pardon. Let's go.
I'm afraid I don't see the connection, though.
I don't know. If the Augur suggested it, there must be a good reason for locating it.
I'm busy, and you're bothering me. So go away.
I'm really not in the mood. State your business, or take your leave.
I'm sorry, Betrid. I'll clean them right away.
Rhiada, did you clean the tables today? They're filthy!
The temple, Betrid? You were one of Dibella's faithful?
I misspoke. Never mind what I said. Now get back to work.
I'm sorry, Betrid. I thought I had cleaned the tables properly.
No, don't bother. You're useless, as always. I'll get Ildene to do it.
Oh, stop apologizing. It makes you look like an idiot. Learn to talk back a bit, girl! Why, when I was in the temple....
If anyone should be thanked, it should be you.
There's no need to thank me. What you did was for the people of Dawnstar.
If you find that sword, please bring it to me.
Windhelm has been hard on my people. But our fortunes will turn, and we have shelter and food.
It was supposed to be an honor, but very well.
It's been two months, and no word from father.
Might be worth riding out to Solitude, see if a messenger ship's come in.
Don't worry, brother. I'm sure he's fine. We've waited longer before receiving a letter.
If it'll put your mind at ease, then I agree. But not now, all right? We need the business from the stand.
Let's get down there. We have to do something.
Well, I suppose we can't just stand here. We'd better do something.
That's certainly an understatement. I've never seen anything like this!
It 'may be' in danger? Take a look. I don't think there's much question.
May the light of certitude guide your efforts.
Mercer's been here, I hope we aren't too late.
Move on, friend. I have nothing to sell today.
Much appreciated, Lady Drifa, but I'll manage.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm certain Bolli would be happy to lend you a few septims.
We got a few pieces of jewelry at the Prawn, Madesi. Want to come take a look at them later?
I wish I could, milady. Sadly, I haven't sold enough of my own jewelry let alone buy some from you. I'm sorry.
No, I think I have enough here to get started.
Here, let me give you this. It's the least I can do for all your trouble.
Not now! It's time to get back at these crows.
Of course, I have a small favor to ask of you.
I'm not sure I'm the best one to go through his things.
There's another piece, that Kodlak always kept close to himself. Would you go to his chambers and bring it back for me?
Ooh... This place really chills the blood, eh?
Ha, I knew you'd join up! Great news. We'll take back Skyrim together, eh?
I remember you... you were with us at Helgen. I heard you joined us. Welcome to the Stormcloaks!
I'm glad I'll have you beside me in there. This place chills my blood, and I don't care who knows it.
Perhaps you begin to see the world as a dovah.
Perhaps now you have some insight into the forces that shape the vennesetiid... the currents of Time.
Please do let me know if you change your mind.
Ah, well now you can help me directly! Far more useful, I think.
Please, let me know if it seems safe to leave.
Secret? What makes you think there's a secret?
There are no secrets here, my curious friend. Our prosperity is simply the result of hard work, good fortune and the blessings of the gods.
See you, friend. And take it easy on the wine.
Seems we're all branded villains these days...
I'm always looking for able fighters. Not everyone can say they made it out of Helgen.
So long as your criminal past stays in the past, and you fight for me with honor and integrity, we'll welcome you into our ranks.
So the stories are true... you are Dragonborn!
I think there is much that we can learn from each other.
Normally you'd need to show some aptitude with one of the schools of magic, but you...
Someone has to stand up to them. I won't sell.
You're right. They always get what they want, somehow. Fine. Tell Atar I'll sell.
Someone who doesn't like you asking questions.
Sooner or later, we all have to choose a side.
Thank you. I'll be sure to put it to good use.
If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
Excellent. I think you'll be glad that you made this decision.
That may be what you are here for, Dragonborn.
But again, we see that the natural order will be restored, one way or another.
But stopping Alduin is one thing. Helping you wipe out dragons again is quite another.
Perhaps we would have dragon allies against Alduin if the ancient Blades had not acted so arrogantly.
Dragons are part of the natural order of the world. The Blades thought to change the order to suit themselves, by wiping out the dragons.
That's privileged information. Now move along.
The eyes of the law are everywhere these days.
You have piqued my curiosity, however. Please, do continue.
One should never pay too much attention to rumors, Torbjorn.
It's a bad time to be a criminal, what with these murders going on.
The guards are looking for a killer, but who knows what else they might turn up? Good day.
I've been meaning to speak to you, Niranye. Rumor is, you've got ties to the Thieves' Guild.
In fact, thieves have been known to kill, if there's a profit in it. This war's been hard on all of us.
Not that I'd know anything about it, of course, but it seems to me that the last thing a thieves' guild would want is to draw attention to itself.
The prey is strong. Stronger than the hunters.
But more will come. Bring him down, for the glories of Lord Hircine.
The question is, what isn't wrong with Riften.
This city is corrupt. Rotten to the core. No one cares about anything except themselves and how much coin they can make off the misery of others.
We have a bit of a sensitive matter this time.
Just in time. I was worried I'd have to do this myself.
A wealthy family has... misplaced one of their heirlooms.
Some rich folk had a trinket stolen and they want us to get it back.
We need to move faster. Keep them off balance.
Calm yourself, Galmar. Save it for the battlefield.
Our men are getting massacred out there. Damn Imperials.
We can't march on Solitude. Not yet. One thing at a time.
It's working, Galmar. Our patience has won us friends and allies. And our armies are systematically taking care of the rest.
We're at war, old fool, or have you forgotten?
As you command, my lord. But, the issue could be solved another way.
Forgive me, my lord. It was foolish of me to make such a suggestion.
If we spend less on new arms and armor for the guards, for example...
My lord Jarl, if we do not take steps soon, our coffers will be empty.
Whiterun is the crown jewel of Skyrim, and you would leave us defenseless?
Raise the taxes, then! Put anyone that refuses to pay in the stocks and make an example of them.
Well done. You have now passed all the trials.
Come inside. The other masters will meet us there.
Ah! You've retrieved the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller.
Come with me. It is time for us to recognize you formally as Dragonborn.
First, Master Wulfgar will teach you the final word of Unrelenting Force. You are ready.
Stand in the center of the room and prepare yourself to taste the Voice of the Greybeards.
Well, are there any questions before we begin?
Well, it all worked out in the end, didn't it?
Well, that depends on what you're looking for.
What a fascinating conversation that would be!
Sadly, no. My work affords me few opportunities for such an adventure.
Perhaps some hero will bring one to Dragonsreach, like old Olaf One-Eye once did.
Why are the potions I requested not completed?
Yes, milady. Sorry, milday. They will be completed.
Excuses are not acceptable in my court. When I ask for something I expect results, and I expect them immediately.
I'm sorry, milady. The components for those elixirs are quite volatile and in some cases, very dangerous to handle. I must take care.
Why don't you take your coin and keep walking?
Divines know the mill could use some new blades. All right. It's yours. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.
Wonderful! My lady Mara will be quite pleased!
Yes, I think I'd enjoy a woman like your wife.
Well then, it's too bad my wife is already taken.
One of these days, we'll have to find you a good woman like my Olda.
Yes, it's a great shame. Gods willing, I'll find someone just like her one day.
Yes, of course. I said I'd tell you, didn't I?
Although not interested enough to keep me from being locked up.
The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes.
The... the books? Oh, I see. I thought perhaps... Well, I thought you'd come for me.
But yes, the books. The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes.
You have asked for my help. I am providing it.
The degeneracy of the Empire is on display here in this room.
At least Ulfric's men are willing to fight for their principles, barbaric as they may be.
It's a necessary part of my job to mix with the upper classes of Skyrim, such as they are.
It's only a matter of time before your whole rotten Empire collapses of its own decay. No offense.
None of these people cares a whit about the religious aspects of this war. Another sign of the degeneracy of your Empire.
You heading up to High Hrothgar soon, Klimmek?
I wish I didn't have to. It's quite a difficult climb.
Take your time then. It isn't as though the Greybeards are going to complain.
I know, but I don't want to let them down. I guess I better start thinking about it soon.
You're a natural. Never seen anythin' like it.
Bein' a thief is like a second skin for you, ain't it? Never seen anythin' like it.
If you don't watch out, you might even earn Vex's respect. Now that'd be something, eh?
Success means that the Guild is gettin' stronger. We've picked up another merchant and a new recruit.
We've got a long way to go, but don't let that bother you... it's a lot farther than we've been in years.
I'm goin' to tell you'll somethin' you'll never hear me say again, and if you tell anyone I told you, I'll deny it.
It's nice to shake the cobwebs off and get things rollin' again. Keep this up and I can see a bounty headed our way.
We're still growin' by leaps and bounds thanks to you. Another merchant's just moved into the space outside the Flagon.
When you walk through the Guild, don't be ashamed to hold your head high 'cause you're the best damn thief in the place.
I think you'll find that the Guild is beginnin' to grow. We've had a merchant move into the space right outside the Flagon.
The Guild's at full strength and we have you to thank for it. We've had our share of dark times, and now they seem like a distant memory.
You're an animal, Tythis... keep away from me.
Ah, so my reputation as a lover precedes me. Care to reconsider?
Hey, Svana... I hear you like Dark Elves. Perhaps I could should you what a real Dark Elf can do to you.
You're disgusting! Don't you even think of laying a finger on me or I'll cut off something you can't live without.
... and may we one day rejoin them in eternity.
The god Arkay was once like us, bound to winding mortality.
It is through the ebb and flow of this cosmic tide that we find renewal and, in the end, peace.
But he willingly gave up this existence that we might better understand the vagaries of life and death.
May the spirit of Lavinia and all those who have left this world and its suffering know the beloved serenity of Aetherius...
A dragon? In Helgen? It can't be... although...
It would explain what I saw earlier... flying down the valley from the south... I thought I must have just been seeing things...
A little late in the day for your rounds Sorex.
I seem to have more chores for the Winking Skeever each day. I still have a delivery to do too.
A Nightingale? Oh, I had no idea. My apologies.
Actually, I'm growing it if you hadn't noticed.
I'm the only person alive that can cultivate nirnroot from a seed to a fully grown plant.
Ah. Thank you! Excellent. Now... where were we?
An arrangement? After you've destroyed so much?
I'm afraid you don't have anything worth trading.
Fine. Leave me the elf. You may go with your books.
Now, you can go back to your College and leave me be, or I can kill you. Your choice.
An outsider, eh? Never heard of the Companions?
An order of warriors. We are brothers and sisters in honor.
And we show up to solve problems if the coin is good enough.
And you don't want to talk to Borkul the Beast.
No one talks to Madanach, I'm afraid. Not without getting past Borkul the Beast.
If you're asking, that means you're the new lifer. Tough luck, friend. Those guards sold you out but good.
Are you making good progress with the planting?
So far, things are going well. Let's just hope the weather holds.
Aye, to your husband. Divines bless his memory.
Now, who was it that kidnapped the Jarl's son 20 years ago?
Those were the days. I'd never seen my husband fight so bravely before.
You mean Hildolf the Skull-Splitter? Remember when we rounded up the townspeople and dragged him out of that cave?
But you won't get any better than this from me.
If you're looking for truth instead, see Noster. He's a good example of what life has to offer.
And if you're just looking to feel good, go get some Spiced Wine from Evette. But whatever you do, just leave me alone.
Certainly! It's a fine tune and a good request!
Did you reconsider? Will you talk to my father?
Don't know what you're talking about, stranger.
Don't like it? Too bad. This is our city. Ours!
A hundred septims says I can take ya, bare-handed.
A hundred gold says I knock your hide to the ground.
I'm drunk, and it's been a while since I had a good fight.
And why not? I could beat anyone in this city, bare-handed.
Want me to prove it? I bet a hundred gold I can take you, bare-handed.
How about a test? Your muscle against mine. The victor gains 100 gold coins from the loser.
Don't think I can take you? One hundred septims says I can punch you back where you came from.
Either way this ends up, I'm headed to the inn.
My wife's going to kill me when I tell her we'll need to bring another cow.
Embrace order and hard truth, mortal. Good bye.
Fine, I'll get someone else to take care of it.
Good luck with the giant. Don't get stepped on.
Good, good. Does it say where he may be headed?
Have you gotten the items I requested from you?
You assured me that you could find it, however.
I did, and I will. It's just tougher than I thought.
Not yet. You know you're asking for some pretty strange stuff, don't you? It's not easy to find.
Here you go. Try not to spill anything on them.
The crucial nature is pure apparent. Mundane sight traded for another sort.
What is this... it's... it's just a book?! I can see. The world beyond burns in my mind. It's marvelous....
Hey, you. Get over here, I want to talk to you.
Hm. Yes, perhaps. A certain strength of spirit.
Would you now? Here, let me have a look at you.
I don't have a clue. That door is impenetrable.
Without two keys, it's impossible to open. I have a key, Delvin has a key, and Mercer has a key. That's it. There are no other copies.
I got the message. Consider it forgotten, boss.
I want no mercy for those Forsworn. Understand?
I... I'm sorry. I could have sworn I sealed it.
Ungrien! I just found another spoiled keg! What's the matter with you?
Tell me something. Do you enjoy spending Lady Maven's gold for her? It certainly seems that way.
This is the last warning. You do it again, and you'll be sleeping in Beggar's Row with the rest of the riff-raff!
I'd still keep an eye on my purse if I was you.
If that's true, then we have much more to fear than the Thieves Guild.
You've heard too? They say the town was completely destroyed by a dragon.
So while I was in Ivarstead, I heard news that something terrible happened at Helgen.
I'll tell you more about it when we are nearby.
It's somewhere around here, Agna said to look to the Bear to find the way.
I'm sorry, Ghorza. I just... flinch, and uh....
You strike your metal like a new mother giving her babe a light slap. Hit it harder.
If you can't pound the dusk out of your iron, it'll break when it's finished. Hit. It. Harder.
I've been looking for a way to appease Hircine.
There is a certain beast in these lands. Large, majestic.
I want to beg his forgiveness. Give him back the ring. But while I'm stuck in here, the beast wanders free.
It's said that Hircine will commune with whoever slays it. I tracked it into these woods, but then had my... accident with the child.
It is within you to succeed. Never forget that.
Now, I am afraid I must leave you. We will continue to watch over you, and guide you as best we can.
Kleppr, you idiot! Can't you do anything right?
What? What did I do this time? I was just standing here!
Shouldn't you be helping me then, wife of mine? Sharing my problems? Being my better half?
You were just standing there when you were supposed to be serving drinks to our customers!
I am your better half. And your better half is telling you to stop being an idiot and serve the customers their drinks!
Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can.
My dear, I am merely observing the proceedings.
I've had yet another complaint. Please stop barging in on experiments in progress.
Well then [QUOTE]observe[QUOTE] from a greater distance. You're making people uncomfortable.
No, I think I've got this one. Thanks, though.
If you really want to do my job for me... Here, I'll mark the location on your map.
No. I'm telling you. There was no other reason.
Not Lady Dibella? No, please! I can't lose her!
I get the message. Here, take your gold. I hope you choke on it!
Now, on to the business at hand I suppose, hmm?
Oh, good. She'll listen to you, I just know it.
Oh, it's you. I didn't expect to see you again.
Oh. Well, if you change your mind, let me know.
Our families been close as kin for generations.
They're sayin' dragons have returned to Skyrim. Now that there, that's a real problem.
Aye, that I do. Have all my life. We Battle-Borns have been here since the beginning. Along with the Gray-Manes.
But Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising has divided us. Now seems we can scarce look at each other without comin' to blows. Petty and foolish, that.
Return the gloves to me when you have finished.
Go to each focal point and remove whatever impurities you may find there.
Please exercise caution. This is not a procedure without possible... consequences.
Very well. These specially enchanted gloves will allow you to delve directly into the focal points for these energies.
Sadly, I have yet to see it function in person.
I assure you, the Dreamstride is well known in Vaerminian Lore.
Tell me, Ragnar, what do you think of the Orcs?
I asked what you thought of the Orcs, not about me.
Oh. I'm sorry. Well, it's good to have you here, anyway.
Cunning warriors and skilled workers. It's good to have you here, Lash.
That armor you got rid of. I can have it, yeah?
Hey. That armor. You got rid of it, yeah? I can take it, no problem?
If you're not going use that armor you dropped... do you mind if I take it?
Pardon. I saw you toss a piece of armor. You wouldn't mind if I take it, then?
Beg pardon. You dropped some armor over there. Don't suppose you'd mind if I... took it?
Umm... You dropped a piece armor over there. I was kind of hoping that I could, you know, have it?
Excuse me. I'm assuming that armor you got rid of wasn't an accident, but just in case, I wanted to make sure I could take it.
Couldn't help but notice, that, um... you dropped some armor. Just wanted to check with you before I took it. Is that all right?
That'd be Vald. A real piece of work, that one.
Mercer's holding something over his head, keeping him loyal.
Talk to Vex. She used to know him very well... if you catch my meaning.
That's a touching story. Now get outta my face.
A friend, huh? Well... then it's probably okay if I tell you.
Maybe I'm just getting soft in my old age, but I actually believe you.
I guess you don't hear too well. I never heard of this [QUOTE]friend[QUOTE] of yours.
That's definitely going in my part of the Edda.
Sorry, I need to pay attention so I can remember this.
The Great Collapse, as it has come to be known.
I've seen documents dating back to the late Second Era. Beyond that, it's hard to say.
Events in the last several hundred years resulted in a significant loss of our history, I'm afraid.
I know there are some who have blamed the College, said that we were responsible. I assure you this is not the case.
No one is sure of the cause. Some believed the eruption of Red Mountain had far-reaching consequences that were only felt years later.
An unfortunate natural disaster that ravaged the area. The College fared far better than the city of Winterhold, but it was not left untouched.
The Ratway's too good of a place for that scum.
I'd hardly call them a Guild. More like unorganized rabble.
How appropriate they should live in the Ratway with the rest of the trash.
They'd stop at nothing to take your last bit of food if that's all you had.
Stormcloaks won't have it though. Too busy keeping the Imperial forces at bay.
All it would take is a small force of guard to go into the Ratway and flush them out.
All I need is a dozen men and we could march into the Ratway and burn them out like rodents.
They're vermin... garbage. They're exactly what makes this city such a horrible place to live.
Now, they're nothing more than ruffians and thugs trying to pry a few extra coin from honest people.
Liars and bastards. Every one of them. I'd have their heads on a pike if it wasn't for the war effort.
As one of our city's most influential citizens, she's has taken it upon herself to oversee their incarceration.
They used to be pretty feared around here. I mean, you'd whisper the name and it'd send chills down your spine.
In fact, I wouldn't say they were a threat at all. No, our resources should be spent on preparations for invasion.
Sadly, they're proving elusive but I have confidence that Maven won't give up until this city has been rid of them all.
They make it difficult for decent people to earn a living. Of course, not many decent people live here in the first place.
We're all eager to see them brought to justice. Maven Black-Briar has assured me that they're being dealt with appropriately.
They live below the streets in the Ratway like dirty animals. And trust me, they're no better than the vermin that slink out of there for scraps.
There you are. I had wondered where you got to.
Do you think you could handle Vilkas in a real fight?
There's no reasoning with these people anymore.
Just one more thing the Gray-Manes want to blame on others.
And yet they want to heap the fault on my family's good name? Bah.
It's not my fault they turned their backs on the Empire, or their mule of a son raised arms against it.
More bad blood between the houses. Fralia is convinced our family is somehow at fault for the loss of her son.
This is Nocturnal's way of maintaining balance.
Be warned that once you've chosen, you can't reselect for at least a day.
If you ever feel the need to change your abilities, you can return to the Sepulcher and step onto a different circle.
Time is of the essence here, please hurry back.
Unslaad krosis. Innumerable pardons. I digress.
His door to Sovngarde is at Skuldafn, one of his ancient fanes high in the eastern mountains.
Zu'u lost ofan hin laan... now that I have answered your question, you will allow me to go free?
Mindoraan, pah ok middovahhe lahvraan til. I surely do not need to warn you that all his remaining strength is marshalled there.
He has travelled to Sovngarde to regain his strength, devouring the sillesejoor... the souls of the mortal dead. A privilege he jealously guards...
Wait here. I'll be right back with your reward.
Wait. Wait. Don't kill me. There's another way.
I can take the pieces back to my museum. Seal them in a display case.
You get a generous amount of gold, I get to complete my collection, and nobody has to die.
We should get moving. There's no time to waste.
Good. Good. Now we won't have to spend time searching for it.
We're all trying to become better mages, right?
I still need someone to practice a few spells on. Interested?
Well, I need someone I can practice a few spells on. Nothing dangerous, really. Would you be willing to assist me?
Well met, kinsman. What brings you to Whiterun?
Well met, traveler. What brings you to Whiterun?
Well, I'll take it under advisement. Thank you.
Oh, no. I hadn't heard from Gorm for a while, so I'd hoped he'd given up on his little scheme.
The last time we'd discussed this issue was before this damnable war broke out. Things were different then.
Now, what's he's asking, it's just impossible. Even if it worked, the questions and accusations it would cause...
Well, I'm getting to that. Just let me explain.
What? Filthy assassin! We'll see who lies dead!
What? Well, we'll see about that now, won't we?
When are those Silver-Blood men going to leave?
Never. They've shut us down forever, Enmon. The Divines have abandoned us.
Why? Because it's old, and full of dead things?
Clearly you've never spent any time in Morrowind.
Wow. You've really done it. The staff is yours.
Yes, and I'm more than happy to give it to you.
Here you go... should fit you like a glove... boss.
I mean look at this place. I've never seen so much wealth down here. You've made us all rich.
Yes, old friend, I'm afraid it's not good news.
Styrr says she's still in spirit form or we'd all be dead already.
When you broke up the binding Potema escaped. We've encountered some of her minions.
You've already done us a service in stopping the binding, but I need you to go talk to him, to see if Styrr can tell us what to do next.
You can't threaten me any worse than they have!
You help my people, and I'll make you my Thane.
However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold.
You help my people and purchase a house from my steward, and I'll make you my Thane.
There is room in my court for a new Thane. It's an honorary title, mainly, but there are a few perks someone like you could make use of.
However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold, and who owns at least one piece of property in my city.
You ready for some good old-fashioned burglary?
The catch is you can't kill anyone who lives there or you forfeit the payment.
Sure, sure. We're always looking to get our hands on items from all over Skyrim. How about this one?
Pretty simple. Break into a house, grab a specific item and get out before they realize what's going on.
Have a house with a good bit of valuables inside, but one particular item's caught my eye. You up for it?
Got a tip on a desirable item at this location. We want you to break in there and bring it to us. What do you think?
Good, got a buyer in a rush for this item. If you hurry we can turn it around and make a quick profit. Can you get it?
We've actually stolen this item before and somehow it ended up back in some other mark's house. Guess it's time to reclaim it, eh?
We've been trying to get this item for a while, but no one with the skills has come along to claim it. Can I count on you to get it?
As long as you can keep things quiet and don't get yourself killed in the process, this place has exactly what we're looking for. You in?
We're looking to recover an heirloom for a client. They claim ownership of it, and as long as they're paying we don't really care. You in?
You've done this city a mighty service, friend.
I believe you'll find the guards to be a bit more cordial with you in the future.
[QUOTE]Eyes on the prey, not the horizon.[QUOTE]
Oh, no. Only the Circle have the beastblood. Prove your honor to be a Companion.
No, only members of the Circle get this blessing. Right now we're just seeing if you're worth keeping around.
A blade! It will be as sharp as Fralia's tongue!
Ah, is there any weapon finer than an Orc blade?
No, mother. It's no wonder our enemies fear the sight of an Orc warrior.
Ahhh, a fine but bloody tale. I can do that one.
All right. I don't want any trouble. It's yours.
Are you serious? I hear more threatening words from my wife.
Are you serious? I say more threatening words to my husband.
Almost ever since he became leader of the tribe.
He killed Shagrol in combat, which none of us thought possible. But the winner is made Chief. That is how it is done.
And no doubt you're one of them. Leave me alone!
And yet you have done my bidding. Why, I wonder?
Anything you steal, you bring it straight to me.
Now get out of here and don't come back until your pockets are full.
You'd better. Because until you do, you don't get a single coin from us... and you won't be able to use our fences.
Be grateful for what time I give you until then.
Your mockery will be the end of you. And on that day, another servant will feast on your entrails and discover a ring clenched in her teeth.
But the deepest, keenest hatred was for himself.
Don't get too comfortable here, mortal. You may actually earn your way out.
Wonderfully done. Pelagius is finally ready to love himself... and continue hating everyone else.
Ah, now this is a sad path. Pelagius hated and feared many things. Assassins, wild dogs, the undead, pumpernickel...
The attacks he makes on himself can be seen here fully. They are always carried out on the weakest part of his fragile self.
You seem to be having a small problem... or perhaps it's a big problem? Maybe if you shrunk the whole thing down a little first?
The self-loathing enhances Pelagius' anger! Ah, but his confidence will shrink with every hit. You must bring the two into balance.
By Sithis, what a mess. I guess this is the end.
You just worry about fulfilling the contract. I'll take care of things on this end.
By the gods, he's just a retired ship's captain.
Maybe to you, but he's just so... his story is...
So have you ever actually spoken to Captain Lonely-Gale?
He's just a guard captain. And not a very good one, at that.
Did you see that candle above the fire upstairs?
When word came that he'd fallen, his son Deroct lit the candle in his honor. Nobody knows why it still burns.
It was lit one hundred and sixty-three years ago, back when this building was the home of a grand warrior named Vundheim.
Drafted into a war, how could my life get worse?
We're at war with Leigelf? Isn't he your husband?
No he isn't! He's the enemy, and we are going to crush him.
Keep at it. We need to work twice as hard now that fat-headed Leigelf has declared war!
Gods, you are curious. Almost... dangerously so.
When he became Jarl, I insisted on serving as his protector. He had no cause to argue.
Balgruuf and I share a battle bond. We met as youths, and forged our friendship in the fires of war.
Gone? Every one of them? Why, that's incredible.
Ha! Spoken like the leader of the Thieves Guild.
Just don't lose yourself in the role. We have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation.
Hahaha! You have much to learn of the dov, then.
There is no distinction between debate and combat to a dragon. Tinvaak los grah. For us it is one and the same.
There is nothing else but philosophy to a dovah. It is no accident that we do battle with our Thu'um, our Voices.
Have faith, mortal. I will be watching over you.
He has some simple-minded courier delivering it?
Here, take these. Looks like you're running low.
Here, ya' did me a favor, I guess I owe you one.
I can't believe it! How did ya' talk her into this?
You try and set one foot in this yard, and I'll cut it off.
Never mind, I don't care. I'm just glad I don't gotta' work for Maven anymore.
You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away unless ya' can talk Maven Black-Briar into letting me outta' my debt.
I am Master Arngeir. I speak for the Greybeards.
Now tell me, Dragonborn, why have you come here?
Shout for us, Dragonborn. Then we may have time for questions.
I cannot go into battle without a sword, Hjalti.
I don't have to take this from the likes of you.
I don't want to choose! They're both so amazing.
I have to get to Markarth at once. Cut me loose.
The Dark Mistress? She sent you? Wait. Molag Bal's altar. Of course.
The Dark Mistress? Sent you? Ha. Now tell me the one about the Troll who gives gifts to good little boys and girls.
I seem to have misplaced the book I was reading.
If you happen to see it, would you mind bringing it to me?
I can't find my Alembic. I suppose I could use another one, but... well, it sounds silly, but mine has sentimental value.
I think the Thalmor are trying to steal my work!
He's asked far, far too many questions about my research.
I haven't told him anything, of course. What I'm doing is far too important. Can't breathe a word of it.
I thought I was clear when I said I didn't know.
Endon's mold? I'm afraid you have the wrong place, my friend. You'll find no silversmiths here.
I assure you, I have nothing of value. I'm nothing but a poor woodcutter just trying to make ends meet.
I told you, I don't know anything else about it.
I told you, I know everything about this castle.
How you get it from them is up to you. Nobody would notice if Farengar went missing, I promise you.
For some reason that door is special. Only two people can open it, Balgruuf and Farengar, the court wizard.
I'm doing as you asked. Not for nothing, I hope?
I don't recall seeing you at one of these before. And I know everyone who's anyone in Skyrim.
See that disgusting drunk over there? A high-ranking official in the East Empire Company, believe it or not.
That's General Tullius himself. He can't stand Elenwen, but she insists that he attend these parties. Just to piss him off, no doubt.
If you find any more candidates bring them here.
I can handle training one more. After that, I think we'll be ready for a little dragon hunting of our own.
That's enough recruits for now. Ask Esbern about the dragon lairs he's been studying. We'll have the recruits do some hunting with you.
Ignoring me, huh? Suit yourself. Get 'em Hewnon!
Indeed. I... I thought you captured the Butcher.
You said the city was safe, now. How could this have happened?
Is that so? And what were you thinking, exactly?
The interrogations are quite merciless, from what I've heard.
Hello, Jora. I'm glad to see you. In fact, I was just thinking about you and your husband.
We accept the risks that come with our faith, but I'll keep your offer in mind. Thank you, Niranye.
I fear for you and your husband, should the Thamlor come here. But perhaps there's a way I can help.
Well, let's just say that I know some people who are experts at helping others disappear when they need to.
I doubt Ulfric would let Thalmor into Windhelm without a fight. But please, do continue. How would you help us?
Well, I've heard awful stories about these Thalmor, and how they're rounding up everyone who still worships Talos.
They are discreet and thorough, though not inexpensive. I hope you'll keep that in mind, should the worst come to pass.
Is that so? We shall see, villain. We shall see!
It's good that you brought this to my attention.
Ah, so it is not just dreams then. I have seen this.
I will see that it is dealt with. Thank you for bringing clarity.
Is that so? Well, I'll make sure that's taken care of immediately.
It's held in a Hagraven nest called Orphan Rock.
Your spirit is strong. Kynareth's winds will guide your path.
It's only because I've had an excellent teacher.
Sometimes I'm not certain that the people of Riften want to be helped.
Aerin, you never cease to amaze me. You always see the good in everything.
I think some of them do, Lady Mjoll. They're just too frightened to step up and do something about it like you are.
Kodlak was right. I let vengeance rule my heart.
I regret nothing of what we did at Driftshade. But I can't go any further with my mind fogged or my heart grieved.
Make them all pay for what they've done to me...
Isn't there some business you should be tending to?
I didn't know it when we were... with each other... but Alain is actually the leader of a band of cutthroats. Bandits.
They're holed up in some old dwarven ruin - Raldbthar. It's near Windhelm. They use it as their base. It's where they stage their raids.
I want you to go to that ruin, find Alain Dufont, and kill him. I don't care about his friends. Do whatever you want with them. But Alain has to die!
My tunic is fading. Too much sun and salt spray.
I doubt it can be repaired. You'll have to buy a new one.
Now, let's pretend we never had this discussion.
It'll be a fairly slow moving caravan. The shipment is quite heavy, and guarded by many men.
They're taking it by wagon to Solitude. If you hurry, you'll catch them before they get far.
They're taking it by wagon to Windhelm. If you hurry, you'll catch them before they get far.
Of course. Just bring it to me when you find it.
Oh, I like that! Very good, very good! Creative!
But killing me would be a mistake! Oh yes. You would displease our mother, hmm? For she's your mother too, isn't she... Listener?
Walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell the pretender Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! One little itty bitty lie!
Oh, my mistake then. Sorry, you can go on ahead.
Sure, and I'm Queen Barenziah. Now tell me another one.
Please, relax. Free your mind. Yes, that's it...
Hmph. Yes. Yes, I surely can. It's not something I do lightly, mind you, and it's not as specific as you might want. But yes. I will do this for you.
Poor mother... Her new home seems so very far...
I will wait for Loreius! Oh yes, mother and I will wait right here, right here until he fixes our wheel.
Agh! Bother and befuddle! Stuck here! Stuck! My mother, my poor mother. Unmoving. At rest, but too still!
Poor mother... she's been waiting here so long... Stupid farmer and his stupid tools! Why won't he help us?
The farmer is at his farm! Where else would he be? Loreius is his name. Talk to him. Convince him to help poor Cicero.
Unfair! Unjust! Cicero has done nothing wrong! Loreius will pay for his treachery! Oh, how he will pay... And you! You were no help! Not at all!
Potema herself? Please tell me you stopped them.
Really? Well, allow me to clarify the situation.
More importantly, I'd like to know why he's asking for you specifically.
So we're going to go have a little chat with him, and find out exactly what it is he wants.
I'd like to know why there's someone claiming to be from the Psijic Order here in the College.
Should they accept her rule, we will have peace.
But we must have the support of the other Jarls for that claim to have any meaning.
Sure you can handle that? Ha! Of course you can.
Thank you, Madena. I appreciate your assistance.
I, well, no of course not. I would be glad to help.
Madena, I was wondering if you could help me with something. Your magic would be invaluable.
If this is about battle magic, forget it. I've told every Jarl I've served under that I won't....
Actually, I was just wondering if you could make sure people are tended to if they get hurt. I'm sure you wouldn't object to that.
Thank you, Runil. Your support means much to us.
Ah, Indara. Arkay's blessing upon you and your husband. Spend as much time here as you need.
That's all they are... rumors. So quit worrying.
Look, I need to know. What's going on between you and Brynjolf?
Hey, hey. Sorry. I just get jealous when I hear rumors about you.
How dare you! After all we've been through together? How can you do this to me!
The Circle are the ones who parcel out the jobs.
Kodlak advises them, but he doesn't really give orders.
That's Aela, Skjor, and the brothers, Farkas and Vilkas.
If you're looking to join up, Kodlak's the one to be talking to.
In charge of what? I'm in charge of me, and you're in charge of you.
You don't just waddle in here and get to speak to the boss. Who do you think you are?
Soon enough, it'll be me. In the meanwhile, the Circle handles our daily routine, and Kodlak advises them as Harbinger.
If you want to embarrass yourself, I won't stop you. Kodlak is the Harbinger. He's the closest thing you'll find to a leader around here.
The door is hidden, but I will show you the way.
I forget that you've never seen it. Beneath the Skyforge, where Eorlund works.
The only unusual thing is the shape of the cuts.
I don't know who in Windhelm would even have something like that. Other than me, of course.
They look like they were made with... well, the ancient Nords used these kinds of curved blades when they embalmed their dead.
They will hunt him while you delay. Your choice.
There are others who would gladly accept my favor.
There is no retribution in the hunt. It is not vengeance I seek, but the blood course of a living hunt.
True enough, you cur. Back to work, I suppose...
Why so glum, my ugly friend? Did we run out of mead?
Can you pay attention to work for once, instead of your mug?
Guess we can't afford to miss that much work, can we? Oh well...
I have to work twice as hard because you drink up all our profits.
Hjorunn, the last time you tried anything, your fist broke on my head!
Just as long as you don't breathe on me, Hjorunn. I'll be out for hours.
Kharag, take a break and drink with me! Those trees aren't going anywhere!
What did you say? I ought to break off one of those tusks and use it as my drinking horn!
Don't make me to defend the honor of my mead! It's been my friend a lot longer than you have!
Truly? So maybe my mother isn't crazy after all.
You had best tell the Jarl in Whiterun. He needs to know about this.
Trust me, we have nothing to say to one another.
Wallow in your wretchedness, my newest champion.
We have to catch up to him before it's too late.
Brynjolf and I found them like that. Mercer's doing.
Well now. What have we here? A lost little lamb?
You really don't want to be loitering here, stranger.
Where did all these pretty red plants come from?
They're beautiful. I can see why he wanted to find them.
Remember Uncle Sinderion? These are the plants he was searching for... the Crimson Nirnroot.
One day, these beautiful plants will make us famous and we can finally move off of this farm... thanks to Sinderion.
Without it, we're just a bunch of petty thieves.
If we want to stay on top in Skyrim, the Guild needs that paragon back.
Yeah, but Twice-Killed has more of a ring to it!
Yeah, sure, I understand. No need to decide now.
But I know that after you think about what you saw today, you'll realize that Skyrim deserves to be free.
Yes, mother. I'm eager to prove my skills today.
The air has the smell of beasts. The hunt is good today.
You don't think this is a war already? Sir, I...
Don't you think I know that? But these commands come straight from Cyrodiil.
Thank you, Legate. In the future, I'll let you know when your opinion is needed.
Sir, we can't just keep trading blows with the rebels like this - it's only strengthening their resolve.
Your concerns are duly noted, Legate, but unfounded. I assure you, this war will be over in another six months.
We must maintain order and put the rebellious Jarls in their place, before we have a full scale war on our hands.
Sir, this is costing lives of both imperial loyalists and Skyrim citizens alike. And it's winning the rebels support where they had none before.
You once told me you did not believe in destiny.
Indeed, you saw more clearly than I - certainly more clearly than Alduin. Rok funta koraav.
You're closer to understanding than you realize.
Whether you know it or not, Nocturnal dictates how well we perform as rogues.
The only difference is she doesn't demand payment in the traditional sense and sometimes the cost can be quite high.
You've no time to glory in your accomplishments.
Get up to Winterhold. We're going to take it back.
You've little time to glory in your accomplishments.
You're needed in Hjaalmarch. There's much to be done.
You're needed in Winterhold. Report to our hidden camp there.
Make your way to our camp in Falkreath. We're going to take it back.
I trust you've come to see the error handing the hold over to the rebels?
Get over to our camp in the Pale. It's time we bring them back into the fold.
Get over to our camp in the Reach. They need every able body they can muster.
We're ready to march on Solitude, but the Emperor's cousin is getting married!
Get over to our camp in Hjaalmarch. We need to strengthen our defensive position.
We're gathering for our final assault on Windhelm. Report to our camp in Eastmarch.
We're ready to march on Solitude, but the Emperor's visiting! The goddamned Emperor!
I hold you responsible for this situation. So, you better win me back Riften, or die trying.
Make your way to our camp in the Rift. We have a few surprises for the Stormcloaks lined up.
And don't think I've forgotten that you were the one that gave it to Ulfric in the first place.
And don't think for a moment I've forgotten it was you that lost us the hold in the first place.
We're gathering for our final assault on Solitude. I need you there. Report to our camp in Haafingar.
Hurry over to our military camp tucked away in the Reach. Ulfric's been enjoying those silver mines for far too long.
I suspect you'll be of greater use to us with greater freedom, so you're free to engage the Imperials as you see fit.
You'd be wasted as a regular soldier. I have special plans for you. You'll be of greater use to me with greater flexibility.
And, as much as I'd like to kill the man myself, we can't risk an all out war with the Empire. We'll bide our time for now...
Make your way to our hidden camp in the Rift. I can't continue to push forward when I'm worried about Eastmarch's southern border.
If royal blood was spilt, all of Cyrodiil would be up in arms. We can't afford an all out war with the Empire. So we'll bide our time for now.
Make your way to our hidden military camp in the Pale. Rikke will have important tasks for you, and will need you when we reclaim the capital.
But I also want you to find our hidden camp in Falkreath. Galmar will have special tasks for you, and will need you when we liberate the capital.
And, soldier. You better help win me back Markarth, or die trying. It was your brilliant strategy to give it over to the rebels in the first place.
I know you thought we weren't losing much when you gave it to the enemy. But I'm wasting troops guarding the border that belong on the front lines.
Your fruit are looking a little less ripe today.
Your selection looks very delicious. I'll take an apple.
It's those damned Blackblood Marauders. They're scaring off shipping.
One apple. Since the Blackbloods were dispatched I've had good luck getting shipments.
A fine place to trap one of Alduin's allies, hmm?
Perhaps the hofkahsejun - the palace in Whiterun... Dragonsreach. It was originally built to house a captive dovah.
Yes... one of his allies could tell us. Motmahus... But it will not be so easy to... convince one of them to betray him.
A smart man came and told us about a blade piece.
From my view, I don't think we'll find anything here.
Skjor thinks you should find it, and I'm supposed to watch you.
One of those icebrains who wanders the land getting people's hopes up.
You'd better hope there's still a chance for you to prove yourself, though, or this Trial might last longer than you'd like.
Ah yes. I remember your name from the guest list.
All right, we'll start again, but watch yourself.
I'll give you another chance, but watch yourself.
All right, just because it's you, we'll try again.
Try again? You and me? Fine, but I've got my eyes on you.
You want to try again? Fine, but I'll be watching you carefully.
You're testing my patience, but very well. I'll give you another chance.
And here's a little something for helping me out.
Another piece of glory. Good work, Shield-Sister.
Another piece of glory. Good work, Shield-Brother.
Because, because you are such a nice Breton, yes!
But don't you get it? She thought he was a troll!
I get it. It's funny. It just might upset your wife.
I'm not sure that's a good joke to tell with women present...
Eh, let her get upset. She'll be angry no matter what I say, might as well enjoy myself.
But if you want to get yourself killed, go ahead.
You're joking, right? Those bone-walkers will tear you limb from limb.
But you were not placed in harm's way on purpose.
Oh. J'zargo takes this to mean it did not go... well.
Still, you are a good friend to J'zargo now, for taking this risk. J'zargo thanks you.
This was not the intention, to be sure. It is true that J'zargo was slightly concerned there may have been... problems.
Captain, have you heard these stories of dragons?
Think about how ridiculous that sounds. Come now.
Elda, you know better than to believe every idiot traveler that wanders through.
But they're saying that one of them freed Ulfric... that he's in league with them.
Clear out the chamber, and I'll give you the key.
Enthusiasm. Good. Here's the key to the dig site.
Go... go right ahead then. Don't let me keep you.
I must have misheard you. Did you say you were leaving?
Good. I was hoping you hadn't forgotten about it.
As promised, here's your payment for bringing them to me. Got it as part of a fair trade from my client.
Ha ha! Oh, I knew I had a good feeling about you!
Here, my friend. A few septims, to show my thanks, hmm? And may that twisted little jester rot in a cell for a fortnight!
Ha! The most important question of all, that one.
But mind he bard, Mikael. Poncy little milk drinker, that one.
You'll want the Bannered Mare. See Olfina, she'll keep you swimmin' in mead.
You'll want the Bannered Mare. See old Hulda, she'll keep you swimmin' in mead.
Here, let me show you how an Orc learns to smith.
Books. Don't know why the Imperials like these so much. This should help the boy, though, Malacath willing.
Hmmf. Maybe you're the one talking to him then...
Do you think Tekla has been talking to Siddgeir again?
We've been over this, Den. Tekla does not share your secrets with Siddgeir.
Hopefully that answer will satisfy you. Good day.
I'll put it simply, so you'll understand. I advise the Jarl in matters of magic.
If the hold is faced with any threats or mysteries of a magical nature, I am called upon to explain things and suggest a course of action.
I find your presence... unnerving. Please depart.
You're making me... nervous. Is there something you need?
I just hope this party doesn't drag on all night.
Is it that obvious? I should take pains to seem more happy. I wouldn't want to upset our host.
But the truth of it is, I have a mountain of paperwork back in Windhelm and it's not getting any smaller.
I need you to come with me immediately. Let's go.
I tried to look for her, but she never turned up.
I just said that to make the poor guy feel better. I'm pretty sure she's dead.
Reyda would gather ingredients from the small island in the river east of here. Then one day, she just vanished.
I... knew Veren and Thorek. They were my friends.
Is this punishment for my past? Is it Mara's will to torment me so?
I'll give you one good reason. Maven Black-Briar.
Burn all the hives and she'd have to import honey for Black-Briar Meadery which would cut into her profits.
I've already told you everything I know, I swear.
I've been hearing rumors of Silver Hand activity.
Indeed. The temple here in the city is my charge.
After all, it is she who brings rain to our crops and fair weather on the harvest days.
The goddess's divine blessings have no doubt helped make Whiterun a thriving and prosperous city.
Is he? You've saved him?! I must see him at once!
It was like he was daring us to come and get him.
Hmph, yeah I did. That wood elf s'wit... he's a lot smarter than I expected.
Can you believe that fetcher had more than tripled the guard? There must be eight of them in there.
It's under your feet, lad. Just follow the smell.
It's under your feet, lass. Just follow the smell.
If I have to hold your hand through everything, maybe you aren't cut out for this kind of work.
It's very unfortunate that you've been suspended.
It's where men have tested their mettle for ages.
You kill an Ice Wraith out there, and I'll have all the proof I need about you.
There's a strange rock formation, built by the ancients. Something about that place attracts the Ice Wraiths.
Just be patient, aunt. She'll have it, I promise.
Svana! Has that skooma-addled idiot Niluva paid us her rent yet? Or does she have more excuses?
She said she'll have it soon. She still has her job at the meadery for now, so she'll be able to pay us.
Why do you insist on defending that woman? All she does with her money is spend it on that Dark Elf garbage!
Keep your wits about you and you won't be harmed.
True, he's a dangerous and blood thirsty man, but he's also a Nord that honors our traditions.
And then get back here. Because if Ulfric isn't bluffing, I'll need every able body to defend Whiterun.
Next thing I know, I've used up most of my stock.
No, no. Well, sometimes, but that's not the problem.
I just often don't have much to do, so I tend to... I try things out. They don't usually work, but I try.
No, not gone... he's become one with the shadows.
This is the greatest honor a Nightingale can possibly achieve. In death, he's become a part of that which we use to live.
Nocturnal seemed quite pleased with your efforts.
I'm glad you were able to bring the Key back safely.
Now, do you have a reason for making such a mess?
Names no longer matter. You may refer to me as The Caller.
Oh really? Well, I'm not going to hold my breath.
If you're going after those thieves, you should head to Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town.
You could? I've got some coin coming in from my last shipment. It's yours if you bring my claw back.
The thieves are up in Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town. I'd take you there, but with Lucan gone, I'm busy with the store.
Oh yes. And I've decided you will have the honor.
Oh, hello there. I didn't expect to see you here.
Yes, I am indeed. Elenwen always serves the best wine at her parties. The food is excellent as well.
Though I confess, being surrounded by so many wealthy and important people makes me feel more than a little nervous.
Oh, well. You know. A bit of this, a bit of that.
They haven't made me a guard, even though I've been asking. So I'll take odd jobs, anything that comes along for now.
Or give you strength if you happen to offend one.
Typically we avoid bestowing it upon men, but for the Sybil's escort, we could make an exception.
Have you heard of the Blessing of Dibella? It can help you with the wooing of women, if that's your aim.
You, my dear, can earn the Blessing of Dibella. You'll find men to be more pliable in the future... or more vulnerable.
Our ancestors should be allowed to rest in peace.
There's no chance anyone in authority approved this.
Out. She owns the place, she does what she wants.
Perhaps, perhaps. I'm not quite sure what I need.
You looking for anything in particular this time?
I'm fully aware of the terms of our... arrangement.
Well, you know the drill. You don't see it here, it's gonna cost you extra for me to get it.
She looked so fragile. Helpless prey. And then...
I held in my rage as long as I could. But it boiled inside of me.
When I saw the little girl, I was just... I could feel it coming on. I could taste the... I needed to hunt.
But this pitiful, limited body wasn't meant for hunting. Slow. No claws. Weak, mashing teeth for chewing cud.
I... I feel terrible about what happened. About what I did. It would probably be best for everyone if I just went away.
I had just come into Falkreath. They needed some help working the mill, and I thought that would be something safe. Something I could do.
Sigh. You win. Tell Shadr he can forget the debt.
Woah, woah. Calm down. Let's just think about this for a moment.
So you do. Thank you, this will help quite a bit.
Thalmor filth, eh? Giving all Khajiit a bad name.
Ah. You must mean that one over there. He's not one of us.
That he worries about being chased from Whiterun.
That he... that I'm...  that I don't have the same mother as my brother and sister.
I know that he still worships Talos. That he hates the Thalmor almost as much as the Stormcloaks do.
That's all there is to it, Dragonborn. Good luck.
[QUOTE]May the scales of the dragonkind splinter at the touch of your arrows and crack under the weight of your sword.[QUOTE]
The box contains the heart. The essence of a god.
The Dwemer were the last to touch it. It was thought to have been destroyed by the Nerevarine, but my lord told me otherwise.
I have devoted my life to the Elder Scrolls, but their knowledge is a passing awareness when compared to the encompassing mind of divinity.
The more important question is: why are you here?
I am here to assist those seeking the wisdom of the College.
And if, in the process, my presence helps to deter those who might seek to do harm, so be it.
The pettiness of mortals. I had almost forgotten.
Return when the elf lies dead and it will be yours.
I can grant you a powerful token for this task. An escutcheon of Dwemer make, capable of shielding you from both the spell and sword.
The return certainly seems worth the risk though.
Does she exact payment when we die? When we suffer does she revel in our misery? No one knows.
Nocturnal's whim is the greatest mystery to everyone. There have been volumes written on the subject.
There must be another way. The risk is too great.
Those draugr are going to be back. I can feel it.
Don't be such a coward. We haven't seen any draugr since the mine was cleared. Be grateful.
Viola, dark elves sleep just like the rest of us.
You wouldn't think it from the racket that Cornerclub makes.
I'm sure the guards have the matter well in hand. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Do you think those dark elves had anything to do with the murders? The attacks all happened at night, after all.
Well, well. I was looking for this little beauty.
If you happen across any other unusual trinkets like this, be sure and bring them to me. I promise it'll be worth the effort.
What are you doing here? I told them no visitors.
What are you talking about? What's in the letter?
Oh my. He... he wanted me to think Faendal wrote this?
Thank you for telling me the truth. Could you talk to Faendal, as well?  I'm sure he'll want to thank you for standing up for him.
What could drive a man to do something like this?
Sinding. Came through as a laborer. Seemed like a decent man.
He's stewing in the pit while we figure out what to do with him, if you've got the stomach to look at him.
Which calls to you, Dovahkiin? Fus, Feim, or Yol?
Yeah, you're right. Maybe it's not the best idea.
Yes, yes. What is it? We're all very busy here...
By the love of the Nine, what is it with you sycophants and hangers on? The jarl is busy! And so am I, for that matter.
You cannot eat Gleda! Gleda is protected by Grok!
You do realize there's only one way this can end.
Let me guess - you have some [QUOTE]business[QUOTE] to discuss...
You must defeat guardian beasts, blessed by Kyne.
You want this one to become a Blade? You're sure?
Are you sure? I'll need to ask them to take an oath to leave their old life behind and stay here from now on.
You will pay for Malyn's death, Azura worshipper!
You're right. She'll be a great Sybil, won't she?
Of course she will. She's our daughter, after all.
Enmon, dear, do you have any regrets? About letting her go?
No... no, we did the right thing. The temple will take good care of her, and one day she'll be helping all of Skyrim.
A new day is dawning. And you shall be its herald.
Malkoran is vanquished. Skyrim's dead shall remain at rest. This is as it should be. This is because of you.
Take the mighty Dawnbreaker and with it purge corruption from the dark corners of the world. Wield it in my name, that my influence may grow.
After all this, I have to pick up and leave again?
If you really think this is the only way, I trust you. Let's not waste any time.
Ah, at last! I hope you found the place all right.
Ah, Nivenor. What can I sell you on this fine day?
I'm looking for a necklace. Do you have anything with garnets?
I have a single one left, quite expensive, but also quite elegant.
Posh. I'm not paying for it. Put it on Bolli's account if you please.
And in my line of work, extra hands are well-paid.
I've got a bit of an errand to perform, but I need an extra pair of hands.
And it won't end here. I'd die before I went back.
And thank you for your help. You're a good friend.
But where will I go? I can't keep running forever!
Damn. It's like everyone in this city has amnesia.
Did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?
Now, did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?
I thought it was painfully obvious that Gulum-Ei was important to the Guild.
I'm sorry to say your payment for the job will have to go to elsewhere since you feel like taking things in your own direction.
Dragonborn? What do you know about the Dragonborn?
First, we're attacking the fort. I want that fort.
First of all, there's someone in particular I'd like to win over to our cause.
First, we're mounting an attack on the Fort. We aim to confiscate it from the rebels.
First of all, a son of Skyrim rots in an Imperial prison. We'll be getting him out of there soon.
First of all, I'd like to drum up some more support from the local populace. I have someone in mind.
First off, it seems that we might be able to blackmail the Jarl's Steward. I need to find out for sure.
First off, seems the Jarl's Steward might be vulnerable to blackmail. Need to investigate that possibility.
First of all, one of our men was captured by rebels who refuse to surrender him. So we're going to break him out.
First off, there's an Orc hanging around causing me headaches. Something about a vision quest he needs help with.
First off, they've got some rebels holed up in a nearby settlement. Need to clean them out so our boys can move in.
First, I need to get a handle on rebel operations. Need to discretely liberate some documents from their headquarters.
First off, we've learned the location of some rebels scouting our positions throughout the hold. Need to take them out.
First of all, I need to sew confusion and doubt through the rebel troops. I want to assassinate their commanding officer.
First off, there's a band of Imperials hiding in a nearby village. We're going to flush them out and put them to the sword.
First, we have information regarding the movements of a rebel courier. We need to intercept him and confiscate his package.
First off, there's a couple of Imperials skulking about the hold. Need to cut their throats so they can't make their reports.
First, we need to limit Stormcloak capacity and send them a not so subtle message by sabotaging a resource they claim to control.
First, if we can assassinate their commander, we'll be able to strike them while they're busy tucking their tails between their legs.
First off, there's a damn Orc hanging around getting in the way. He's been yammering on about needing help with some kind of vision quest.
First, I need to know what the Imperials are planning. Need to slip into their headquarters, grab plans, maps, something useful like that.
First on my list, is a problem with our supply caravans being constantly harassed by a giant. Need to deal with that hairy brute. And soon.
First, our intelligence suggests one of the rebel garrisons has become disaffected. If we play our cards right, we should be able to turn them.
First off, we hear a group of Imperial legionnaires are coming around to our way of thinking. With a little encouragement they'll join our side.
First, we've learnt the whereabouts of an Imperial cur fetching documents for his master in Solitude. We need to put a muzzle on that, don't we?
First problem here is a pack of Imperial dogs drooling over resources stolen from the people. A little sabotage will sour the taste of that victory.
The last few supply caravans have been attacked... by a giant. As if I didn't have enough to deal with. Need that damn hairy brute straightened out.
Fjotli...  Fjotli... Where have I heard that name?
Oh, of course, the poor girl who was murdered. Such a beautiful young thing... a tragedy to be certain.
Gods above... that's better news than I had hoped!
When you walked into my inn that day, I never imagined where it would all lead... dragons out of legend... Sovngarde...
He's the sorry bastard who's going to be executed.
A gate guard who let Ulfric Stormcloak escape the city, after he killed the High King.
Hold your head up. I'm sure it won't happen again.
Now that's just sad. Come back when you actually have something to show for your thieving.
How are the new breeds getting along with my dogs?
Haven't attacked each other yet. Good a sign as any.
I can provide you with some help with her minions.
Good. Being at the summoning created a connection to Potema, you are the one to do this.
I can't. If I do, I may as well cut my own throat.
I don't like bunking with Orcs. It's not... clean.
What I meant to say was... I love having an Orc here in the barracks. They're so... pleasant.
If you want me to leave, you could challenge me to a fight. I promise to stop once you've lost an arm.
I guess someone else will be taking his room, now.
Oh yes. I know everyone who sleeps in the Warrens. Kind of the one who passes the keys around.
I should hire you to be my assistant at this rate.
Let's improve the fit. Take this leather to the workbench over there.
I think given time, you'll understand what I mean.
I felt the same way when Gallus first revealed these things to me.
I want word on our campaign against the Imperials.
I, uh, I can't tell Thongvor. It's anyone's guess.
I see. Well, let's continue this discussion later then.
Oh, Talos's breath, Reberrus. Skip ahead to the good part.
What does that mean Reberrus? Are we winning or aren't we?
Oh, right. Oh, well, things are going well enough. At least, as well as we can hope.
I have a few very detailed missives from border patrols, beginning with Fifth Irregulars' reports on the movements of....
I'm going to track down that thief and murder him!
Yes! How'd you get this? Never mind, here. It's not much, but its something.
I'm paid to wait to take you home. Enjoy yourself.
What are you out here talking to me for? Party's inside.
The lady's already paid the fee. We leave when she gives the word.
Awful damn cold up here. And only the guests are allowed inside. Damn foreigners and their inhospitable ways.
I'm sorry to turn you away. I hope you understand.
But look... if you need work, Hod can always use help at the mill.
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm sure Arngeir would call it one of my failings.
I suppose the Greybeards care about Skyrim's troubles, in their way, but I needed to do something about it.
Yes. They chose me when I was just a lad. It was a great honor, of course. I was to become a Greybeard myself.
I spent almost ten years at High Hrothgar, learning the Way of the Voice. Then the Great War came... I couldn't stand missing it.
I often think about High Hrothgar. It's very... disconnected from the troubles down here. But that's why I couldn't stay, and why I couldn't go back.
If I needed something from you, you would know it.
Vampires are clever hunters. More clever than you, definitely.
If I tell you, you need to promise not to kill me.
I'd prove to be quite an asset to the Thieves Guild... I'm one of the best fences in Skyrim.
It doesn't matter. It's also none of your concern.
Just talk to him; see if you can convince him to give my amulet back.
It's done, then. Justice, if you can call it that.
Look, I want you to have this. I know it isn't much, but it's important to me.
Krosis. Sorrowfully, no. It cannot be known to me.
My son died. Things won't be the same without him.
My aunt died. Things won't be the same without her.
My wife died. Things won't be the same without her.
My niece died. Things won't be the same without her.
My uncle died. Things won't be the same without him.
My cousin died. Things won't be the same without her.
My cousin died. Things won't be the same without him.
My father died. Things won't be the same without him.

My friend died. Things won't be the same without him.

My nephew died. Things won't be the same without him.
My sister died. Things won't be the same without her.
My brother died. Things won't be the same without him.
My husband died. Things won't be the same without him.
My kinsman died. Things won't be the same without him.
My daughter died. Things won't be the same without her.
My boyfriend died. Things won't be the same without him.
My kinswoman died. Things won't be the same without her.
My girlfriend died. Things won't be the same without her.
No, I suspect Skyrim to be my home for many years.
The General's put me in charge of assisting the new governments.
The harshness of Skyrim has a way of carving a man down to his true self.
We'll need trained, disciplined and creative warriors ready for all that.
No, not yet. We'll wait for the Moot to name me High King. It'll be better for all that way.
Can't say I'm looking forward to that. But, I'll also be training men and women for their new armies.
Can't say I'll ever get used to the damn cold, or understand these Nords... but, I've come to respect them.
This is the land of my birth, the land that shaped me. I'm proud to have any part in making it strong again.
Heh. Ulfric's put me in charge of keeping an eye on the new Jarls. You know, make sure they're generally following orders.
The Empire may try to reclaim Skyrim, and I need everyone ready for that. Though the biggest threat, of course, is the elves.
I may understand things here in Skyrim better than the General, but I'm a soldier at heart, not a politician. But I'll do my best.
The Empire might send over a few Legionnaires to make sure we're serious, and of course, we'll be taking the fight to the elves soon enough.
But, that doesn't mean I won't start acting like it. There's much to do. The new Jarls need help building armies, and enforcing their right to rule.
Now... Now we see whether my theories are correct.
Oh she will, mark my words. And don't you let her.
Oh, good. I was really afraid I'd lose it forever.
Otherwise Vilkas will just say I was making it up.
You go if you want to. I've never seen bones this large, and want to make sure I remember them so I can tell the story right.
I'm going to stay a while. Rest among these bones. This creature honored us with its life, and I will honor it with my respect.
Perhaps someday I'll reopen a shop here in Skyrim.
I used to be. There isn't much time for that in my life anymore I'm afraid.
I actually owned a shop in Vivec City long ago, but I had to leave all that behind when the Red Mountain erupted.
Perhaps. But what is it you expect to find within?
Plenty of ways to worship the Divines as you know.
Ah a few bottles of Spiced Wine should hit the spot.
Of course. And I'm sure it's mostly for ceremonial purposes.
Really? All right! You pick. Tag or hide-and-seek?
Thank you. Take it to Quintus, in the White Phial.
Well, look at you, thanks. Take it to Voada, she handles all the dogs for the Jarl.
You're sure? When you see Giruad, ask for a tip. I'm sure he'll be in a good mood after reading this.
Thanks for sticking around and keeping me company.
It was nice to finally meet someone out here who doesn't want to rob you or take off your head.
I know it isn't much, but here, take this bow. It was given to me by my family. It's special to me, but brings back too many painful memories.
That's it! Wonderful! I knew I could count on you.
I don't have any money to give you. but I can show you a few tricks I learned playing for the Winterhold wizards.
The axe isn't the only item dear old Clavicus has.
Give him the Rueful Axe and once we're reunited the Masque of Clavicus Vile will be yours.
The key to wards is that they take time to charge.
Not long, but you can't start casting with a fireball coming at you.
Also, if your ward isn't negated by an incoming spell, it will recharge itself after a moment or two.
Just be careful. Casting wards requires constant concentration, and you can easily find yourself drained of your magicka reserves.
The witless fool and his pet corpse? Take a guess.
Though I admit, I find her Keeper a bit too exuberant for my liking.
Without the Night Mother, there is no Dark Brotherhood. The Matron deserves our unwavering support and respect.
Two hundred years ago, I would have lain down my life for the Unholy Matron. But that is an age long since passed. Astrid is my matron now.
Truthfully? I'm not entirely sure. It's not that I don't have the utmost respect for Sithis, and the Night Mother, and the ancient ways. I do.
But I've never been much for religion. I kill because it's what I've been trained to do. It's all I know. So long as Astrid is happy, I'm happy.
I don't like mimes, minstrels, thespians, acrobats, jugglers, troubadours or tumblers. Flutists give me a headache. I particularly hate jesters.
Their arrival is the best thing that's happened to this Sanctuary in years. Astrid is an effective leader, but we've been rudderless for too long.
Scrounging for contracts, abandoning the Tenets. The Dark Brotherhood has been reduced to a group of common cutthroats. Frankly, it's embarrassing.
As a rule, I'm also not crazy about the corpses of old women. For the Night Mother, I'll make an exception. But Astrid is the only mistress I serve.
Then prepare yourself to receive Stendarr's Mercy.
There's enough for all of us if you aren't greedy.
I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years.
It's not like my poaching is hurting anyone. The Jarl can hardly eat every deer now can he?
There's one more thing. We know about Paarthurnax.
I'm afraid there's a problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.
I'm afraid there's a further problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.
They've grown, all right - lazier and more stupid.
Your daughters are growing up fast, Lemkil. Seems like only yesterday they were newborn babes.
There's times I think you're the coldest man in Skyrim. This is your own flesh and blood you're talking about.
This is my realm. I won't let you take it from me!
Those draugr are going to come up and kill us all.
They haven't moved out of the caves. I think we're safe.
[QUOTE]We're safe[QUOTE] he says. You'll eat those words when a draugr is tearing into your face.
Time to finally see the sky, and make it rain red.
Try casting a spell at the wall. See what happens!
What in the world was that racket? Is everything all right?
There must be something about that amulet. Have you tried putting it on?
Vilkas, here, will be the one testing your mettle.
Calm down there, whelp. Don't feel like you need to show off for our sake.
Well now, that is something. Hand it over, please.
Well, looks like you're fitting in well down here.
I'm supposed to allow you to trade in one of your pieces of Guild armor, so what will it be?
Well, well. If it isn't Brynjolf's little protege.
You've broken the rules and now you need to pay... and it's going to cost you quite a bit.
I'm going to make this short and sweet, because frankly I don't think you deserve another shot.
Well, you seem like the honest sort. Here you are.
Right. You adventuring types would never go into a room just to steal everything.
What? You're... can it really be true? Dragonborn?
The prophecies are clear. Only the Dragonborn can stop Alduin.
You're right, I forget myself. I've lived without hope for so long...
Then... there is hope! The gods have not abandoned us! We must... we must...
Whatever I can to put my family here back to rest.
After that? Probably just stick around here. Saw some good game on my way here, and I'd like to stay close for a while.
Wonderful. Please follow me, and don't wander off.
Yes, I heard. I think all of Skyrim knows by know.
Brand-Shei, did you hear about Helgen? It's... it's gone! A dragon burned it to the ground!
Do you... do you think that could happen here? I mean, could a dragon come here and burn the city down?
I don't know. All we can do is hope the Eight will favor us and have these creatures stay far away from Riften.
Yes, my lady. I will pass the good news on to her.
My lady, Maven Black-Briar has sent word that she requires your seal in order to expand her shipments into Morrowind.
But of course! Tell her she'll have it. Maven is one of the few people I can trust and I'd be delighted to give her my blessing.
Yes, Thongvor. I'll draft the letter immediately.
Ha! About time we got some more muscle in this city.
Reburrus, I need you to draft a letter to Ulfric requesting more men.
Thongvor, do you really think that's wise? I mean, King Ulfric is such a busy man, and there are so many areas of Skyrim to protect.
Whose side are you on, Reburrus? I'm not worried about Skyrim, I'm worried about the Reach. Specifically, the part of the Reach we're standing on.
Yes, yes. Here it is. I think I'd best be off now.
You are a very brave man. But I already knew that.
You are a very brave woman. But I already knew that.
I envy you. Facing such a beast in combat. Smelling its blood on the air. That is what songs are sung about, Shield-Sister.
I envy you. Facing such a beast in combat. Smelling its blood on the air. That is what songs are sung about, Shield-Brother.
You are new here, are you not? We have not spoken.
You are relatively new here, are you not? I have noticed you, but we have not spoken.
You can have anything except the scroll of course.
You have reconsidered my offer, hmm? Onikaan kron?
You really don't know anything about this, do you?
Thorald... Thorald Gray-Mane? Fighting for the Stormcloaks, disappeared and believed dead?
You see - Paar-thur-nax - a Thu'um - a Shout, yes?
Ah, I forget how little you know of the dov. Our names are always made up of three Rotmulaag - Words of Power.
You there! Ah... citizen. This area is off limits.
You are interfering in Imperial business. Yeah, so you'll have to pay us a fine... of say, 100 gold. Pay up, citizen.
You there. You another Imperial puppet? Answer me.
You. Who are you to approach the Jarl of Markarth?
You're an idiot, Kleppr. Why did I ever marry you?
Not a day goes by I don't ask that question myself, my dear.
I don't know, my darling wife. I assume you're going to tell me?
All the wood furniture in this inn is rotting to the core. Do you know why that is, Kleppr?
Don't worry, my love. Just show the bugs your adoring face, and they'll scurry away in complete fear in no time.
It's rotten because the wood is cheap and its soaked with ale! Now we'll have to replace all the furniture before bugs set in.

After that I promised myself I'd never do it again.
The last jailbreak I attempted failed. I was imprisoned in High Rock for three years before they let me go.
Ah, this is good. But J'zargo will know them first.
It is good to finally be around mages who may be able to keep up with J'zargo.
Amazing! These must have been very hard to come by.
You've saved my business and warmed an old smith's heart. For that, I thank you.
And we'll cleave through the Legion to get to them.
You mean Ulfric's so-called [QUOTE]Stormcloak rebellion[QUOTE]?
But rest assured, citizen. We'll put an end to this uprising... and things will get back to normal soon enough.
Sadly, the Empire's stretched a little thin these days, and we've gotten very few reinforcements. So we've been forced to recruit locally.
Worse still, to pay for the privilege to keep his throne, the Emperor sells Skyrim and our very gods - Talos, no less! - to the damn elves.
The Nord kings - oh, excuse me, [QUOTE]Jarls[QUOTE] - they can't seem to control their own people. So the Legion has stepped in to keep order.
Ulfric did right killing him. Soon we'll rid Skyrim of elves, their bloody Justiciars, and the Jarls in their pockets. The whole damn lot of them.
Skyrim is the birthplace of humanity. The birthplace of honor. And those snowbacked Imperials renounced both when they laid down before the Thalmor.
And what did Torygg do? He and the Jarls that supported him? They took the Emperor's gold. Sold out their people for a slave master's [QUOTE]peace treaty.[QUOTE]
And you're right, at least as far as I'm concerned.
Don't let Ulfric or some of these other short-sighted Nords bother you. Most of us are happy to welcome newcomers.
Are you ready to see the world as only a dovah can?
Saraan uth - I await your command, as promised. Are you ready to see the world as only a dovah can?
Be careful. We need to find out what happened here.
I don't know about this Dragonborn business, but I'm sure glad you're with us.
That was the hairiest fight I've ever been in, and I've been in more than a few.
You better get back to Whiterun right away. Jarl Balgruuf will want to know what happened here.
I'm taking command here for the moment. You head back to Whiterun and let the Jarl know what happened.
We'd better go make sure that bastard is really dead. Collect us a trophy or something to bring back to Ulfric.
Scatter and get behind cover! We need to hurt it, somehow! If you've got a bow or spells, now would be a good time to use them!
But... we could use the breathing space to regroup.
I think you overestimate Ulfric's chances. He's stretched himself too thin.
True. A pause to consolidate our gains would be useful. And the Empire can afford to look magnanimous in victory.
But, as you say, these negotiations may offer a chance for his supporters to gracefully return to the Imperial fold.
Ulfric's insurrection has reached its high tide. Soon enough the rebel Jarls will realize what it means to oppose the Empire.
Done. Now move along, before you get me in trouble.
Enough to make a significant difference in the war.
Every bit as sharp as what you'll find in Whiterun.
I respect Eorlund, but he has the good fortune to work the Skyforge. Something about the fires... their steel just holds tighter.
Feel like doing a bit of shopping... the Guild way?
Every now and again, we like to remind the shopkeepers that we're in charge.
The owner of this place just inherited an heirloom from a relative. You want in?
Got a shop owner with a very choice item a client wants to get his hands on if you do the dirty work.
If that means breaking into their strongboxes and stealing something valuable from them, then so be it.
Got a client in desperate need for this item. He won't say what it's for, and we don't care. Can you take this one?
'Jiit caravan brought this shop a nice piece from Elsweyr. Think you can break into their strongbox and get it for us?
Got a good one here involving a shop, a waylaid shipment of goods and an angry client. You fill in the blanks. You want in?
I have just the place. The owner likes to stash some lovely trinkets in his strongbox like this beauty. Can you get it for us?
Sure. A client's relative lost this item in a gambling match and they're paying us to get it back. So much for fair play, huh?
The owner of this shop stiffed us on their last protection payment, but we're taking it anyway. You want to help us on this one?
Fine, but this isn't over Madena. We'll talk again.
What good is a court mage if she refuses to fight? Where's your sense of duty?
I told you before, Skald, I have no interest in taking sides in this war. I've no desire to be killed.
Madena, can we count on your spells to assist us in this war? The Empire is bound to bring their battlemages against us.
When I came here, my only duties were to cure crop diseases and occasionally light a bonfire on holidays. I didn't sign up to kill.
Generally posting information is need to know only.
Have you decided to do the right thing, Dragonborn?
Make your choice, Dragonborn. You're either with us or against us.
Justice can be harsh. But it is still justice. Paarthurnax deserves to die.
I wish there were another way, Dragonborn, but it falls to you to serve justice upon Paarthurnax.
He was cruel to her. He would beat her every night.
It's no wonder she fled in the middle of the night.
He... He gave me something just a little while ago.
He told me it was from Labyrinthian, and that I would know what to do with it when the time came.
Take it, and get out of here. Bring back that staff before Ancano brings the whole College down around us.
Also, I think you should take this amulet. It belonged to Savos, but I think would do you the most good now.
I think... I think he meant this for you, then. I'm not sure why, but there was something very personal about it for him.
Hmph. Yes. Yes, I believe you are. Very well, then.
You need to find and kill Safia, the captain of the pirate ship Red Wave.
The ship travels the northern coast, and sometimes isn't even in Skyrim at all. So you'll have to be patient. Good luck.
How dare that little fool! And right under my nose!
How in the name of Akatosh... How do you have that?
How thoughtful! I'll come take a look after supper.
I picked up a set of fine silver brushes in the city, Reldith. I thought you might be interested.
I can't express how much easier you've made my job.
Maybe Adelaisa will finally ease up, but I expect she won't.
Ah, yes, your pay. The Company thanks you for your services. Should we ever be able to help you, stop by.
I feel like we're mining even more ore than before.
It's the rush of good fortune, my friend. It makes you work harder.
I guess we should have expected this response, hmm?
I need your help with something. Something private.
I stand where I have always stood. Here in Morthal.
Now is not the time to fight amongst ourselves. I fear dark days approach and all of Skyrim's strength will be needed.
I think you and I are going to get along just fine.
Now you I like. I've been getting sick of the pushovers that usually walk in here.
I think you should continue with your performances.
All right, Wilhlem. I suppose it's the least I can do for you.
I think you play beautifully. It would be a shame if you stopped.
What's the point? I'm not very good, and it's only for the same few people every night.
I trust them completely, because I understand them.
When the Thalmor want something, they tell you straight. In my experience, they have no interest in subtleties and innuendo.
So if one of them says they're going to do something, I believe them. When you can just take what you want, there's no need to lie.
I'd be honored, but I have work to do in the mines.
I've been thinking, would you like to join me in hunting?
You want me to hunt with you? I thought you preferred being alone.
Your arms and legs are fit for catching strong, agile prey. I could use your help.
I'm happy to lend a hand as much as I can, as well.
These are difficult times indeed, when men stalk their brethren like beasts.
My men are stretched thin as it is. If you offer your aid, I gladly accept. The guards will be told to assist you as necessary.
I'm sorry about Roggvir. It's a shame, I liked him.
Greta is taking it hardest. She won't go to the Temple of Divines anymore.
I'm the best at breaking up rocks. Thorgar says so.
Thorgar says we'll find rocks soon, the kind worth gold.
It's cold in the mine, but Thorgar really needs me, so I stay.
Is it still worth it? When do you decide enough is enough, and just walk away?
The mine will be the talk of Skyrim soon, you'll see. It'll be the stuff of legends.
You're welcome to look around, of course, but understand that this place belongs to me.
I'm starting to think we might not even find iron in here. We've been at it for so long.
We were supposed to be rich by now, you know. Thorgar insisted we'd be swimming in gold.
I know they laughed when I said I wanted to keep the mine open. I'll show them. I'll show them all.
Any time I get tired of working, I just think that maybe that next swing will make me rich. It keeps me going.
Be careful where you step in the mine. Don't want to cover up some valuable ore, or gems, or... Or something...
It's a matter of time before the Jarl is coming to me asking for money. This mine is going to make me... I  mean us, rich.
It's going to happen soon, I just know it. We'll strike something better than iron. Silver, or maybe even gold. You'll see.
I've taken the first steps toward doing so already.
I met with several of the Dark Elves to discuss improvements in the Gray Quarter, but we have no real plans as of yet.
First we'll need to refill our coffers and stockpile stone and wood. The war took a heavy toll on Windhelm's resources.
But I swore an oath to our Dunmer friends that, for as long as I sit on the throne of Windhelm, their needs will not be ignored.
Important deliveries to make! No time for chatting!
It looks like you're ready to speak with the Augur.
Let Ulfric try to make it past our combined forces.
You've returned with my axe. I knew that would be his response.
I'll turn you back over to your Legion. Legate Cipius will have use for you. Gods be with us all.
As soon as you left I sent word to General Tullius, who's been kind enough to lend us some of his troops and Legate Cipius here.
Look at you. Such a devoted student of Restoration.
It's comforting to see that not everyone has dismissed it as entirely as most members of the College. Truly comforting.
Margret. He... he killed her. Right in front of me.
He... he tried to kill Margret. Right in front of me.
Murder. Banditry. Assault. Theft. And lollygagging.
No, no... Maramal... we talked about this. Talen...
Very well, Talen. I'll remove myself from this den of iniquity.
People of Riften, heed my words. The return of the dragons is not mere coincidence.
We're not kicking you out, just keep the sermons at the temple and let us all sin in peace.
This is one of the signs. The signs that Lady Mara is displeased with your constant inebriation.
Put down your flagons filled with your vile liquids and embrace the teachings of the handmaiden of Kyne.
Keerava, certainly we can come to some sort of an understanding. These people must be made aware of the chaos they've sown.
Enough, Maramal. We've all heard of the dragons and their return. There's no need to use them as an excuse to harass our customers.
No, no... please, I'm just tired is all. Thank you.
Wujeeta, you're worrying me. You look so... well, so sad.
Look, if you're in some sort of trouble, I could talk to Haelga.
Don't worry about it, Svana. It's my problem... no need for you to get involved.
Not well at all, and I'm happy to keep it that way.
That woman and her Thalmor Justiciars have caused nothing but problems for the people of Skyrim.
Of course! I've seen you at the Flagon. My mistake.
Oh my, how wonderful! Lady Mara will be so pleased!
Here you are. Now make sure you give out every single one, we can't afford to let even one lost soul stray from Her warmth.
Oh, for the love of Mara, would you please just go?
Your payment awaits. And don't worry, I'm not stupid enough to betray you.
Oh, thank the gods. Here, take this with my thanks.
Oh, yes? I wonder what that old busybody wants now.
Whatever it is, it will have to wait until after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation.
And I'm sure he told you it was urgent. Well, he's not the only Jarl in Skyrim with problems to deal with.
Or perhaps there's something you'd like to confess?
Pull up a chair, my friend... this is quite a tale.
When I started out in this business, I wasn't really interested in the Guild or being a thief.
Regrettably, I cannot reach your plane so directly.
But I forgive you for not knowing who I am. Few hear my whispers anymore.
The boy was good at sussing out secrets. You, I expect to take a more active role.
So, the prodigal murderer returns. And the Gourmet?
Ah, you're back. Ready to try again, are we? Let's start from the top. You were sent to kill the Gourmet. And he is...
Tell me as soon as you've given Camilla the letter.
That letter ought to convince Camilla to never speak to Faendal ever again.
Here. Give Camilla this letter. It's full of venomous nonsense. Tell her it's from Faendal.
You may be right. Camilla may see Faendal as little more than a friend, but why take chances?
Faendal thinks he can woo Camilla Valerius away from me. She's already mine, I keep telling him.
The bastards... somehow they managed to kill Skjor.
The cold stone, the dampness... it suits me, Svana.
Madesi, why don't you just take a bed here? There's no need to sleep in Beggar's Row.
You have a kind heart; much too kind for Riften. Don't worry about me, I'll be just fine.
Are you sure that's the real reason? It wouldn't have anything to do with others making an Argonian unwelcome, because if it is...
The guards say no draugr have come out of the mine.
That's comforting. Glad they're keeping watch instead of getting rid of the draugr.
The Jarl has things under control. Don't you worry.
Now you're being ridiculous. This is our city. Not theirs.
This was their city once. They won't stop until we're all dead.
A Forsworn agent. Running loose in the city. The Jarl is going to hear about this.
They may be cowards, but I'm not. I'll go with you.
Think carefully where your loyalties lie... sister.
Think carefully where your loyalties lie... brother.
I don't know why I expected even-handed treatment from you.
Unfortunate, but someone else will take care of it.
You've already turned down a job that I had for you.
You're not afraid, are you? Of animals? Come back when you find your spine.
I see. Well, should you change your mind, the contract will be available for a while.
Be cautious. Beasts are not nearly as predictable as men. Give the thing a quick death.
Work needs doing, and if you're not up to it, maybe you're not cut out to be a Companion.
I knew we could count on you. Get it taken care of right away. Nobody wants an animal left roaming around in their place.
Good. I knew that we could count on you. It's simply a beast, but be cautious. The beasts of Skyrim are made of sterner stuff than most.
Vald? Good side? I think you have the wrong person.
The only thing Vald understands is gold. A man after my own heart.
Very good. I'm sure the Jarl will be quite pleased.
Pleased enough to justify the significant amount of gold offered to the College to rectify the problem.
Excellent news. Were it to have gotten out of hand, it could have become a major problem for the College.
Well done. Not many enchanters could pull that off.
It's wise to carry a few summoning enchantments around.
Watching you reminds me of my first days as an enchanter.
Ah, fire. A capricious element. Often deadly, but always exciting.
That's a decent enchantment. But keep studying, you've only scratched the surface.
Now that's how it's done! I doubt anyone in Skyrim could have weaved a better enchantment.
It's intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lightning, is it not?
Well, if you change your mind, you know what to do.
Well, you were deep in your cups when you got here.
You were ranting but most of it was slurred. You said something about Rorikstead.
Now if you were to help tidy up and perhaps apologize afterwards... I might be able to help you.
Oh, I'd love to help you figure it out, but I'm so busy cleaning up the mess you made of our temple...
Whatever happened to Ennodius? He just up and left.
You're all heart, Kodrir. I bet Lady Mara is weeping a special tear for you right now.
Don't know why you're asking me. But I'm glad that damn Imperial is gone. Something wrong about him.
Yeah, I figured it would be like that. Here you go.
Yes, I could use someone to fetch something for me.
Well, when I say fetch, I really mean delve into a dangerous ruin in search of an ancient stone tablet that may or may not actually be there.
Yes. Vahzah. You speak true, Dovahkiin. Forgive me.
It has been long since I held tinvaak with a stranger. I gave in to the temptation to prolong our speech.
You can use Nettlebane to retrieve some of its sap.
Eldergleam's sanctuary grove is to the east of here.
You idiot. You came all the way down here for that?
You set this chain of events in motion at Saarthal.
You stupid cow. You don't know what you're missing.
So, Sapphire. Can I do anything for you, or more to the point... to you?
No, but I know that you're going to turn up missing if you keep up this kind of talk.
Vipir [QUOTE]the Fleet.[QUOTE] The only man who's foolish enough to name himself after his bedroom prowess.
You will? Really? Well, okay, here's the situation.
You're crazy! How dare you make such an accusation!
Huh? What are you talking about? I don't even know what that is.
I have no idea what you're talking about. I'd never sleep with anyone besides my good wife, Drifa.
You've already taken care of it?  Thank you friend.
A true Nord places loyalty and honor above all else.
I was Dengier's personal guard for years. I risked my hide more than once to protect him.
Why would I do that? For money? Because I swore an oath? No, it was because he was a good man and a true friend.
All right then, your secret ingredient's been added.
Heh, I'm sorry. Of course. It's your most famous recipe, after all.
All right, all right. You're mean when you're sober.
You think you can bully me. I grew up with five brothers. Go... get...my...ring.
You said you the ceremony was going to be in Morvunskar. You said your friend Sam was going to be your best man.
And here you go... your payment, just as I promised.
The way things have been going around here, it's a relief that our plan went off without a hitch.
And please accept this gift from my personal armory.
But I haven't forgotten the service you did for me in retrieving the Dragonstone for Farengar.
As a token of my esteem, I have instructed Avenicci that you are now permitted to purchase property in the city.
And why should I speak with you? You broke my heart.
What do you want? There's no words left to say to each other.
We have nothing to talk about. I can't believe what you did to me.
Look at you. Come crawling back, after everything you've done to me?
Your words are cheap. Why should I speak to you after what you've done?
You. You should just go. I don't have enough ale to stomach talking to you.
I can't believe you're speaking to me, after what you've done. You broke my heart.
And, as promised, here's my trade. Hope you like it.
Perfect, just perfect! These should help keep my stock fresh for quite a while.
At last! I have searched for this drum for 20 years.
The college treasury is a bit thin right now. But I can show you some tricks I learned from my days with the army.
Aye. I'm the headsman here in Solitude. It's my job.
Besides, it will be good to see High Hrothgar again.
You speak truly, Dragonborn. Sometimes the grubby business of politics clouds my eyes.
But I never dreamed that I would even get to see it.
I am honored to be called for this duty. Please, lead on.
I've heard stories about the wonders of the great Temple in Markarth.
But why would you risk your life for me, a stranger?
I cannot thank you enough for rescuing me from this place. I suspect I'd never again see the light of day otherwise.
By the way, if you're looking for something to do...
Destined for the chopping block if I'm not mistaken.
Eventually your curiosity will drive you back to me.
Suit yourself. But those who listen at doors always wonder what is beyond them.
Fine. You want to know what the Forsworn really are?
Fools! You will not hold me here any longer, Valdar!
Fresh fish sounds like just the thing today, Addvar.
Thank you, Addvar, I am picky about what I eat these days.
I've been pushing the Salmon but I'll tell you the Slaughterfish is a bit better today.
Gold, silver. Gems, maybe? Only one way to find out!
Her marriage band? Then there's hope - she was here!
I have to move on if I want to find her. Please, take the coin I promised. Blessings of Stendarr on you!
I believe King Olaf's verse will provide that proof.
As you may be aware Elisif's husband High King Torygg was recently killed.
I've tried to convince her the festival is many centuries old and celebrates Solitude but I need proof.
Elisif mourns her husband deeply and she feels that a festival that burns a King in effigy is... distasteful.
I don't know you. You in Riften lookin' for trouble?
I know all the good spots! You don't stand a chance!
You stand right there and count to 10. No peaking. Ready? Okay go!
I moved here from Helgen after my family was killed.
At the time I couldn't stand to be around anyone. They all felt sorry for me and I didn't want them to. It was my problem, not theirs.
I never thought I'd see another friendly face again.
We need to get to safety as soon as possible. Let's move.
I suppose you want something for your trouble? Here.
Ah yes, the extract, good. Poisonous, of course, but it has its uses.
I think you'll do more than just fit in around here.
That's the spirit! Larceny's in your blood... the telltale sign of a practiced thief.
I trust you'll be finished with Fort Hraggstad soon?
I'm a growing boy. I need as much food as I can get.
I ain't afraid of the old hag. Still, I wish Constance was in charge. She treats us real good.
Constance, sometimes she gives me little snacks. Which is good, 'cause we only get but one meal. Late, too, in the afternoon.
I'm amazed you even bothered to show your face here.
So you're the one that burned down Goldenglow Estate.
So, you're the one. Hmm. You don't look so impressive.
Do you have any idea what that little stunt you pulled is going to cost me?
I'm sorry, I'm just... you're right. Let me explain.
If I was threatening you, believe me, you'd know it.
Think that's water in the river? Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth, friend.
You outsiders never learn. If the Forsworn don't get you, the guards will throw you in Cidhna Mine to work your fingers off.
If that's how you choose to end your life, so be it.
If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way.
Ignore me all you want, you still aren't getting in.
In exchange for Riften, the jewel of Skyrim? Hardly.
Whiterun seems like a better choice to me. From there we can threaten to undermine the whole Imperial position.
In exchange for Riften, the jewel of Skyrim? Hardly. How about the Reach? Gaining control of the silver mines would be invaluable.
It's time we had a real king. One of our own making.
There hasn't been a true High King in Skyrim for generations.
For too long he's been hand-picked by the Emperor, and given emphatic nods by milk-drinking Jarls addicted to Imperial coin.
Just remember I'm here if you rethink your decision.
Just visiting. I had some business here. That's all.
Knowing this, are you ready to undergo the ceremony?
Once the Oath has been struck, the terms are binding.
Let me look.  This is a very exciting moment for me.
Meet me then if you've still got the stomach for it.
Now, you tell me when you're ready and we'll get started.
I'll be out in the market all day, from eight in the morning until eight in the evening.
There's someone that wants to see him put out of business permanently. That's all you need to know.
Miss Stentor, watch your tongue in the Jarl's court!
Very well. But I suspect her grace will not be pleased.
Steward, I will need the following reagents for my studies. Please see to them.
On threat of what, exactly? This city wouldn't run without me! Now if you'll excuse me, my work awaits.
Miss Stentor, these are quite expensive. I trust you know how limited the hold's funds are at this time?
And? I've seen jarls come and go. This one only became Jarl because her husband died. She'll be replaced in a matter of months.
Yes, and I'm also aware of how necessary my divinations and wards have been in the city's defense. My experiments are all I ask for in return.
Move quickly so we can have this over and done with.
We're trusting you on this one. Bring honor to the Companions.
Good, good. These aren't the most glorious jobs, but they pay well.
Moving into her quarters was an interesting process.
And keeps herself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...
And keeps himself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...
No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart man steers clear of Stentor.
No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart woman steers clear of Stentor.
Now that Sybille Stentor is out of the picture, I am indeed. And the court is, well... free of her... eccentricities.
My husband. He was the blacksmith up at Castle Dour.
Beirand's my husband. He works the forge up at Castle Dour. I barely see him nowadays, what with him filling orders for the army.
Not entirely true, though not entirely false either.
My shouting Torygg to the ground proved he had neither.
However, it was my sword piercing his heart that killed him.
Any Nord can learn the Way of the Voice by studying with the Greybeards, given enough ambition and dedication.
Not excited, no. Some very bad things happened here.
I think, given the state of Skyrim, some might disagree.
Are you excited to see what's in there? This is important to you Nords, isn't it?
Oh, right. That whole thing with the elves. Well, it all worked out in the end, didn't it?
Of course I am. What do I look like, a tavern wench?
I am. I came into Arkay's light after the Great War. So many died by my hands, my magics.
I'm fortunate that Kust and the people of Falkreath have come to accept me as one of their own.
I found the ring's resting place after he died, but I'm far too old to go exploring some cave, now.
Could you do an old elf a favor? I misplaced my journal in a cave I was exploring. I'll pay for its return.
Yes. I've wandered a bit, but I always come back to Kynesgrove. My clan was one of the first to settle here.
Ah, don't let my words cut you too deep. I've just been working the forge too hard. Trying to set this sword right.
I was the finest scout in the Legion, once. Tracked down all the places in the wilds that were causing people trouble.
Of course, there's another story of Lenne losing the family shield in a different cave, so it depends on who you believe.
Legend says that my forefather Lenne discovered the mines after he stumbled into a dark cave to relieve himself. Too much mead.
My husband. We used to go out in the wilds and collect ingredients together. He used to call me his [QUOTE]pretty Juniper.[QUOTE]
Lost my helmet in one of the old caves. My pretty, pretty helmet. Life just got worse after that. Kept losing things. So many things....
It's quite romantic, if you're an alchemist. Frost took the old fool a few seasons back, while he was looking for the Ring of Pure Mixtures.
Of course you'll get a cut. We take care of our own.
Now if you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Get going.
Offer yourself up as a sacrifice while you're there.
You persist? Fine. You go tell Malacath to lift this curse from me. See how well he listens to you.
Oh, really? Well then... how can I make that happen?
When you're in your grave and I'm standing over it. Now get out of my way!
So, what do you think, my dear? Could a beautiful woman like you ever see yourself with an old codger like me?
Please, ask him what she likes. It's my only chance.
There is one... Yngvar. He's quite popular with the ladies.
Thankfully Faleen is not quite his type, but they've been friends for some time, and he may have some ideas.
Reason, reason, reason. Your kind and their reasons.
Return Wuuthrad to Ysgramor. It should open the way.
So I'm finally seeing you with a smile on your face.
It's this place. It feels like home. It's just nice to finally have something going right in my life.
So unless you're here to dig, you don't belong here.
It's the most secure prison in Skyrim. Throw scum in, close the gates. No one gets out.
This is a jail, owned by the Silver-Blood family. We use the prisoners to mine for ore.
Sorry. Margret might be dead, but the room's rented.
Well, I guess Margret isn't around to complain. It's yours.
Speak your mind, Bryling. You're among friends here.
And besides, no Nord with a shred of honor would consider it. We're no cowards.
Too often the general has lost good soldiers because he did not take Ulfric and his men seriously.
There's something that's been troubling me, Falk. I am hesitant to share it, but I feel that I must.
Yes, of course, but Ulfric's message is a powerful one. More of our people flock to his cause every day.
We don't have the luxury of hanging back to see who wins before choosing our friends, Bryling. You know this.
You know that I support the Empire, as we all do. However, I fear General Tullius is underestimating the Stormcloaks.
If this continues, and the worst comes to pass, Solitude will pay the price. The Empire is headquartered here, after all.
Have faith, Bryling. When this war is over and Ulfric is dead, you'll see that you were jumping at shadows, and nothing more.
Speak, if you have aught to say worth the listening.
Takes coin to pay a fine. And you don't have enough.
Done. Convince him to stay out of the city while you're at it.
Tell me, mother, does Malacath favor our stronghold?
He is pleased. Ours is the strongest tribe in all the Reach.
Thank you, dear friend. You've given me back my son.
[QUOTE]...for it bears aloft next summer's seeds.[QUOTE] That's my boy.
So it's true, then. For now, it's enough to know that he's alive. I can find peace in that.
Thank you. May Arkay bless you. I won't forget this.
Thank you. Please, do not open it. It is... private.
That's a shame. What's causing them all the trouble?
Chin up, Brand-Shei. Lady Mara will provide us strength and guidance through these difficult times.
There's the stories about Helgen, bandits, skirmishes between the Stormcloaks and the Imperials... it almost seems endless.
Dinya, about that incense you requested? Its not arriving anytime soon. The Khajiit caravans are having tough times getting through.
That's quite an accusation. I assume you have proof?
The Blades have never followed that path, of course.
Do not confuse inaction with indifference. Often the wisest course is to wait and watch events unfold, until the time to act is clear.
The cycle of retaliation may continue for some time.
Your hearts are full of grief, and my own weeps at the loss of Skjor.
But his death was avenged long ago. You have taken more lives than honor demanded.
We don't need no help from the Empire on that count.
I was once, but not any more. I was wounded in a skirmish up near Windhelm. This was years ago, mind you.
Now, maybe I don't pick up a blade in Ulfric's name no more, but I still hold with his ideals. Skyrim is Nord land, and we ought to rule it.
We have to go out there before she disappears again.
There's only one place that could be. The place where she murdered Gallus... a ruin called Snow Veil Sanctum.
Well, then this should be no problem at all for you.
Well... all right. What exactly do you need to know?
What is it? I said I didn't wish to... be disturbed.
Wonderful. I'll write it out so you won't forget it.
Hmmm. I don't think you've got enough to cover my expenses with Silver-Bloods, much less convince me give my words away.
Yes, actually. You look like you're lousy with gold.
No, I guess not. Well, get out of here before I change my mind.
Yes, but they'll come around eventually. You'll see.
Jonna, do you think the townspeople are warming to my serenades?
Oh, I shouldn't be surprised if they come 'round. And if you're never seen or heard from agin.
No. They ain't. And they aren't gonna. If you weren't payin' for your room, I'd have thrown you out a long time ago.
You are trying my patience, citizen. Back away. Now.
Keep back, citizen. I have important business I must attend to.
You make one move towards my skooma, and I shiv you.
Have any skooma? I need to get something from Grisvar.
You were just going to prove that you're Dragonborn.
Dragons, is it? Does that make you the fabled [QUOTE]Dragonborn[QUOTE] we've heard mention of?
You will pay for stealing from me you eyeless freak!
The boss is going to cut those creepy cave people to pieces!
I hope one comes running up here so I can stab it right in the face.
I will take you down too. I am not splitting this horde with anyone.
Yeah! It'll teach them to steal from us! One of them took my good helmet.
I would be fine if they didn't.  Have you seen their eyes? They don't have any! Gross.
You, though, I expect will prove far more malleable.
The boy is good at sussing out secrets, but the corruptibility of children is ultimately too limited for my purposes.
You'll have to make do with what we have, Proventus.
My lord, our provisions are running dangerously low. Our stores of meat, wine and grain are all but depleted.
Purchase more supplies, then. That's your job as Steward, isn't it? Why do you trouble me with these details?
Our coffers are nearly empty. I can scarcely afford to pay the guards, and we need every one of them in these troubled times.
My lord, since Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising, the cost of goods has doubled. I'll need more coin if I'm to provision us properly.
You're not short of guts, are you? What's your game?
Alright. I believe you. You aren't the first to turn away from the Empire in disgust.
Now, to prove yourself to me, I have a task for you. Take my axe, and deliver it to the Jarl of Whiterun.
Why would Tullius waste resources getting the crown only to give it to me? Poisoned perhaps? No. He's not that cunning.
But remember - you're one of us now, forever. Whatever Imperial loyalties you may have had... that's all in the past, forgotten.
A few bad apples spoil the bunch. You know how it is.
Reputation, mostly. A lot of Khajiit turn to smuggling and thievery to get by.
A venison pie, maybe? With a nice cup of mulled mead?
Eorlund, dearest, are you hungry? Would you like me to fix you something?
Ah, you want protection? I can get you what you need.
Maybe you can do something for me, first? Duach has a bottle of Skooma. Finest distilled Moon Sugar. I'm shaking just thinking about it.
Although I fear the Jarl may not be easy to persuade.
May the strength and truth of your Voice serve you well. Breath and focus.
Ah! Dragonsreach! There are many difficulties, but I cannot think of a better plan.
Remember, the Way of the Voice trains you for more than battle. Indeed, we believe that battle is the least of its uses.
We are not warriors. What is overlooked in the Dragonborn is not permitted to any other followers of the Way of the Voice.
And please, let's just... Let's keep this between us.
Thank you again. If I require anything else, I shall be sure and let you know.
Ah, that's excellent news. This will be most helpful in furthering my research.
I simply need more pieces of Dwemer equipment to study. It's nothing dangerous... At least, not necessarily.
I'm afraid I can't offer you much right now, but please take this. And perhaps, if this is all successful...
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's too early to be getting excited. Still, this is most encouraging.
And we've done as much as we can to prepare for that.
But remember, Whiterun is home to the Companions. Any dragon that comes here will get more than he's bargained for, I think.
Aringoth sold Goldenglow? What's that idiot thinking?
If only this parchment had the buyer's name instead of this odd symbol. Any idea what that might be?
He has no idea the extent of Maven's fury when she's been cut out of a deal, but I'm certain he'll find out.
Atub! Meddlesome woman... You would help us? Help me?
Tell me, outsider. Can you banish spirits? For that is what I need.
By the gods! I know this looks bad. Let me explain...
Can I have it?  It's worthless to you, but I can pay.
Damn right. Just like all true sons of Skyrim should.
I'll be sure to put in a good word if I get to Windhelm ahead of you.
Damn right. You don't have to be a Nord to fight for Skyrim's freedom.
Ulfric's capital is Windhelm, northeast of here. You'll want to talk to Galmar Stone-Fist, Ulfric's right-hand man. He handles the new recruits.
Delve to its limits, and Blackreach lies just beyond.
Under deep. Below the dark. The hidden keep. Tower Mzark.
Alftand. The point of puncture, of first entry, of the tapping.
But not all can enter there. Only Septimus knows the hidden key to loose the lock to jump beneath the deathly rock.
Do you ever find that you regret making this journey?
Yes, I know just what you mean. My toes are numb from the cold more often than not.
We have been in this land for so long, I have forgotten what it feels like to walk on warm sand.
In truth, I do not. I have always dreamed of seeing new lands, and it does not hurt that we are making a good profit.
That is true. Perhaps I should be more grateful for this opportunity. Not many Khajiit can say that they have visited Skyrim.
Farengar can explain the situation better than I can.
Bring back this tablet that Farengar wants and I'll be in your debt.
I'll introduce you to Farengar. He can be a bit... difficult. Mages. You know.
Farengar is probably puttering around in his lab. Day and night. I'm not sure he ever sleeps.
That tablet is your priority now. Bring that back from Bleak Falls Barrow and I'm sure we'll have a lot to talk about.
Fiend! You will not leave here alive! Guards! Guards!
Fihada, where did you learn how to make bows so well?
Wish I could learn some of that charm. I'm just good with bows, not people.
The same place I learned my charm and quick wits: I used to be an Imperial ranger, my boy!
You'd make a better Imperial ranger than me. I may have charmed the locals, but my fellow soldiers hated my waggling tongue.
Fine, then wait here. This should only take a second.
First you murder my sister, then you massacre my men!
You've betrayed me, murdered my sister and massacred my men!
For now, give this [QUOTE]Ratway[QUOTE] a wide berth.
I say we go down there and clear the place out, just like old times.
Well, you were right. These so called 'Gutter Saints' live in the sewers beneath.
I suspected as much. The real question now is do we do something about it ourselves or do we speak to the Jarl?
No, my friend. That would be reckless. We have to help, but help in a way that doesn't directly place anyone in harm's way.
Go on, get moving! I'll try and clear a path for you.
There's no time! You have to get back to the College as fast as you can!
Mirabelle is dead, and they're losing ground fast. I'd be there now if I hadn't seen... I had one of your 'visions', I think.
Gods, I can't run away from this. I have to stop her.
The Initiation. My mother is going to become one of those things. I can't be a part of that.
Good. He will have fled to gather others of his kind.
Good. Then you will be ready for whatever lies ahead.
Good. You make sure the lug tips you when he gets it.
Gotta have a sharp axe to cut through all that fat...
Hurry up with it, we've got a merchant in the pit to take care of after we carve this thing up.
Ha, what a coward. Didn't even put up a proper fight.
He's a stubborn oaf. I don't know what good it'll do.
Go right ahead. He just might be sober enough to listen to you.
You can try, but we've gotten nowhere talking to him ourselves.
You're going to try to talk sense into that Orc? I'll believe it when I see it.
If you could convince him that I don't care about his tab, it'd certainly make me feel better.
If you want to try, go right ahead. I don't think anything will get through that thick skull of his, though.
He's my cousin. Just give him another chance. Please.
There are no shipments scheduled today. Stop covering for him!
Fine, I won't fire him, but I'm doing this for your sake. Not his.
He's just waiting for the shipments, Lisbet. He'll be back as soon as they come in.
Where's Cosnach, is that lazy idiot out drinking at the Silver-Blood Inn again? On my coin?
Hey, I'm not done talking to you yet. Come back here!
Hey, where do you think you're going? Come back here.
Hmph. I should have known better than to ask a knave.
Hmph. Music tames the most savage beasts. Even Nords.
You'd better hope the war's over by then. The Stormcloaks would eat you alive!
Lady Ateia has already arranged for me to perform in the court of the Jarl of Falkreath.
What're you going to do after you graduate? I'm thinking of joining the Legion. I hear they're looking for skalds. Just think. Me - a war bard.
I don't care, but my ancestors do. You can't have it.
You want the hilt that bad? Fine. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.
I have everything under control. Thanks for offering.
I just don't understand what kind of a man does that.
I must have forgotten. I'll take care of it tomorrow.
See that you do. You're an embarrassment, Horgeir. I don't know why I married you.
Faida came by today. She says you left the tavern last night without paying for your drinks.
I need dragon scales. And not just any dragon scales.
I would hate to see our reputation further tarnished.
I'll remain in this location until ordered otherwise.
Yes, Listener. I won't move unless you give the word.
Yes, Listener! I will remain in this very spot until you tell me otherwise. Spiders could eat my face off and faithful Cicero would not move an inch!
I'm not from here. I'm a sellsword. These are my men.
If I were you, I'd keep my feet dry and stay up here.
It's our name for the old sewers that run under the city.
Disgusting. Ruined sewers filled with goodness knows what.
I'd go down there myself, but that would leave Jarl Laila unprotected.
It's Riften's name for the sewers beneath our feet. Absolutely disgusting!
Everyone knows the Thieves Guild uses the old sewer system beneath Riften as their hideout.
It used to be a huge system hundreds of years ago but it fell into decay just like the rest of Riften.
If you fancy keeping your purse filled with gold and your head on your shoulders, I'd stay out of those awful tunnels.
The Guild stocks the place full of thugs that aren't good enough to join, so watch yourself if you venture down there.
There's an entrance down by the canal, but I'd highly advise you stay out of there... its the Thieves Guild's territory.
There are ruined sewer tunnels beneath the city. The only way I know how to get in there is through a door off of the canal.
If that doesn't interest you, feel free to walk away.
It's none of your concern. All you need to know is that we're paying for information.
If we can't get back into the mine, our town is sunk.
I'd give my eye teeth if it meant getting those damn spiders out of the mine!
No one's been hurt yet, and they seem to be staying in the mine, but who knows how long that will last?
Moved right in and made themselves at home. Did it overnight. I'm not even sure exactly where they came from.
One day we were cracking rocks in the deepest parts of the mine and the next day they were all over the place.
If you go there, talk to Viarmo. He's the headmaster.
At the Bards College in Solitude. They train bards and skalds like myself.
I'm a bard, from the Bards College here in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying.
I'm a bard, trained at the Bards College in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying.
It is. We train the bards you hear throughout the land. Viarmo is the head of the college and in charge of admissions.
Only in that I'm a graduate. I work over at the Winking Skeever. I would highly recommend it though. Talk to Viarmo if you're interested.
Only in that I'm a graduate. I work at here at the Winking Skeever. I would highly recommend it though. Talk to Viarmo if you're interested.
It's so good to have everyone around the table again.
Eola is a fine host. She really keeps the faithful together.
I'm just glad we had this, now. I was almost getting ready to eat my servant and blame it on the Forsworn.
Jarl Olaf One-Eye it was, who later became High King.
The hofkahsejun has been known as Dragonsreach ever since.
Numinex was the dragon's name. That's his skull decorating the main hall.
According to legend. Although I never thought to put the tale to the test.
I do not know how he came to be caught. But the bronjun... the Jarl... was very proud of his pet. Paak!
They say he Shouted it into submission in single combat atop Mount Anthor and brought it back to Whiterun.
I used to visit him from time to time. Nearly crazed by loneliness and captivity. Tiiraz sivaas. He did not even remember his own name.
Yes. This was ages ago, you understand. There were more of us then. Before the bruniikke - the Akaviri - came and killed all my zeymah.
Keep away. If I am harmed, people will come looking.
I have nothing to say to you. Now move along, or I'll order my guards to attack.
Not the response I was hoping for, but suit yourself.
Can't say I blame you. I'll find someone to take care of it.
Now Loreius. Loreius has learned the meaning of ugly.
Someone lied. Someone told the guard poor Cicero did something he did not. We were detained, delayed! The Night Mother kept from her new home!
But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Hmmm? No. No... Of course not. Because then Cicero would get angry, and that would be... ugly.
Of course. Skyrim has always been part of the Empire.
That doesn't mean I support everything the Empire's been doing lately, but Nords have never been fair-weather friends.
Oh! Well in that case, lead on. I'm right behind you.
On this glorious day, we honor everyone! Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha! Yes, yes indeed! Hail the Imperial Legion! Hail the Stormcloaks! Hail Solitude and the Eight Divines!
Only the best in all of Riften! I own Riften Fishery.
Too bad I haven't had the same success helping this city shed its poverty. Nivenor thinks I'm wasting my time trying, but I disagree.
Started out with a single fishing pole and now I have an entire building and two boats to my name. Not bad for a middle-aged Nord, eh?
Perhaps we should take a look inside these coffins...
Now please do be careful. Who knows what we're going to find.
The Psijics have no connection to these ruins. And no one's seen any of their order in a long time.
Perhaps you'd be willing to assist me in that regard?
I need to return to the source of the problem, to Nightcaller Temple.
Probably got drunk and fell into the lake. Who cares.
If they do, we'll send them crying back to their boss again.
No idea. Maybe he got tired of getting stung by these damn bees.
Keep your eyes open, they'll try to hit us again... I just know it.
So why did he sell this place? I mean look at it. This is how to live.
Agh... so bored! Only one fight in the last few weeks? This is gonna' drive me crazy.
Have you seen Refnir? I told him to check out the well drain, but he never reported back.
Sure. Then you wake up in the morning with your purse empty and your gear stolen. No thanks.
I can't believe how lucky we got landing this job. It's a far cry from working for the Stormcloaks.
You're telling me. Playing nursemaid to a bunch of bees and drinking mead all day beats dying on some battlefield.
Did you get a look at that thief that they sent to break into the place? What I wouldn't give for a night with her.
Aringoth said as soon as the deed goes through, we're done here. Then we'll head south and look for more work. Deal?
Remember, we have proof and all he's got is his word.
Then we show them Gallus's journal and hope for the best.
See if you can find anything in the burned out house.
I'll pay you to figure it, whether or not he's guilty.
Should you prove him guilty or innocent, I will reward you.
Can't prove it. But I could use your help, being unbiased and all.
On rumor and gossip? No. But you, a stranger, might find the truth for us.
Aye. Our Jarl would sure like to know if he did though. Might even pay to find out.
Sift through the ashes that others are too fearful to touch. See what they tell you.
See to that, and I'll tell you what you want to know.
I have dishonored my brothers by being captured, and so they have left me here.
My life with the Alik'r is over now, but I have no wish to die in this gods-forsaken land. If I can be released from prison, I may start over.
She is the bearer of love and the patron of marriage.
Mara is the handmaiden of Kyne, the Goddess of the Storm and the Mother of Men.
If you wish to make a donation to her Benevolence, speak to Maramal and ensure your true love will endure for all eternity.
Skyrim is filled with all manner of dangerous beasts.
Wolves, trolls, mammoths and giants would all like to make a meal of us.
But the dragons are the most fearsome. Lucky for us, they don't seem to hunt along the roads.
So Sibbi finally got the nerve to bare his teeth, eh?
Just don't expect us to at your back when Maven has your head on the executioner's block.
Guess I should have known. Maven and Sibbi have been at odds ever since she had him tossed into jail.
Look, this sounds like a family matter and I don't want the Guild in the middle of it. You do what you want.
As far as the Guild's concerned this is between Sibbi and Maven, so we're going to officially stay out of it.
Look, if I were you, I'd proceed carefully. Crossin' Maven is one of the first things you learn not to do when you're down here.
Speak with Ulfric, he's expecting word from Whiterun.
We're taking the city. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!
We're attacking Riften. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!
We're taking the capital. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move it!
We're taking Falkreath. Get over there with the others. Fight well or die well.
We're liberating Morthal. Join the brothers gathering for the attack. Talos be with you.
We're mounting our final attack on Windhelm. You're needed on the front line. Get a move on soldier!
We're taking Dawnstar. Get down there and join the rest of the men gathering for the attack. Now soldier!
The Stormcloaks are here. In force. Get down to the front line. This is it. We must hold the city. Move it!
We're taking Winterhold. Get over there and join the rest of the men gathering for the attack. Now soldier!
We're taking the city. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.
We're taking Whiterun. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.
We're taking the capital. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.
We're ready to launch our attack on Solitude. But the Emperor's visiting! We can't risk attacking now. So we'll bide our time.
We're mounting our attack on Markarth. Get over there and join the brothers gathering for the attack. This is it now! Talos be with you.
We're ready to launch our attack on Solitude. But the Emperor's cousin is getting married! We can't risk attacking now. So we'll bide our time.
We're mounting our final attack on Solitude. Get over there and join the rest of the army. They'll be launching the attack soon. Talos be with you!
The Imperials are here. All lined up pretty-like in their shiny armor. We'll put a few dents in those bastards before we give up the city. Move it!
Sure, but I bet he can't hold his mead as well as me!
Right you are! Guess I'll keep training you... for now.
Yeah, but can he hammer the anvil for 8 hours straight?
Come on, Heimvar. My son could stoke the forge better than you do!
Give him time. In a couple years, he'll be the age you were when you started!
You're making progress, Heimvar. But my boy could still work the bellows better than you do!
The Thalmor? Do you have any idea what you're asking?
I can only imagine the headaches this is going to cause...
I'm sorry, that's just not possible. It would cause far too many problems.
Here, take this. Assuming they even honor it, you should be able to get your prisoner out.
They call themselves the [QUOTE]Blood Horkers.[QUOTE]
They've been around as long as I can remember, but only recently focused on our ships.
A dastardly group, but they're more than simple brigands. Shrewd. Clever. Not to be trifled with.
This is how you repay our trust? Paarthurnax's trust?
A mindless vendetta urged on you by a cabal of Akaviri barbarians!
Begone, before even my philosophy is tested beyond the breaking point. We are men of peace, and you are not.
His noble spirit... the wisdom of ages... his deep understanding of our existence... all gone, and for what?
This is Markarth, traveler. Safest city in the Reach.
You here to see the Jarl? No sudden moves, understand?
Whole dwarven city underneath the keep. Nchuand-Zel. Best steer clear if you don't want a Steam Centurion carving you up.
We believe the place in our vision to be Karthwasten.
Now move quickly. The girl must be brought to the temple as soon as possible.
We have to move. We'll talk more once we see the sky.
It's a little gift from the dwarves. Who knew they would end up helping our cause?
What do you want? You have no business being in here.
What is this? The elf playing at treachery? Shocking.
As if I would write this dribble. How about we play a bit of turnabout with Faendal?
Here. I had to use simple words, but this letter should convince Camilla it's from him.
What of it? It's our Inn, and they cause him no harm.
I believe he was suggesting their presence causes him harm.
Well, then he's welcome to eat and drink at home, isn't he?
I understand Korir's been complaining about our customers again.
Where did you learn of a Shout used to defeat Alduin?
Where did you learn of that? Who have you been talking to?
Yes, and I'm working on it, but I'm also trying to...
When I ask you for something, I expect it to get done.
Master, I have a question about infusions of arrowroot.
Yes, master. I'm sorry, I'll get back to those notes straight away.
Yes, master, I know. I just want to keep up my own projects as well.
Damn it, child, didn't I tell you to gather my notes on sub-material properties?
You can waste your own time, not mine. An apprentice obeys his master. A good one does, at least.
Yes. My older brother. He was a bit of a fop, really.
Yes. My older brother and the person you probably want to be speaking to right now.
And truth be told, since Torygg's death, he had no real power in court. But still... He didn't deserve to die.
But really, since Torygg's death, Falk Firebeard wields the true power of the Jarl's court. My brother is nothing more than a pompous little fop.
You could learn Dragonrend from those who created it.
Tiid krent. Time was... shattered here because of what the ancient Nords did to Alduin.
If you brought that Kel, that Elder Scroll back here... to the Tiid-Ahraan, the Time-Wound...
With the Elder Scroll that was used to break Time, you may be able to... cast yourself back. To the other end of the break.
You get me a heart, I get you some armor. Interested?
If you want some heavy armor, I might have a deal we could work out. I need a Daedra's Heart. Jarl wants me to cool his new sword in blood.
Depends on what you need. A light armor is good for travel. Less to carry. A heavy armor weighs you down, but no true warrior goes without it.
You kiddin'? My brother Dirge works in their hideout.
I used to run with them myself, but took a job with Maven after they started hittin' a rough patch.
If you want to get in on that action, find Brynjolf in the marketplace. I'm sure he could use someone like you.
You work hard, Daighre. Glad you have stayed with us.
I'm grateful, Skaggi. I'm sorry my daughter gives you so much trouble.
You. You must take the Lexicon. Free me of my burden.
You're too kind. Thank you. Be careful and stay safe.
Thank you, traveler. Be safe and don't forget to keep an eye on the sky.
Your loss, but if you change your mind, I'll be here.
A hard truth, that is. Let's drink to the fallen ones.
War may be good for business, but it's hard on families.
Ay, we can get that for ya. We just finished the timber for those catapults.
I got a new order in for shields. I'm gonna need some hardwood planks. None of that soft pine this time.
A sharp mind on you. We should find out for ourselves.
That is the kind of thing Kodlak used to say. And he was right. But still, I'd like to see for myself.
Ah well. I'll keep looking for someone. Thanks anyway.
Ah, at last. I've been anxiously awaiting your return.
Why are you here? Killing Gaius Maro is but the first step of your contract - you must also plant the incriminating letter on his body...
Ahh, going for the mysterious and brooding thing, hmm?
That may work for your targets, but you'll find I'm not so easily impressed.
And my Aunt wouldn't have to worry about her daughter.
And take this. A gift from the Jarl's personal stores.
I hereby grant you permission to purchase property in my city. Talk to my steward if you're interested.
Arrogant, eh? Play it however you want, but listen up.
When you come to your senses, find me there and we'll discuss your future.
At least the Nords don't shirk their responsibilities.
That was three days. I'm thinking more like three weeks.
Three weeks? You're mad! You can't keep the stand closed for that long!
I've been thinking of hunting out beyond the boundaries of Whiterun hold.
Congratulations, brother. You've been living in Skyrim so long, you've become a Nord.
Again? You just had an [QUOTE]extended hunt[QUOTE] last month. To the Pine Forest, wasn't it.
Why not? Business has been terrible. Most folk would rather hunt their own meat than buy ours.
Nonsense. That's just an excuse for you to avoid working, and [QUOTE]commune with the greenwood like our fathers of old[QUOTE] and blah blah.
Azura? Gods, it's all finally coming back to haunt me.
You're working with the Daedra? Right. Now tell me the one about the Argonian Maid and the lusty baron.
But I had to know if the rumors about you were true...
I'll explain what I want when I want, got it? You'd already be dead if I didn't like the look of you when you walked in here.
But it never hurts to be a little suspicious, does it?
That what he's really doing is spying for the Thalmor, trying to feed them information. Whether it's true, I can't say.
Between the two of us, there are rumors about him. That this [QUOTE]advisor[QUOTE] position he has is a sham, an excuse.
Certainly! Glad to see you have the task well at hand.
Doesn't matter. I'm sure he's long gone by now anyway.
Fair enough. But are you willing to die for your home?
For Ulfric? Oh, nothing official. Known him for years.
He seems to value my thoughts, and I'm grateful for that.
I don't really have a mind for war, and I think he likes having an untrained opinion from time to time.
Gallus trusted her too much and let her get too close.
She was a stubborn Dunmer... always had to do everything her way.
But she was also the best... bringing in more coin a month than some thieves heist in a year.
Go talk to the Greybeards, see what they can tell you.
If you can Shout, you need to go see the Greybeards. They'll know what to do.
I know more than most. I trained with the Greybeards at High Hrothgar when I was a boy.
Most people would need to train for years before they could even attempt a single Shout.
If you think you might be able to do that kind of thing, the Legion could certainly use your help.
The Dragonborn is different - you have an inborn ability to Shout, the same way dragons are said to.
But only the Greybeards study the Way of the Voice any more. If you can Shout... you need to talk to them.
Old Nord folk tales always talk about Shouting their enemies to pieces. I always thought it was just a myth.
In the old tales, Nord heroes would use the power of their Voice to Shout down the gates of cities and strike down their enemies.
The Way of the Voice is an ancient, spiritual form of magic in which you project your vital essence into a [QUOTE]thu'um[QUOTE] or Shout.
Well, I only know what I've heard in the old tales. Shouting is an ancient form of magic - the use of one's voice to project their power.
Good to see you in my museum again. I owe you my life.
The museum is doing well. I haven't told anyone about the... incident with the Razor.
I never thought all I would want is peace and quiet, but I think our little adventure scared me straight.
Good, these will make wonderful settings for my rings.
Good. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for your return.
Have you prepared the stables like I suggested, Shadr?
Good. You could be our first line of defense since you live outside the city walls, so we're depending on you.
Yes, Lady Mjoll. If Riften gets attacked, we'll retreat inside the city gates and bar the door just like you said.
I can't believe you did that. You people are monsters!
Here, take your coin and tell Brynjolf to leave us alone.
You demand payment for protection and you can't even protect yourselves.
I don't need to know if it's fresh from this distance.
That's disgusting, get that rotting carcass away from me!
You there, pretty lady. You need some fresh meat for your family? Just look at the blood coming from this cut....
What's wrong? You have to look at the blood closely to see the quality of the meat. How else will you know it's fresh?
I have given my answer. Go and reconsider your course.
The decision whether or not to help you is not mine to make.
Forgive me. I was... intemperate. I allowed my emotions to cloud my judgment. Master Einarth reminded me of my duty.
So the Blades have survived yet another disaster of their own making, and continue to meddle in things they do not understand.
I may be dark elf by birth, but I was raised Argonian.
I hope one day to find out what happened to me... how I ended up like that.
Through reasons I'm still trying to discover, I ended up orphaned then taken in by a kindly Argonian family in Black Marsh.
I need some more supplies. Can you help out with that?
I think you'll find this payment to be more than fair.
I want you to explain to them the error of their ways.
They owe our organization some serious coin and they've decided not to pay.
I would be honored for you to accompany me, Harbinger.
I... I think I need to be done talking for the moment.
Then like Roggvir, you have a Nord's heart. It's hard for many of the people here to understand.
I'm always trying to find more of Shalidor's writings.
As a matter of fact, there are. Have you ever heard of Shalidor?
Immensely powerful mage, back in the First Era. Had an understanding of magic few have ever matched.
He holed himself up in Labyrinthian, and devoted all of his time to research and study. Wrote more than you would imagine possible.
Since then, his writings have been scattered all over Skyrim, but are little use to anyone who can't translate them. I'm one of the few who can.
I'm sorry, I was under the impression I was in charge.
You're leading and I'm following. Does that seem clear to you?
If that's what she wants, then that's what she'll get.
If you think there's anything you can do, be my guest.
Is it that obvious? Sigh. I've got my hands full here.
Between the farm chores, cultivating my supply of nirnroot and keeping a tight rein on my sister Aduri, there's little time for rest.
Leave me to my work. Unless you plan to stay and help?
My Jarl, I have concerns about the safety of Dawnstar.
Safety? Don't I have you to handle the town's safety? What is this about, Jod?
I won't have you rob our soldiers of their chance to drive out the Empire. I'm done discussing this, Jod.
You keep pledging more and more of our guard to the frontlines. The way this is going, we won't be able to defend our own borders.
Glory is meaningless if they have no home to return to. I urge you to lower our commitments to the front until I'm sure we're safe.
Nonsense. The best place for our men is driving the Imperials back. I will ensure that men from Dawnstar get every opportunity for glory.
No. I cannot teach it to you because I do not know it.
Now, since our transaction is done, I'll be on my way.
Look, that's all I know. I never promised you I'd have all the answers.
Oh thank goodness! I wasn't sure where else to turn...
Only then will I take my rightful place as High Queen.
It seems I will never take my rightful place as High Queen.
Ulfric Stormcloak is victorious, and the Jarls have fallen in line.
No. Although it's true my husband Torygg was the High King and I am his widow, I am in no position to claim such a title.
This land is riven by war, and her people suffer for it. The Stormcloaks are a blight on Skyrim, and like any blight... must be purged.
Not yet, no. Although it is true my husband Torygg was the High King, and I am his widow... now is not the time to lay claim to such a title.
Ooohh.... how decadent. I never would have guessed it.
Please. I don't want to talk about it. All that blood.
If you want answers, ask at the inn. She told me she was staying there.
Rather not talk. I have to head back to Cyrodiil soon.
Riften and thieves means trouble. Just leave it alone.
One night Ranmir was in here like always, drinking himself to death.
When I told him there was no more Honningbrew, that he'd drank it all, he got angry.
Dagur never heard any of this, and I chose to keep it to myself. I'm only telling you so you don't get into trouble.
He ranted at me, how I didn't know what he's been through, how Isabelle broke his heart when she ran off with some thief named Vex...
He said he'd even gone to Riften to try and find the bastard. I think maybe he was hoping they'd just kill him, and that'd be the end of it.
Right now I've got a book that I think you might like.
First off, let's keep this between us. I picked these up from the graves in town so don't go blabbing about it to Kust.
You have to understand, Gentle Repose is a fallow festering place I should have left a long time ago. This is one of the few ways I make any money.
She did, did she? She's going to get a sit down later.
She influences our luck and in return demands payment.
Nocturnal isn't one for worship and reverence. There are no priests and no sermons, no services and no alms.
So Delphine keeps up the fight, after all these years.
You'd better come in and tell me how you found me and what you want.
Delphine? How do you ... ? This is just a trick to get me to open the door, eh? I told you to go away!
So we scrounge whatever we can from around the tundra.
Now we can't cut them, and can't afford to buy another mill somewhere else.
We got the mill up and running before we found out that the big stand of trees on the hill was sacred.
Sorry... I usually have a nose for this kind of thing.
Never mind then, lad. If you change your mind, come find me.
Never mind then, lass. If you change your mind, come find me.
Spare a coin for a fellow Nord who's down on his luck?
Never you mind, then. I'll find a more charitable soul.
So you can spend it on drinks at the Bannered Mare? If it's food you need, ask for that instead.
Speak with General Tullius. He'll administer the oath.
But before we go any further, it's time for you to officially join the Legion.
What's the matter, soldier? I gave you an order. I want that fort, and I want it now. Move it!
Welcome back, soldier. I'm glad you made it in one piece. I'll send men to garrison the fort right away. You did well. I'm impressed.
That may be so. This is Vilkas. He will test your arm.
That's a real shame. You would've fit the bill nicely.
The fever's down a bit, an' I can almost see straight.
I still can't hold nothin' down, but it's better than yesterday.
My joints ache, I can't eat nothin' and my head feels like a furnace. I've seen better days.
The Legion could sure use someone like you. Good luck.
If I make it back to Solitude, I'll put in a good word for you with General Tullius.
Their aim could be steadier, but they're battle ready.
They haven't allowed necromancy for hundreds of years!
Necromancy? I am a member of the College of Winterhold, in good standing!
Think you can mess with an Orc of the Reach? Let's go.
Wait. You win. I'll ease off on the beatings, just leave me alone.
Calm down there, friend. I'll pay! Tell Haran that she'll have her gold.
All right, all right. Have it your way. Tell Octieve to forget about the debt.
What? No. All right. I won't worry about the coin anymore, just stop giving me that look.
Whoa. Hey there. I didn't mean to make you upset. On my honor, Carlotta won't have to worry about me again.
Easy. Maybe I was being too harsh on them. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, they will be paid fairly. You have my word.
Very well. Come for me, then. Come and let's end this!
Then come for me, [QUOTE]son of Skyrim.[QUOTE] Come for me!
Then come for me, [QUOTE]daughter of Skyrim.[QUOTE] Come for me!
We hurt them in the past, and they have long memories.
When I was young, our leaders became obsessed with the Thalmor threat.
They believed that if and when we found a Dragonborn, we would need to protect her against the Thalmor.
They believed that if and when we found a Dragonborn, we would need to protect him against the Thalmor.
We'll meet back up at the Sanctuary! I'll be fine. Go!
What are you doing here? What've you done with Gavros?
Where I belong is back aboard my ship, on the Abecean.
You've no hope of defeating me, pup. Don't bother. Why not broker a bargain, instead?
Without them at our backs, we'd be in serious trouble.
Yes, and just like weeds, they're nothin' but trouble.
Those little girls of yours are growing like weeds, Lemkil.
You call yourself a wizard? I challenge you to a duel!
You have committed a breach, and must pay the penalty.
You're not one of my workers. What are you doing here?
A solid gold ornament, in the shape of a dragon's claw.
An ornament, solid gold. In the shape of a dragon's claw.
Yes, we did have a bit of a... break-in. But we still have plenty to sell. Robbers were only after one thing.
You mean before he died? We had a break in. Thieves didn't touch anything on the shelves, or any coin, just one thing.
Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Are you new here?
Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Good to see you made it up here.
Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Wait... I remember you. So the old man thinks you've got some heart, I guess.
Ah, pardon me, friend. I didn't see you standing there.
Allow me to introduce myself: Razelan. Imports and exports, by trade. Observer of human nature, by avocation.
Ah, you're from the College? I've been waiting for you.
Oh yes, that. Here you go. I hope this can be ready soon.
Oh, good. I've been waiting for you. Here you go, it's all ready.
Now, Sergius knows what I want. I'm hoping he can get it done quickly.
It's about time someone arrived. Here, make sure this is handled properly.
Please make sure this arrives in a timely manner. And don't scratch it up.
Yes, yes. Let's keep our voices down, all right? Just make sure this gets there.
Yes, yes I did. I've already sent instructions, you just need to make sure this arrives in one piece.
All right. Head to the pit when you think you're ready.
Well aren't you in luck. He's the next piece of gutter scum on the docket. Between you and me, I hope you cleave his arrogant head open.
Arkay keeps the cycle. He watches us in life and death.
You've returned. What happened in the Hall of the Dead?
Tread lightly in the Hall. We don't know what's in there.
If it's about the Hall of the Dead, no, you can't go in there.
Let us sleep, sweet Arkay, by your side. Let no harm come to us.
Find out what's happening in the Hall of the Dead. Arkay will watch over you.
Arkay will guard our eternal rest. His servants shall protect the dead from harm.
Protect us, Arkay, from the foul and unclean who seek to disturb the dead's rest.
Black Briar Mead? What are you trying to do? Poison me?
Blast. Well, I'll check my sources and speak to Mercer.
But for now, you're off to speak to Maven Black-Briar. She asked for you by name.
Bring it to me, and we'll talk about Goldenglow Estate.
I have a buyer looking for a case of Firebrand Wine. There just so happens to be a single case in the Blue Palace.
But first... find my husband. Make sure he's all right.
I want you to find that miserable little fool and end his life!
Let me know the minute you find something. I've got to see to Veezara, and calm everyone down.
Search Cicero's room. Maybe there's something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone.
After the attack, Arnbjorn flew into a rage. When Cicero left... Arnbjorn went after him. They disappeared into the wild.
Captain Lonely-Gale, it's always a pleasure to see you.
If that business proposition includes smuggling, forget it.
A pleasure to see you as well, Niranye. What can I do for you?
In fact, I'm glad you're here. There's something I'd like to ask you.
I was wondering if you still had many associates in the shipping profession.
The sailors I know are plenty good at finding trouble without any help from you.
You're such a wet blanket, captain. Can't a girl have a little fun from time to time?
I have a business proposition for any sailors who might be looking to make a few extra septims.
Does this mean... is it done? Is Alduin truly defeated?
Don't be late, you don't want to miss your own wedding!
Your wedding will be held tomorrow, from dawn until dusk.
You wish to be married? It's good to see love blossoming, even during these difficult times.
Don't get involved in that nonsense. Just want to work.
You don't like the Nords? Fine. But pledging your whole life to killing them? That's just dumb.
Every other day, seems one of the laborers runs off in the hills saying he'll join the Forsworn.
We've lost a lot of good people to that damn crusade. Drive out the Nords, they say. Well, the Nord ain't driven out.
Ever tried making your own? It's... not easy. Trust me.
A lifetime of study, you might say. The best comes from Riften, but I haven't been there in years.
Fine work. Here's your pay. Don't spend it all on mead.
Follow me. I think I can convince the tree to help us.
Go ahead. Whatever you want to know. Nothing held back.
Good job. I knew you'd come back with something for me.
Excellent work. I knew you'd bring back something useful.
Good, and take this little message back to your bosses.
I'm not paying any of you a single septim... ever! Now get out of my inn!
Hard to say. The weather's taken a bit of a turn, here.
Haldyn's been known to obscure his hideaways with magic.
If we take care of him, the way should be clear to properly assault the island.
He lives in seclusion on the very peak of the mountain.
He speaks to us only rarely, and never to outsiders. Being allowed to see him is a great privilege.
I am at the Arch-Mage's disposal if he requires advice.
I am an advisor to the Arch-Mage. The Thalmor wish to promote relations with your College.
I believe Galmar gave you something to do. So go do it.
Speak with Galmar. You'll be going on a little errand with him.
You're alive! I'm impressed! Galmar had his doubts about you, but I knew you'd pull through. You should speak with him. He's going to need your help.
I call forth that power! Accept the soul that we offer!
As in death there is new life, in Oblivion there is a beginning for that which has ended.
I call upon Oblivion realms. The home of those who are not our ancestors. Answer my plea!
As the sun ends the night, end the darkness of this soul, return life to the creature you see before you!
I cannot teach you the Shout, because I do not know it.
I just wanted a little excitement. Something dangerous.
Because it was dull. Every day was the same boring routine; working at the winery, social visits with friends, parties with no one I cared about.
I need you to pitch in a little more around here, dear.
I help, I do the chores. What else would you have me do?
I know your sights are set beyond this town, but for now, while you're under our roof, I need you to pitch in a little more.
I should have guessed Ulfric would be mixed up in this.
I think I would, if it weren't for my son. And my wife.
You think Stormcloaks and Legionnaires are dangerous? Ha!
Oh, Sayma would have my hide if I even suggested I might step foot on a battlefield.
I think my voice is ready. I hope we've done this well.
I was beginning to lose faith that any help would come.
Eh... You see... I've been thinking about Faleen quite a bit. You know Faleen?
I'm bored, Benor. Nobody wants to have any fun with me.
If you leave that kinslayer Hroggar, I would be happy to keep your company.
You tempt me mightily, Alva. But I won't cuckhold another man, even on murderer like Hroggar.
Hroggar doesn't have to know if we sit together. Or drink together. I doubt he would even care.
I'm sorry for doubting you, friend. You have my thanks.
Anything, anything at all would be a start. Then we can figure out how to get to him.
I'm still waiting for those notes, if you can get them.
I've been noting a pattern to when the killings happen.
Let's see. From a Loredas of Last Seed until a Middas of Heartfire... it will happen soon. Very soon.
Keep watch in the Stone Quarter tomorrow night. That's almost certainly where the killer will strike next.
Now that we know they're tied in to some sort of necromantic ritual, I think I know when the next might occur.
If only my mother would let me, I would make her proud.
Now, thanks to my mother's generosity, this city is making its mark.
The Black-Briars have been instrumental in keeping Riften on the map.
I've tried everything I can to protect Riften's citizens from her family, but to no avail.
Hmph. My family. All that wealth and they squander it on foolish ventures and political schemes.
Help us, you end up rich. Cross us and you'll end up a memory. Is that enough information for you?
Maven Black-Briar, the matriarch of the family, represents everything that's wrong with this city.
When speaking of the Black-Briars, only one thought should spring to mind. We are not to be trifled with.
I was meant for so much more than all of this... I wish to pledge my life and ply my talents in darker circles.
Maven Black-Briar is the owner of the largest and most profitable business in all Skyrim, the Black-Briar Meadery.
She's bribed countless officials, has friends back in the Imperial City and freely associates with the Thieves Guild.
We're pleased to have her in Riften. She brings stability, opportunities for employment and strategic value to our city.
Before the meadery was opened almost fifty years ago, this town was nothing... a simple waypoint for those journeying on to Morrowind.
Just get away from me. We've got nothing left to steal.
I bet the wedding was amazing... and we missed the whole thing.
Leave me alone. I just want to find my way out of this accursed province.
Look at the sky. Be a terrible day tomorrow. I know it.
Yes it can. I haven't been wrong in 50 years, and I won't be wrong tomorrow.
Oh, Rogatus! Maybe tomorrow will be pleasant for once, hmm? It can't be terrible every day!
Magic is seen as something for elves, and weaker races.
Magic is shunned by most. If it can't be swung over your head and used to crack skulls, most Nords want nothing to do with it.
Maybe you could help find it, I just know it's in here.
Mercer took everything. Even all of our plans are gone.
Better question would be [QUOTE]what did he leave.[QUOTE]
My father taught me an important lesson many years ago.
He said [QUOTE]Gwilin, you have the whole world before you. Go out and experience it... be whatever you want to be.[QUOTE]
So I took his advice, and here I am. This life might not look like much to you, but I'm content, and isn't that all that matters?
No matter how much the Stormcloaks may wish it were so.
It's the peace treaty that ended the war with the Elves of the Aldmeri Dominion.
The Dominion recognized the heresy of proclaiming Talos a god. Talos was a great man, and a great Emperor... but that does not make him a god.
No, nor do I expect to. Would be too dangerous for now.
It's enough for me to know that they're out there somewhere, and together again.
It's enough for me to know that he's out there somewhere, and not locked up like an animal in a cage.
None of 'em's older than nine, and the youngest is six.
Now, the horse I got for sale is seven years old, but in fine health. She's got a lot of spirit, that one.
We've taken to calling her Queen Alfsigr, or just Allie for short. I expect you can name her anything you like once she's yours.
Oh! Well if you change your mind, come back and see me.
Perhaps not the brightest spot in Skyrim's history, eh?
That way it was always ready for the next inevitable victim.
Not much, I'm afraid. It was named Kahvozein's Fang after the dragon worshipped by this particular sect of the cult.
They were said to be quite fond of ritual sacrifices. So fond, in fact, that the high priest spent a great deal of time sharpening the dagger.
Please, just go check it out. You'll be saving my life.
If the damn Blades are no match for the Thalmor, what chance do I have?
No, you can't ever be too paranoid where the Thalmor is concerned. Look what happened to the Blades. The Blades!
Release me, and I'll share a bit of my wealth with you.
Those kids are dead anyway. Killing me won't bring them back. I, on the other hand, have done quite a bit with my time on Mundus.
So it's true. The Greybeards really were summoning you.
Suit yourself. If you change your mind, I'll be around.
Thank you for your help.  Did you see my family inside?
That amount should allow me to readily acquire a drink.
The Greybeards? What do those old hermits want with me?
The last wheat shipment fetched a fine price at market.
Well done! I don't know where I'd be without you, my old friend.
It pleases me to know that I can still be of use even in the twilight of my life.
There's not enough money in the world to replace Gleda.
Fine, but I'll still be missing my Gleda. Doubt I'll ever have a prize winning goat again.
Most of what you said was gibberish but you left a note. The only bit I could read was [QUOTE]after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.[QUOTE]
This should shake the loyalty of the dov who serve him.
Alduin always was pahlok - arrogant in his power. Uznahgar paar. He took domination as his birthright.
Ni liivrah hin moro. True, this is not the final krongrah - victory. But not even the heroes of old were able to defeat Alduin in open battle.
We both agree it's best to keep these matters in house.
I have a long-standing arrangement with the Dark Brotherhood. If I need someone in the Guild taken care of, we do it ourselves.
We should keep moving. Still the draugr to worry about.
Now let's move. I think that was the last of the Silver Hand, but still plenty of draugr for the both of us.
Well, I suppose I could use a hand with something, yes.
Faralda's working on something, and I want to know what it is.
I want her notes. You think you could get them for me, without her knowing?
Well, offer still stands if you ever want to have a go.
I don't blame you. If I were in your shoes, I'd chicken out too.
Wonderful, just wonderful! I knew I could count on you!
But, ahh... It's effective. Three times, and the crystal should be ready for the next step. Isn't this exciting?
I suspect it may be due to the nature of the soul gem versus the crystals this was intended for. Destroys the equipment in the process.
Now this spell is not for defending yourself, but it's just right for heating the Convector. At least three seconds' burn is necessary.
Just place the soul gem inside, and heat the Convector. At least three seconds. You'll almost certainly need to find multiple Convectors.
Yeah, we'll get the valuables out of there, no problem!
Oh, we'll make sure it's emptied out by morning. You can trust us!
Big shipment coming in later tonight. I need you three working late.
Yes. The Skull has been destroyed and Dawnstar is safe.
You can't be too careful. Thalmor spies are everywhere.
You're a traveller, correct? Have you been to Whiterun?
Your mother seems to have taken to her seat quite well.
Yes, she's been grooming herself for this for quite a long time.
Let's just say my mother knows which pockets to line and keep it at that.
It's surprising the Council is allowing a Nord rule Riften under the Imperial flag. That can't be their first choice.
[QUOTE]The bloodiest beef in the Reach![QUOTE] Ha ha ha.
Ah, yes. The courier. I guess you know my secret ingredient for that spiced beef, now.
You buy a war dog from me? There's a reason why my hounds are so eager to bite into people.
That's right. You're the sellsword. Thank you again. It's so nice to have help with my husband gone. Shame what happened to him.
One of my customers? Did you know I inherited the store from my late husband? Shame what happened to him. He had such good taste.
A bit of warming wine, Illdi. You know you can't resist.
Not fair. You're well aware I can't seem to get warm here.
Do you know I look forward to Burning of King Olaf each year just because of the fire?
A monster? No. I'm just a servant. To my king, Madanach.
I get his messages, and I hand out his orders without question.
When the uprising fell at the hands of the Nords, they threw him in the mines. I don't know how, but he lives.
Aela will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp.
Farkas will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp.
Ah, yes. Thank you. I'll get to work on this right away.
I'll add it to the list of things I need to take care of. Thank you.
All right, but hurry. Who knows if Azura is watching us?
An Elder Scroll? That's not going to be easy to come by.
Esbern's your man for that kind of thing. He may be able to at least point you in the right direction.
As you may know Talos worship is outlawed in the Empire.
Yes, when we buried my husband I wasn't able to make an offering to Talos.
When we buried my husband I made offerings to all the gods... except Talos.
Falk told me what you did for us at Wolfskull cave. He says you're someone we can trust.
I would like you to take an item of his, a warhorn handed down from his father, and place it at a Shrine of Talos.
I was hoping you would to take something of his, a warhorn handed down from his father, and place it at a Shrine of Talos.
Aye, we used to be fast friends, though it was long ago.
When the troubles began, he took the Empire's side. We haven't spoken much since then.
But then Olfrid got rich an' decided he an his kin were too good for us simple, backwards Nord folk.
We were two of the city's oldest an' most-respected clans, an' we could trace our histories all the way back to Ysgramor's companions.
Bandits attacked and ransacked my cart. Can you help me?
But I digress. Here, take these to your, um... superior.
Oh, wonderful. You don't know how happy I am to hear you say that.
So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. It's as if the very stars have finally aligned.
But I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
You should look into joining. They could use every hand they can get.
There's still Imperial camps to be cleaned up, as you know. And that takes arms and armor.
By Ysmir, are you thick, or just too new to know better?
Don't reckon they can use you. But stranger things have happened.
By Ysmir's beard, I ain't one for humor. You know who the Companions are. So quit your asking.
The Companions are the oldest, most honored band of warriors in Skyrim. Whiterun was built around their hall, Jorrvaskr.
Did you have any luck tracking own some more pitchforks?
I'll be sure to stress your urgency. It seems like every farmer in Skyrim is short on supplies these days.
Tell him I'll pay double the normal price. We've been getting by with one broken pitchfork, but it's falling apart.
Revyn put the word out to his suppliers but with the war on, tools are scarce. Both sides have been snapping them up.
Did you tell him you were Dragonborn? I didn't think so.
Lorkhan's eyes, do I have to do everything myself? Get back to Riften before the Thalmor find him!
So what are you doing here? Lorkhan's eyes, you can't let the Thalmor get to him first! Get back to Riften!
Do you know Dragonsreach? The Jarl of Whiterun's palace?
Its name is no accident. The palace was originally built to hold a captive dragon.
Follow me. Master Borri will test your Whirlwind Sprint.
We will do your next test in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.
Master Borri will teach you the first Word of a new Shout. Attend to him.
Stand next to me, and prepare your Whirlwind Sprint. Master Borri will give the signal.
Good job! I knew I gave the mission to the right person.
Good job! Ulfric was right about you. I'm glad to have you with us!
Good. They'll think twice before crossing us while their command structure is in disarray.
Excellent. I can move more soldiers through the area now that I know those scouts are dead.
We grow that much stronger with each son and daughter of Skyrim who joins us. Down with the Emperor!
Excellent. That's one less settlement in Imperial hands, and one more sign to all that our cause is true.
Good job! With those Imperial scouts out of the way, I can be more aggressive about where I send our men.
Thanks for taking care of that. I don't think that will be the last we see of that Orc. It's always good to gain allies.
Good job. The more citizens that join the fight against the rebels, the sooner they will see the futility of their rebellion.
I pray Talos overlooks our less than honorable approach. But he knows our purpose is just and true. I'm glad you made it out alive.
Good work. I'll send some men with a wagon to collect the prize. We can use the weapons here, and I'll pass on the coin to Solitude.
Good work. This was a double victory. We took a garrison away from the Stormcloaks and further proved the hollowness of their cause.
Well done! I'll send men with a wagon to collect our prize. We'll put the weapons to use here, and I'll send the coin back to Windhelm.
Thanks for dealing with that orc. Something tells me that's not the last time we'll see him. And, something tells me that might not be a bad thing.
Harbinger, I'd be honored if you joined me in my search.
Have a good rest. It's the big room with the double bed.
He is, by all accounts, the worst bard in all of Skyrim.
Apparently so many people sought his death, Astrid had to hold a lottery to determine the client.
Hmm? No, no. No! I'm too close now. Can't take the time.
Though... Perhaps there's another option. I, umm, I may require further assistance from you.
How the tree came to grow there is a bit of a mystery...
Some say that when Vvardenfell erupted, a piece was blown to the middle of Skyrim and from the crater grew the tree.
I've also heard that it was a spore that fell from an island floating in the sky, but that just sounds like nonsense.
All I know is that the sap makes you feel as healthy as a cave troll, but slow as a drunk horker. And that and it fetches good coin.
I don't suppose you're going to buy something this time?
If they do, promise you'll actually purchase something for once.
By Ysmir, I will. Gods know it's been too long since I tasted real meat.
Just browsin' today. If the gods be kind, someone will take mercy on me and spare a few septims.
I suppose it's tough for an old dog to learn new tricks.
Again? Didn't we teach you enough of a lesson the first time?
Anyway, you know the drill. You want to buy back in, and it'll cost you.
I thank you again, friend. You've given me my life back.
Our best hope now is to fall in with the ranks of the Stormcloaks.
I don't dare return to Whiterun. But my mother... She'll need some consolation.
Though shall mourn my brother, I thank you, friend. You've given me my life back.
I cannot stay. Not here, not in Whiterun. It likely won't be safe for Avulstein, either.
Tell her... tell her to suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. She'll understand.
But would you do me a favor? Tell my mother to suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. She'll know what it means.
I think you're on the wrong side in this war, my friend.
I was such a fool. How could I let him use me like that?
Stop moping about, girl. Tears won't change what you've done.
We all get used, dear. It's living with it that makes you a woman.
I'm just sayin' you should pick one to settle down with.
It's bad enough my brother is harping on me to pick one. Don't you start too.
You need to choose between those two boys. It ain't fair to Sven or Faendal to keep tuggin' on their heart strings like that.
If you wish to commune with Him, we'll need the incense.
Ah, no. Don't think you've got the stuff. Come back when you've seen a bit more in life, perhaps.
Not everyone has the stomach required to entreat my Lord. But Kesh likes you, friend. There is a way Peryite may speak to us who will take Him in.
Just coat your weapon with it. Then... you get the idea.
I planned to kill Alain myself, you know. Nilsine, too. But lost my nerve. I even brewed a special poison, Lotus Extract. Maybe you could use it?
Just take this damn thing. I never want to see it again.
If you want the mark that badly then go ahead and take it.
Take the mark if you want it. It's not worth all this hassle anyway.
If word gets around that I bedded her, they'll lose all respect for me at the meadery.
I don't want a bad reputation in Riften, but Haelga's out of control. She wanted to try it in the stables so I said yes.
Look, it was one night, okay? I think she slipped something in my drink. I haven't even been back to the Bunkhouse since.
Keep an eye on the sky. This is only going to get worse.
I'm not sure yet. I have a few ideas, but I'll need some time to pull things together...
Meet me back in Riverwood. If I'm not back when you get there, wait for me. I shouldn't be long.
Look here. There's something strange about this cabinet.
Make no mistake we consider you a protector of Solitude.
Take this payment - the Jarl would thank you but she very much wants to keep Potema's return quiet.
No. Not now. Not until you return to the path of wisdom.
Not my problem. You want through here, you pay. Or else.
Nothing like free labor to make operating costs cheaper.
Mallus is the best deal I've ever made. Lent him a bit of gold some time ago I knew he'd never be able to pay back.
Now it is in your hands. Let us work wonders together...
For hundreds of years it's been shut away from the world. Septimus was a useful tool for unleashing it.
Now you have my Oghma Infinium. It contains the knowledge of the ages as revealed to Xarses, my loyal servant.
Now some worry this wizard, Falion, will foul it all up.
That's what many here wanted. A quiet life in a quiet place, without the noise or the trouble of a city.
Now, if you're ready, I got another special job for you.
I've got another special request and they specifically asked for you.
We've got half of Skyrim back under our wing and the coin's startin' to flow.
In fact, I just got a special job request in. I haven't gotten anythin' like it in years.
I got one last special request of you. Finish this one and all of Skyrim's ours for the takin'.
Contacts are springin' up all over and I've got young footpads beatin' down the door to join up.
Well, it appears your actions are startin' to make waves out there. People are talkin' about the Guild again.
I don't know what your made of, but I've never seen anyone tackle this many jobs without endin' up dead or in jail.
Your makin' a name for yourself, that's for sure. But more important, you're makin' a name for the Guild. Keep it up.
Well, I never thought I'd see the Guild this way ever again. The place is growin' into what it used to be when Gallus was runnin' the show.
Of course they do, brother. You keep raising their rent.
I swear, those scheming elves charge us twice what anyone else would pay.
That clumsy maid at the palace spilled wine on my best suit. Sister, I believe it's time for a replacement.
I can commission one from the Radiant Raiment. It won't be cheap, but if you want the best, they're the only choice.
Of course. Let me see if we have another bottle of that.
I'll be waiting by the door for everyone to be distracted.
Oh, but the Dwemer had more than even Septimus expected.
This will take time to decryptify. Be on your way, and Septimus will find  you if he has further need.
Oh, isn't that a shame. And here I am in the Bloodworks.
Looks like you aren't such a sharp investigator after all.
Oh, wait... did you say Goldenglow Estate? My apologies.
I'm sorry to say I know very little about that... bee farm, was it?
Oh. Oh yes! Yes, the kindly stranger can certainly help!
Convince Loreius to fix my wheel! Do that, and poor Cicero will reward you. With coin! Gleamy, shiny coin!
Go to the farm - the Loreius Farm. Just over there, off the road. Talk to Loreius. He has tools! He can help me! But he won't! He refuses!
Or not. There's no guarantee with prophecy. Merely hope.
If we can just find out what this Dragonrend Shout is, you may have a chance.
If we can just find out what Shout the ancient Nords used, you may have a chance.
I still need some time to get used to the idea that there might be hope for us after all.
I never expected... well, suddenly here you are and now I'm too muddled to explain myself.
It's the prophecy, don't you see? Only a Dragonborn can stop Alduin and avert the end of the world!
But... I don't yet know how you can stop him. The prophecy doesn't say. But Alduin's Wall does. I hope.
Not yet, not yet. When we get to Riverwood... with Delphine... I'll tell you both then, when I've collected my thoughts.
Haven't you been paying attention to anything I've said? Only you can finally defeat Alduin and avert the end of the world!
Please help me look. He has a bright red beard and hair.
I've turned over every body, though, and I can't find him.
I'm searching for my Fenrig. He was marching with Gjukar's men, who they say were wiped out here.
Ralof's alive? I hope that's true. He's a damn good man.
But he hasn't returned yet, so I'll need to wait for his account. For now, speak with Galmar.
Take this. Every single coin I owe is there, I swear it.
I'll already told that buffoon I'm not paying you people a single coin!
Look, everything was all just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to tell Brynjolf to go jump off the pier. You'll tell him I said sorry, yes?
That might be so, but it will never stop me from trying.
Heard about that, did you? Yes, I went out for a pint or two. What of it?
Balgruuf, did you slip out again last night for a drink at the Bannered Mare?
These secret visits to the tavern will make you an easy target for an enemy assassin. You should have told me first.
Damn it, woman, I'm the Jarl of Whiterun! I won't apologize for talking to my people. You can't protect me every moment of the day.
That's true, but I'm in a new house now. A better house.
The nightmares are an echo of her presence as she feeds.
In any other circumstance, I'd agree with you. However, these aren't normal dreams.
The Daedric Lord Vaermina's voracious hunger for memories is responsible for these visions.
The way you and your mother forge weapons is impressive.
I served in the Legion. Perhaps I'll show you some of their technique one of these days.
It's simple Orc smithing practice, my chief. Nothing that hasn't been passed down for years.
There were many good battles, friend. I miss those days.
You didn't die. A battle you live through is a great honor.
You miss them? I don't know how many times I feared for my life.
Do you remember the Legion? Fighting the Thalmor in the Great War?
This is no test, new blood. This is a gift. Come inside.
Viarmo, the college really must take a stand on the war!
Aia, please be quiet. Viarmo and I are discussing matters of national politics.
Pantea, perhaps you should attend to your students, and leave the politics to me.
Aia, this is a delicate matter. Why don't you review your lessons and be silent for a while.
But I'm sure those Skyrim dogs would stand down if the keepers of the tales showed their patriotism!
Maybe if we stopped singing about their silly Nord heroes, the rebels would stop making such a fuss!
Viarmo, don't you think it's time that the Bards College officially declared support for the empire?
That is precisely why we remain neutral. Ours is to tell tales of empires, not to make or break them.
Now, now, our duty is to record the great tales of history, not to pick sides in them. Best to stay out of the warfare, I feel.
Lady Ateia, it is the official position of the college to remain neutral in all political affairs. We cannot risk our history by choosing sides.
We are honored to welcome a Dragonborn to High Hrothgar.
We will do our best to teach you how to use your gift in fulfillment of your destiny.
We warned you, but you just had to go and cause trouble.
Now we have to pin all these recent murders on you. Silence witnesses. Work. Work. Work.
We'll get him when he comes back around. Hold your fire.
We're going to make sure he doesn't get his hands on it.
The rest of my men are already assembling outside Korvanjund. I'll meet you there as soon as I finish up here.
Ulfric's right-hand man, Galmar Stonefist, has located what he believes is the final resting place of the Jagged Crown.
Well, if you change your mind, I'd still like your help.
Well... This seems to be in order. Very well, follow me.
What, did you suddenly grow a conscience? Suit yourself.
Whatever you have to say to the Jarl, you can say to me.
Who? You mean that woman who was attacked in the market?
Who? You mean that woman who was attacked in the market the other day?
Didn't know her. Guards dragged her body away. Last we'll hear of that.
Don't know her. Guards dragged that Forsworn's body away, though. Last we'll hear of that.
Yes, Sir. Although I'm not sure you'll be happy to know.
You deserve something for sniffing out that thief. Here.
Oh, really? So that Dark Elf took my ring. So typical of his kind.
I think the Jarl should hear about this. Maybe double his taxes. No, triple them. That should teach those people a lesson.
You seek that which all who wield magic seek. Knowledge.
You seek meaning, shelter in Knowledge. You will not find it.
You shall find this: Knowledge will corrupt. It will destroy. It will consume.
The Thalmor sought the same thing, and it shall lead to his end as it has so many others.
You're an outsider. You're dangerous-looking. You'll do.
Changed your mind? Ready to find out the truth about Markarth?
I'm sorry to drag you into Markarth's problems, but after that attack in the market, I'm running out of time.
A woman -- a foreigner in these lands. Redguard, like us.
We believe she may be hiding in Whiterun, but we're checking everywhere to be sure.
We are not welcome here in Whiterun, so we will be in Rorikstead if you learn anything.
She is likely not using her true name. We will pay for any information regarding her location.
We're looking for information about a woman -- a foreigner in these lands. She's a Redguard, like us.
After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again.
Only rumors. He used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down.
The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform.
Ah, the sneaky type, eh? I think we can fix you right up.
And danger ahead? Why that doesn't make any sense at all.
The Psijic Order? Are you quite sure about that? That's very odd.
And found my favor. That skin will serve you well, child.
Look more closely at it. My glories shall protect you from all this world's grievances.
And the Emperor will be forced to come clean up the mess.
Hmph. He had a trip to Skyrim planned for months, and canceled at the last minute. Much to his cousin's dismay.
All that will change with his cousin's murder. Everyone will think it was motivated by the conflict between the Imperial Legion and Stormcloaks.
Seems the Emperor realized his presence would necessitate a more direct role in the ongoing hostilities. A role he was, obviously, unwilling to take.
But at least we ended up with the damn crown. Now then...
Yes. Well, I didn't respond as quickly to the Legate's suggestion as perhaps I should have.
But first, tell me. Why's a cat want to fight for Skyrim?
But first, tell me. Why's an Elf want to fight for Skyrim?
But first, tell me. Why's an Orc want to fight for Skyrim?
But first, tell me. Why's a Breton want to fight for Skyrim?
But first, tell me. Why's a lizard want to fight for Skyrim?
But first, tell me. Why's a Redguard want to fight for Skyrim?
But first, tell me. Why's a foreigner want to fight for Skyrim?
But not all of them, because some of them are still here.
Without that axe, this whole land would be overrun still.
He came from the ancient homeland and killed all the elves.
What fragments we have are displayed in honor, but we always seek more.
Ysgramor was the hero who started the Companions. Wuuthrad was his weapon.
It was the blade hefted by Ysgramor when he returned to drive the elves out of the old Skyrim.
Wuuthrad is a relic of Ysgramor. Through that weapon, we trace our line straight to the first harbinger of makind in this land.
Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favor.
Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the Guild. They respected Karliah, and she deserves better.
Don't come back until every one of those things are dead.
Don't tell me you, of all people, are afraid of a battle.
Did you ever want to return to your stronghold? Go back to your family?
If you had to kill your own brother to be allowed back home, you'd think twice as well.
I would need to challenge the chief, and take his head, to return home. I'd rather stay here.
Every Nord should admire Ulfric. He fights for all of us.
In fact, he's the reason I chose to learn the smithing trade. I want to make weapons and armor for the great Stormcloak army.
Forgive me, but at what point does it become our concern?
Sir, the Imperial Legion has again requested assistance. What shall I tell them?
The same thing we've told them before, and the same thing we've told these Stormcloaks. It's not our concern.
Never. The College cannot become mired in local politics. What happens inside these walls is our worry. What happens outside is theirs.
Go on without me. I think I need to be alone for a while.
Grelka, how fast can you get your hands on some longbows?
I'll contact my man tonight and let you know what he says.
I don't care what it costs. I need four longbows and four score of arrows. Just make it happen.
I don't usually deal in weapons, but I know someone who can get them for me. You mind paying a little extra to get them fast?
Have you heard the story of how we came to be werewolves?
Have you met my husband? Well don't bother, he's a drunk.
Hin aar, orin nu. And yet here I am, still your prisoner.
I don't dare leave the house myself. So I need your help.
There's got to be something in that house of theirs. I just know it.
I know that Thorald's not dead. I just know it. The Imperials have him, and are keeping him somewhere. But I don't know where.
Those damned Battle-Borns... they know something. They're hiding it. They practically taunt us with it. They must have some sort of proof!
I don't talk to people who drink that Black Briar drench.
I have no idea what connection they'd have to this place.
They were a group of mages with a history that pre-dates the Empire. Very powerful, very secretive.
No one's seen them in well over a hundred years. They vanished, along with their sanctuary on the Isle of Artaeum.
I left his head on a pike at the wreckage of the caravan.
Never knew what became of the rest of the clan that survived. I suppose they moved on just like I did.
I see. So you don't remember fondling the statuary, then?
I think you need to calm down before I summon the guards.
I will send word to her family that she is in good hands.
You... you found her? I can't believe it. Let the girl come with me and we can begin her preparation.
You've truly earned the Blessing of Dibella, child. Prostrate yourself before her altar, and she will bestow her gift.
I wish I could say that it was, but it's not that simple.
But without Ulfric, the movement will wither and die. It's only a matter of time.
Many Stormcloaks will fight until they die, because they still believe they're fighting for Skyrim's freedom.
If you desire to fight me, then let's get this over with.
A man who feels no fear has no heart. I know fear. But it does not control me.
In these parts? Good luck. But don't come this way again.
Instead you've chosen to fall over your own foolish code.
It's clear you'll never see the Skeleton Key as I do... as an instrument of limitless wealth.
Keerava's stubborn, but she's got a soft spot for family.
She was the toughest of the bunch. Honestly, I'm amazed she didn't kick you out of the Bee and Barb herself.
Talk to Talen-Jei at the Bee and Barb and see if you can get something out of him. They're... well acquainted if you catch my meaning.
