Well, at least you didn't do anything stupid. Next time, when you're given a job, don't wander off or take your sweet time.
Are you daft? This isn't the Dark Brotherhood! We don't go around murdering anyone, ever. It just isn't how things are done.
I have to see her. Please, excuse me.
This is... more than I could have hoped for. Have you really done this for me?
I hope not. This is an important job.
I also want to know how they managed to get the place up and running so quickly.
I have a competitor called Honningbrew Meadery that I want to put out of business.
I suppose it would be. Good thinking.
I think someone has a crush on Illdi.
I think Illdi's better than Dean Pantea actually knows. She just gets intimidated when she's in class and can't sing.
I want you sellswords out of my mine.
Forsworn attacks are bad enough, but those sellswords are worse.
You should talk to Ainethach. He runs the mines. Used to anyway.
Oh, and when would that be, I wonder? When I sell my land to the Silver-Bloods?
Watch your tongue, native. We'll leave when we're sure there's no Forsworn here.
Ainethach needs to get rid of those Silver-Blood. Then maybe we can go back to work.
You should talk to Ainethach if you have business with the mine. Not that there's much these days.
The Silver-Bloods have made you a very generous offer for this pile of dirt. I suggest you take it.
I... I don't understand. Where is it?
I'll be the one asking the questions.
They have clashed with the Aldmeri Dominion before, and I have no intention of allowing that to happen here.
All you need to know is that the Psijic Order is a rogue organization, believing themselves to be above the law.
I'm going to make you sorry for this!
I'm not sure you belong here, friend.
Are you ready to for Serpentstone Island?
Hmm. Helgen, eh? Ulfric told us quite the story. If you made it through all that, you're likely worth something to me.
I've lost the way and wander blindly.
Hurry! Before Alduin your life devours bring word to Shor's hall of our hard fate!
Shor's hall, shimmering across the clouded vale. But quenched was hope by the shrouding mist - my mind is darkened.
I saw it fair when first I trod this long-sought path. The pain and fear vanished, dreamlike, and a vision beckoned -
If you really think you can manage...
But if you insist, I suppose I'll be on my way. Thank you, and good luck.
I mean, I'd hate to leave now and find out later you met some horrible fate at the hands of the Caller.
Impossible actually. Hmm, I wonder...
There may be a way to bypass the barrier, but I must check their library and confirm it can be done.
It's not luck, it's mead I'm cursing.
Keerava, Bersi Honey-Hand and Haelga.
Do this right, and I can promise you a permanent place in our organization.
Let me take a look at what you found.
At least you remembered one of the things I asked. Let me see that.
Let's find that Totem, Shield-Sister.
Let's find that Totem, Shield-Brother.
Hircine will bless us for finding his Totem.
The spirit of Skjor is with us on this errand. I feel him.
This is not the time for talk. Let's get to the Underforge and see what this can do.
May your road lead you to warm sands.
Until our next meeting, if such is fated.
I hope that you will come to do business with us again.
May the sun keep you warm even in this land of bitter cold.
The roads of Skyrim can be treacherous. If you must walk them, be wary.
I hope you will find a warmer welcome in your travels than we have found in ours.
Meantime, you best steer clear of me.
Seems to me they're a bunch of narrow-minded bigots, just like you.
Is that so? You ought to join the Stormcloaks, if you haven't already.
Miss Faida, may I ask you a question?
Of course, Julienne. What's on your mind?
What do you do when a customer can't afford to pay for a meal or a drink?
Since my customers are mostly local, I just knock on their front doors the next day.
Not at all. I consider it a blessing.
So far, if only because no one is telling me how great I ought to be.
I just want to learn, I don't want to think about what's expected of me.
Mages in Cyrodiil are all about politics. The Synod and the College of Whispers are too busy guarding secrets to bother to teach.
My family was convinced coming here was a death sentence, or worse. It took years of insisting that this is what I'm meant to do.
Skyrim was not J'zargo's first choice, but Winterhold is removed from politics, dedicated to study. This is the place for J'zargo to become great.
Now, what would you like to purchase?
Wonderful! Here is the key to your new home.
Is there anything else you'd like to purchase?
Splendid! There's a house available right now.
Very well, just let me know when you have the necessary funds.
I'm sorry, but you don't seem to have enough gold to pay for that.
Very well, just let me know when you're ready to purchase the house.
The house I mentioned earlier is still available, if you want to buy it.
As you wish. Speak to me again if you decide to purchase some decorations for your home.
I'll be glad to help you. There are many ways to improve your home, provided you have the coin.
You've already purchased every available improvement. I'm afraid I have nothing else to offer you.
Very well, I'll make the arrangements. The next time you visit your house, your new furnishings will be in place.
And of course, don't forget to consult your Home Decorating Guide for descriptions of the decorations you can buy.
Oh, yes. Hunting is my great passion.
He tends the store, and I've got this stall.
That's why my brother and I opened a shop to sell hunting supplies. It's the Drunken Huntsman, down by the main gate.
One group has hidden out in the Pale.
One group has hidden out in the Rift.
One group has hidden out in Whiterun.
One group has hidden out in Eastmarch.
One group has hidden out in Falkreath.
One group has hidden out in Haafingar.
One group has hidden out in the Reach.
One group has hidden out in Hjaalmarch.
One group has hidden out in Winterhold.
Only true Imperials request that one.
You must be a Stormcloak through and through to request that one.
Please give me a chance to try again.
Well I really would like to make sure I've corrected what happened last time.
Right, the leader of the Stormcloaks.
They claim to be fighting for Skyrim's freedom, but the war is really all about Ulfric wanting to be High King of Skyrim.
Slow? No. It just ain't there at all.
Now... Well, let's just say the front door doesn't get much use.
Few enough reasons to pass through Morthal before the war started.
So how are things with you and Bolli?
Nivenor! How can you say that? He gives you everything you ask for.
How do you think? He's a pig. All I am to him is a warm body to lay with.
If I cared for your opinion on our affairs, I'd ask. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Sorry, mother. I'll focus on my work.
The metal has been stubborn today. It refuses to bend.
Save your anger for the forge. The steel cannot hear your whining.
Thank you. It would mean a lot to me.
The Dawnstar Sanctuary? Whatever for?
Find Arnbjorn. Make sure my husband's all right.
Never mind, it doesn't matter. You need to leave. Now.
And then, send that jester's twisted little soul to the Void, in as many pieces as possible.
Every moment counts, so I want you to take my horse. His name is Shadowmere. You'll find him outside, by the pool. Let's just say he's... one of us.
The streets of Windhelm are now safe.
It pains me to see that the whispers had truth to them.
I don't want to believe it. Wuunferth has been a trusted friend to Ulfric for many years.
Wuunferth shall be apprehended. I thank you for your diligence in getting to the bottom of this matter.
There are indeed. Three, to be exact.
Well aren't we the eager one? Sorry to disappoint, but there's nothing. Try me again later.
There's Deekus, a shipwreck scavenger. Ma'randru-jo, a traveling caravaner. And Anoriath, a hunter.
Hmph. How about, instead of giving you another contract, I simply deride you for not finishing the one you still have?
So it would appear. Though I'd suspect she'd want you to complete your other contracts first. Do those, then we'll talk about something new.
Tomorrow. I'll let you know tomorrow.
Have you given my idea any more thought? You said you'd let me know yesterday, and that obviously didn't happen.
Come on now, we discussed that. I wouldn't be traveling all of Skyrim. It'd just to Whiterun and back, that's it.
Oh, I don't know. Yes, we'd make more money, but I don't like the idea of you traveling alone out there with the war and talk of dragons.
Um, excuse me. Could I buy two leeks.
My mother always used to say that too.
Fine, Ataf. You should eat some more tomatoes, though.
Very good. Come, the people await us.
Very well. I respect your discretion.
Was there anything else she told you?
What? Nightingales? But, I always assumed they were just a tale... a way to keep the young footpads in line.
Welcome to our stronghold, Blood-Kin.
Feel free to trade with our smiths for Orc weapons and armor. Train with my warriors, or purchase poisons from the wise woman.
What? How... where did you get these?
Here, take this and don't mention a word of this to anyone, especially Svana!
If word got out that I'm practicing my Dibellan Arts in Riften, they'll run me out of town.
No, don't tell me. I don't want to know. Look, we need to keep this quiet... between you and me, okay. No one else needs to know about it.
What's happening? No! Leave me alone!
What? An intruder? Attack, my lovelies!
Ah, another plaything for my collection.
Whatever you want. But let's go, now.
If you like. But we need to find a way to unlock that trap door.
Whatever. Just get back to work. Now.
You touch her, and I swear it'll be your fingers that go missing, you stupid Breton!
Voada, you spilled laundry water in the soup pot again! Do I need to cut off your fingers to teach you a lesson?
Now now, brother. Arnoit is just being his usual gloomy self, he didn't mean it, did you Arnoit? You're just being silly again.
Why, thank you Thonar. I'm flattered.
You're a very pretty young woman, Rhiada.
Eltrys, yes, just last season we were wed.
You're married, yes? To that young metal worker?
Thank you, Thonar. That's generous of you to say.
He's a lucky man to have such a beautiful young wife.
Would you like to buy a lady a drink?
What would Hroggar say if he heard I was drinking with you?
After all you've put that man through. You should be more loyal to him.
Forget about Hroggar. He's always so tired lately. I need someone with a little fire in their blood.
Yeah. That's what it's going to take.
You've got a lot of nerve. But not a lot of common sense.
Easy there. I don't want that kind of trouble. Guy ain't worth it.
There's no need for that. Not like he's a friend of mine or anything. Just calm down.
You been talking to those Companions?
[QUOTE]Too hot-headed,[QUOTE] they cried. Weak, pathetic cowards, the lot of them!
You may even be my champion. Perhaps.
And skillfully, too. I've been watching you for ages, it seems. You have the makings of a fine hunter.
You monster!  I'll kill you for this!
You're finding it. That's bad enough.
You're on! Loser buys the next round!
Bet I can down this ale faster than you!
In your dreams! If I win, the next round's on you!
Bet I can reach the bottom of this flagon before you!
Ah, I think that'll do just the trick.
You'll need a little more coin than what you're floatin' around with.
And just what's that supposed to mean?
Decided to show up for work today, eh?
Let them do the work, that's what you pay them for!
It means I have a business to run, I need to have the books straight and you're barely ever here!
For goodness sake, Bolli! You barely lift a finger yourself when you're here except to point at things for your workers to do.
Another gorgeous gray day, right dear?
I'm gonna go play soldier with a tree!
That's nice, son. Just don't stomp on the crop like last time!
I'll see if I can't get some work done inside, where it's warm.
It's too cold for my bones, but that never seems to stop you, dear.
Any luck locating those jazbay grapes?
Always a pleasure. What brings you back?
I'm a bit busy at the moment, what did you want?
I hope this is important... I get little sleep as it is.
I'm still busy, but I can always make time to speak with you.
I don't suppose you could come back another time? I'm very busy.
This place is boring. Nothing but the same thing every day. Sigh.
I have a lot to do around the farm, so make it quick please. What is it you wanted?
My sister keeps telling me that the farm keeps us alive, but I don't really call this living.
One day I hope to become a painter, but at this rate it looks like it's never going to happen.
I wish I could head to one of the capital cities... maybe even back to Mournhold. Anywhere but here.
Can you imagine how wonderful it would be to set what you see on a canvas so you'd have that memory forever?
As I expected, you favor your friends.
What? Have you forgotten your oath to the Emperor?
But this is supposed to be your work.
Please, don't just let it stay like this. It's disgraceful.
I really don't have time to deal with you right now. Please just let me get back to my work.
What is it... what has happened to the Gildergreen? I have traveled long here to worship beneath its branches.
It was taken by a lightning strike. Wish I had time to deal with it, but it's hard enough with all these wounded from the war.
Come! Come and see what goods I offer.
Goods and wares of all kinds, and all can be yours!
Tools, wares and weapons, all for sale at fair prices.
Far have I traveled to bring you these fine goods. Come and see what I offer.
Damn soldiers always trample my crops.
I'm been farming this bit of land all my life.
Now, you don't let Rogatus cause you any bother.
My boy Leontius lives in Old Hroldan. Damn drunk.
My husband just gets cranky when he doesn't get enough sleep.
You ever have to farm land while there was a battle going on? I have.
Oh, what is this? A visitor? To our farm? Oh, do stay for a while, dear.
I hope my son has found some nice, well-mannered girl to settle down with.
Our son Leontius moved to Old Hroldan nearly 30 years ago. I still miss him.
Rogatus and I have been married over 50 years. He's always been a bit of a grouch.
Next thing you know there will be some kind of damn blight and undead will walk the land.
I've lived through rebellion, Forsworn, undead, witches, wizards, hagravens, and marriage.
Deliver this axe to Ulfric Stormcloak.
One moment. But don't go far. I expect I'll need you.
I've made up my mind, even if my advisors are still squabbling. I'm sending you to Windhelm.
You can return this axe to our friend. The esteemed Jarl of Windhelm has my answer. Make sure he gets it.
Did you see someone run past just now?
Take this and hold onto it. I'll be back for it later. I'll pay you good. Don't lose it.
Don't even get me started on that lot.
Gray-Mane. Now that's a name fills you with pride. We've got roots in Whiterun. We've got history.
They put on airs like they're somethin' special. Sure, they've got money, but they ain't got a shred of honor between 'em.
Enjoy the city. It will suit you well.
You disappoint me. I expected someone from outside Riften to be different, but I see corruption's reach holds little regard for boundaries.
Enough to know that it's not worth it.
Ranmir's a good boy, and he doesn't deserve what fate pushed his way, but there's only so far I'll go to risk my neck.
Feel free to ask me anything you like.
Dinya? I was reading that missive you gave me and I was wondering something about marriage.
Tell you what... if you still feel unsure, come by the temple sometime and we'll talk about it.
No, no... not at all. Mara believes that the spark of a union comes from inside us, not from our appearance.
There's someone I like very much in Riften. I think I'd like to marry him someday, but... well, he's not of my kind. Would Mara be angry?
Fine, but don't say I didn't warn you.
I don't think it's safe mining a cave on top of that crypt.
There's a war on. We need every scrap of ore we can get, so we're going to keep digging. Understand?
Fine, Elf-Lover. I'll find her myself.
Gods, it's a wonder it's in one piece!
You didn't touch it did you? Well no, of course you must have! Did you attempt to wield it? And you're not dead?
Have you made a decision about Falion?
We are all up to something, my dear. All is as it should be.
Yes, but there are concerns. Rumors that he's up to something.
What decision is there to be made? I allowed him to live here. I stand by that.
Have you not heard that ancient verse?
True or not, who would dare deny Ulfric's claim, when the legendary Jagged Crown sits upon his brow?
Going way back to King Harald's time or even before, the High King always wore the Jagged Crown. It was the symbol of his might and power.
The crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and it is said to contain a portion of the power of  every king who has worn it.
[QUOTE]Maw unleashing razor  snow, Of dragons from the blue brought down, Births the walking winter's woe, The High King in his Jagged Crown.[QUOTE]
Hope you didn't catch any of the fire.
We can head back whenever you're set. There's celebrating to be done!
Impressive work. We started the attack once you made the fog scamper away like that.
I am that which you have been seeking.
Your efforts are in vain. It has already begun.
But those who have sent you have not told you what they seek. What you seek.
I assure you that we mean you no harm.
I presume you refer to Ancano's distaste for the Psijic Order?
The Thalmor see our Order as a threat because we have power, and we will not allow them to control us.
I didn't say anything about giving up.
I haven't seen you hunting in a while.
I can afford to buy meat now. I prefer working in the mines, anyway.
I hope you're enjoying the music, sir.
I hope you're enjoying the music, ma'am.
I hope to get into the Bards College one day.
These parties are a great way to earn a little extra money.
It's good practice. Most people barely notice what I'm playing.
I knew this day would eventually come.
Perhaps someday I'll continue where he left off, it's the least I can do considering how much he did for me.
At least poor Sinderion died doing what he loved, his field research. I told the old fool he should take it easy, but he was too stubborn.
I knew you looked like a clever one...
I think her mother, Tova, has the key.
Her mother would have had the key, but she... that family is cursed, I tell you.
I'd be grateful. Kolskeggr is my home.
I'm sure Pavo would be grateful, and we'd all rest a little easier.
But that's nonsense. You can't handle a group of Forsworn by yourself. If their axes don't get you, their magic will.
But, I wouldn't go there if I were you. There's a whole group of them with axes and magic on their side. You'd never stand a chance.
I'd say things couldn't be any better.
Business is absolutely booming, my friend.
Old Delvin certainly takes care of his own, doesn't he.
Everything seems to be working out nicely, wouldn't you agree?
I've taken to hiring a few extra men of my own just to keep up with all the shipments.
Plus, the meadery's doing so well, I'm almost having trouble keeping up with the demand.
Business? Business is actually inconsequential to me. I share little of your lust for coin.
However, as promised, I'll still be more than happy to take any stolen merchandise off your hands.
How could I complain when I went from Sabjorn's lackey to one of the wealthiest merchants in Whiterun in no time at all?
I've been setting up some open trading with Tonilia back at the Guild in Riften, and it's proven to be quite profitable.
There's been no word from the remnants of the Summerset Shadows, so I'm assuming you either eliminated all of them or they've fled Skyrim.
Best of all, there's no need to smuggle things quietly anymore. With the influence we have in Solitude, I can march it right out the front door.
Working with the Guild again is the best decision I've ever made. Protection, respect and a constant flow of coin... it couldn't get any better.
I'm aware of who stole Frost. And why.
Don't tell me - Sibbi and Louis Letrush? Well, Sibbi is in jail and Letrush is certainly welcome to try. My hired help is more than a match for him.
I'm guessing you're the newcomer then?
I'm not accusing you of anything. Yet.
The Dreth family doesn't steal, Indaryn.
What are you saying? You think I had something to do with that?
Romlyn, I've been meaning to speak to you. I did a count at the meadery and we're four cases short... again.
For your sake, I hope you're right. Because if it is you, and Maven finds out, the Dreth family is going to be one member smaller.
I'm not allowed to stand on furniture.
I've got this. Do what you need to do.
We've got troubles enough without the Thalmor and their witch-hunts.
These Thalmor might not like to admit it, but as long as the Empire has Skyrim, the Empire has strength.
This gathering is nothing more than a boast. The Thalmor are reminding us that we're at their beck and call.
I'd rather be back at Whiterun, but while I'm here I might as well get some real news from the other parts of Skyrim.
If the crown exists, it will be there.
Through sources that shall remain nameless, I've tracked down what I believe to be the final resting place of King Borgas - Korvanjund.
It's true, the location of the crown was lost with King Borgas. After the Great Hunt killed him, while he was off on his damned Alessian campaigns.
But legend holds, his body was secretly returned to Skyrim and buried with the crown. Its exact whereabouts lost in the following Wars of Succession.
It has. Here, this is your half, love.
Fortune smiles on us. Here's your share, love.
You want your share, don't you? Here you are, love.
We've made a bit of gold. Here, love, this is your share.
We have a cozy little profit. Here. This is your share, love.
The gold is flowing nicely. Here's your half of the profits, my dear.
Of course it has. Would you expect any less of me? Here, this is your half, my love.
Let's not talk about this over dinner.
Markarth has changed, but the inn is as lively as ever.
The stones aren't what bother me, love. The Forsworn are tearing the Reach apart.
The city hasn't changed that much, dear. Same old dwarven stones gathering the same old moss.
Like inside the Night Mother's coffin.
Dear sister, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting.
Dear brother, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting.
It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never think to look.
Listen, father. I've been thinking....
Dragons? You want to go out and fight dragons? Are you completely off your nut?
Big lizards? By Shor, your mother gave birth to a half-wit. That is the end of this discussion.
Here it comes again. Not happy with a roof and a trade, no. You want to be something entirely... different.
Come on, father, how hard can it be? They're just... big lizards. And those scales and teeth, they must be worth a fortune...
I'm just no good at this. You said it yourself. Gods, I don't even like horses. And if it's true what they're saying about dragons...
Markarth. Is it bloody enough for you?
Mulush. Big Orc fella. Can't miss him.
What? No. Thonar Silver-Blood owns it. He owns everything in Markarth.
Me and Hathrasil mostly. Mulush barks at us all day, but I wouldn't call that honest work.
But he hands all the paperwork over to Nepos the Nose to finish. That old man's back is heavy with burden.
A few people in the Warrens used to work here. Degaine broke some bones a while back. Eltrys quit. Cairine is too sick.
My coat? What do you need my coat for?
Name's Valdr. I hunt out of Falkreath.
Much better. Thanks, friend. I wouldn't have lasted much longer without that.
I may have lost a drop or two of blood. Truth is, I'm not going anywhere like this. Hurts to breathe.
But now what? I can't just walk away. Not with my friends' bodies in there, being torn apart by those beasts.
Spriggans. Niels went down before we even knew to run. Ari died just inside. I never even thought the things were real.
I'll give them a proper burial, then head back. Come find me if you're ever in Falkreath. You'll always be welcome at my door.
We tracked a bear to this den. Good coin for those pelts. We had the big sow cornered when they showed up. Three of them, out of nowhere.
Nice doing business with you, friend.
This one has something sweet for the fellow traveler, if it entices.
Greetings, sister. You look weary. I have something to help you relax, if you're interested.
Greetings, brother. You look weary. I have something to help you relax, if you're interested.
No, no no no. This can't be happening.
No, no. You're not understanding this.
Onmund made a deal. He made that choice, and now he has to live with it.
No! Blackreach was to be my discovery!
No... No! You must be the one who took my skooma!
Sulla, let's just get out of here. Hasn't there been enough death?
Sulla look, the passage is open, wait... there's someone down there!
Where is it? I know you were trying to keep it for yourself J'zhar... You always try to keep it for yourself!
What? Who is this, Brother? Another of the smooth skins looking for food? But this one wasn't trapped with us...
Oh, of course you want me to leave. Just waiting for me to turn my back. So you can have all the glory for yourself!
No! There's got to be more Skooma... Shut up! Shut up!  Don't lie to me J'zhar! You hid it! You always try to steal it from me!
No. However, I know someone who might.
The court wizard of Markarth, Calcelmo, may have the materials you need to get this journal translated.
A word of warning. Calcelmo is a fierce guardian of his research. Getting the information won't be easy.
Now go. And give my best to the bride.
Her name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
Oh! Sounds like I've got a challenger.
You match the bet and we fight until one of us gives in.
Tell you what. How about a friendly wager, just between us. I bet you my entire purse of septims I can beat you in a fistfight.
On the contrary, you exceed the rest.
But, I will honor your request. The gods know of your victories, and they themselves will glory in your deeds.
Pay me? You think this is about money?
And he's transporting some giant box. Says it's a coffin, and he's going to bury his mother. Mother my eye.
Well, there is something. There's a guard, patrols the road that crazy jester is on. He passes by pretty often.
He could have anything in there. War contraband. Weapons. Skooma. Ain't no way I'm getting involved in any of that.
You could report the fool. You know, say he's done something against the law. That will at least get rid of him for me. What do you say?
Have you seen the man? He's completely out of his head. A jester? Here, in Skyrim? Ain't been a merryman in these parts for a hundred years.
Private business, I mean. No visitors.
Riches are a gate-opener around here. Head right in.
Resisting arrest will mean your death.
See, that wasn't so difficult, was it.
Take this as a token of our gratitude.
Now maybe we can put all this behind us.
By the Eight, I didn't think you could do it!
That sounds lovely. You're very sweet.
I've been there before, but I don't know it well.
There's a clear spot just west of Riften. You know the area?
I've been thinking about building that cabin we talked about.
Well that's where I want to build. In the fall forest. Give it an easterly view. The sunrise is almost as pretty as you are.
That's it. Now, let's get out of here.
I've seen a guy in Riften who they seem to think is him.
I damn well hope so. If it helps you twist them up, I'm glad to help.
Not much to go on -- I don't even know where he lives, or his name. But they seemed pretty excited about it.
They're after some old guy named Esbern. Something to do with dragons, I gathered it from listening to them talk when they thought I was out.
That's not for you to decide. Soldier.
I wouldn't have sent you in the first place if it wasn't going to be worth it. Now then...
That's where we'll find Alduin's Wall.
This is what I've been trying to explain. It's in Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden deep in the crags of the Reach.
The execution will proceed as planned.
No, mother. The execution will proceed as planned.
Are you going soft on me, Hemming? Perhaps I made the wrong choice installing you as steward.
But, mother... this is quite a sizable contribution and the crime doesn't befit such a harsh punishment.
There's still the matter of the prisoner to discuss. Now, his family is willing to contribute handsomely if we release him.
Then I have an important task for you.
I need you to break into Mercer's home and search for anything that could tell us where he's gone.
Then she left to join the Stormcloaks.
She came by so Alva could kiss her goodbye.
Then we understand each other... good.
Now, it's time to get your feet wet and I don't want to waste a lot of time talking about anything but business.
Then we've no time to lose. Follow me!
Then you are weak and inconsequential.
There's no gold, nothing shiny at all.
Like anyone would even notice, in all this mess.
I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this isn't it.
Don't sound so disappointed. You wouldn't be allowed to take it even if there was.
They found it! They actually found it!
This wasn't what I wanted. Not at all.
For now, looking after Joric is my job.
I don't understand. Why can't we go home?
We're safe here now. But what of Morthal?
Ignore the Orc. He pays, so I let him stay.
The Jarl does little to protect us these days.
I'm just here to protect the Jarl, not to chat.
This damned war has cost us... me... everything.
I fear for what this change will do to my family.
I... I'm not one for talk. Try to keep to myself.
My mind weighs heavy enough. Leave me to my food.
Morthal has enough problems without you bothering me.
Please don't mind Joric. He's not mad, really he's not.
Keep your wits about you. Morthal's hardly a safe place.
The good people of Morthal have yet to embrace my talent.
Alva's been good to me ever since... well, since the fire.
I can't sleep here. The dreams are even worse than before.
You ask me, we'd be better off without that wizard in town.
Please remain indoors at night. It is dangerous to go outside.
Dark times, indeed. I fear the worst for Morthal and my people.
Leave Idgrod and her family alone. They've been through enough.
Hasn't been seen for a while. She just vanished without a trace.
Have you seen my mother? I'm still waiting for her to come home.
I speak, and others hear. It is my hope that instead they listen.
My mother and father died years ago. Falion takes care of me now.
These people are like cattle. All they do is work, sleep and eat.
My talents are much needed here, in order to keep Morthal... safe.
Some say the swamp took her. Part of me wishes it were that simple.
Well, aren't you the pretty one. I bet all the men chase after you.
I don't... I haven't mother's gift, not quite, but I've seen things.
If you've business with the Jarl, I'd ask that you speak to me first.
There's enough real troubles in the world without making new ones up.
It's difficult sometimes... To know whether what I see is real or not.
It's Falion. He... He did it. I don't know what it was, but he did it.
This isn't the time or place for magic, or whatever it is Falion does.
Unless it's about the mill, I don't have time to talk. Too much to do.
I figure the guards could always use some help, so I keep my eyes open.
Morthal doesn't need any trouble. You keep your nose clean, understand?
Morthal is a troubled place, and it is my duty to see it rest in peace.
You are new to Morthal. We have not spoken before. This is interesting.
Morthal used to be a quiet place. But then, the world used to make sense.
Ignore the talk of spirits and creatures and such. It's just superstition.
I get lost sometimes. I'm not sure where I go, but I'm not... I'm not here.
Gorm thinks I'm mad. He doesn't say it, but I know he thinks it. Is he right?
Well, aren't you the handsome one. You and I should spend some time together.
You'll want to be careful travelin' at night. The marsh is a dangerous place.
Jorgen and I both work hard, all the time. Morthal is important to both of us.
You're different, aren't you? Not like anyone else. Not in Morthal, or Skyrim.
A new face! Such a welcome sight in dreary old Morthal. Welcome friend, welcome!
Do you like magic? Falion says I'm good at learning. I like learning about magic.
Runnin' an inn weren't my plan. But Falion decided to move here, so I joined him.
Falion had his work to keep him busy, and I needed somethin' to do. So, here I am.
Papa says that I shouldn't keep waiting. Why not? Mama has to come home some time.
I'm just a poor man trying to make a living. I'd leave Morthal were it in my power.
In Morthal, there is little to rule. But there is much to teach. And so, I am Jarl.
Been hoping they'd make me a guard, but not yet. Still, I'll help them out if I can.
I try and take comfort in knowing that when all is lost, there is much to be gained.
My boy's to grow up without a mother? What life is that? It's not right, I tell you.
The mill is my responsibility, and that's what I care about. That's all. Understand?
I'm under a lot of pressure. If you don't leave me alone, I won't be held responsible.
The only thing that matters to me is keeping my wife safe. I won't let anyone harm her.
Welcome to the Moorside. If you need anythin', I'll be 'round. Good to have a customer.
Who are the Stormcloaks, and why would mama want to spend time with them instead of me?
I, Lurbuk the Great, will win the hearts of the people of Morthal one day, mark my words!
To be driven from our homes, to be forced here... this is the last thing that Joric needs.
I don't get many customers, but that leaves me time to try things out. Experiment, I guess.
I take what little business I can git. I'm grateful for anyone willin' to spend money here.
I've tried to explain to Lurbuk that his [QUOTE]singin'[QUOTE] is gonna get his throat cut.
There ain't much to offer, but if you wanna place dry to spend the night, I'll rent you a room.
Tamriel is full of wisdom and magic, if one is willing to look for it. Few have their eyes open.
It is my hope that I will one day return to Hjaalmarch. But the Divines have not shown this to me.
I just try and do my job, and not to think about what's happened. Try to find what happiness I can.
I asked Falion if someday I could learn from the mages in Winterhold, but he doesn't like that idea.
I just want to be left alone to do my job, and to enjoy what little free time I have when I have it.
All that ever mattered was what was best for Morthal. Leaving it in Ulfric's hands... It's not right.
My mother sees things. She doesn't know why, but she does. Only sometimes, she doesn't see me at all.
If you need any alchemy supplies, I'll do my best to provide them. Assuming I haven't used them all up.
Someday I'll be Jarl. Mother reminds me often. I hope I can help the people of Morthal the way she has.
So, life has brought you to Morthal, and to me. What purpose this serves, we will no doubt see. Welcome.
The fair Jonna does me a great courtesy by allowing me to entertain the guests of her noble establishment.
I keep hoping this is another vision, that it's not real. But it is, isn't it? We really have lost our home.
Too many bother my wife with their petty problems, and then don't even understand the advice she gives them.
I do what I can to see that Idgrod's time isn't wasted, and that she only has to deal with important matters.
We've gone from a Jarl lost in her own head to a Jarl that cares for nothing but herself. Lot of good that does us.
Don't fret over the gloom, there's nothing to fear! Old Lurbuk will brighten your spirits -- just lend him your ear!
There is too much to learn in the world, too much to know, to fight over [QUOTE]laws[QUOTE] that have no real purpose.
The Empire brought stability, assurance to the people of Morthal, even if they didn't appreciate it. Now what do they have?
Try as you may, they won't say [QUOTE]good day,[QUOTE] but will just walk away. Worry not, Morthal! Lurbuk is here to stay!
The changes in Morthal are of little consequence to me. So long as the laws are upheld, I do not care who does the upholding.
All this talk of rebellion and strife. Too many are focused on what might be instead of what is. It tires me to talk about it.
The people here work so hard, and they never allow themselves a moment of fun. It's such a pity. It won't last forever though.
I know you for what you are. This town's blood is ours. Leave it! Now we must return to our roles lest the sheep suspect the wolves.
Gathering plants, picking mushrooms, brewing potions. It all gets so dreary after a while. This town needs something exciting to happen.
Thank you for saving me from Alva. I was completely under her evil spell. I'll never forgive myself for what happened to Helgi and my wife.
Trust Septimus. He knows you can know.
Two things I have for you. Two shapes. One edged, one round.
The round one, for tuning. Dwemer music is soft and subtle, and needed to open their cleverest gates.
Find Mzark and its sky-dome. The machinations there will read the Scroll and lay the lore upon the cube.
The edged lexicon, for inscribing. To us, a hunk of metal. To the Dwemer, a full library of knowings. But... empty.
Wasn't by choice, I can tell you that.
So I opened a shop to try and get by. Now, though...
Without the coin to pack up and leave, I decided to take to trading.
Have to admit, I'm attached to the place. Suppose that makes me crazy, doesn't it?
Options were in short supply. Ranmir and I grew up here, and nearly any money I make, he drinks away.
Options were in short supply. Ranmir and I grew up here, and his drinking soaked up whatever coin we had.
We will see if they still remember us.
Even the Greybeards must bend to the winds of change, it seems.
Paarthurnax has made the decision to help you. This is the road we have to walk.
So be it. Tell Ulfric and General Tullius that the Greybeards wish to speak to them.
Well, please let me know when you are.
Well, we can always use contributions.
I don't think so. Clean up your own mess.
Oh you must be nobility of some sort. Running around partying and paying others to clean it up.
What about Mercer? Have you asked him?
If he does, he isn't telling me a thing. I've asked, but all I get from him are more questions.
No, and I'm not about to either. I value my life you know... you may want to remember that for yourself.
You seem to be a bit closer to Brynjolf than the rest of us. Is he giving you any idea why this place seems to be falling apart?
What do you think we'll find in there?
It's thousands of years old. Who knows what we might find?
Don't get any ideas. We're here on official business, remember?
I'm betting bodies. Lots and lots of bodies. And maybe some valuables...
Which brings me to my present concern.
I have little need for mindless thralls.
My servants serve their own purposes. But, if their will is insufficient, nor suitably aligned with mine, I simply destroy them.
You are likely better informed than I.
Krosis. No. I know little of what has passed below in the long years I have lived here.
You mind swinging that somewhere else?
You see? That's why I didn't tell you!
No, but his housecarl sent us a letter.
Why didn't you tell me? What did he say?
What about Ulfric? Did you ever hear back from him?
He... thanked us for contacting him, but said they didn't need any more lumber at the moment.
You were told to find it, weren't you?
If the stories about the staff are true, if it really can absorb a tremendous amount of power, maybe we can break through Ancano's magic.
You... what? How could you possibly...
Oh, so you're trying to play both sides, is that it? What do you really want?
You'll have to come back another time.
The sisters are communing with Dibella. They can't be disturbed.
You're not very good at this, are you.
Look, I traded a staff to someone and found out later that was a bad idea. So, I'd like the staff back. Understand now?
You're the one with the staff, my boy.
You're the one with the staff, my dear.
Your kindness will never be forgotten.
Here, take this. It's all I can offer for what you've given me.
...rise from death, Blood of our Blood.
Heart of thorn... bones of the wild... in life, Forsworn...
...hear he's decided to let the Hags turn him into a Briarheart.
Heh, a Nord skull makes the best axe blade. 'bout all they're good for.
That's a true Reachman. Hope he heads to Markarth to take out some of those Nords.
A citizen of Skyrim has been kidnapped.
A citizen of the Pale has been kidnapped.
A citizen of the Rift has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Whiterun has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Eastmarch has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Falkreath has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Haafingar has been kidnapped.
A citizen of the Reach has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Hjaalmarch has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Winterhold has been kidnapped.
A Septim? As in... a gold coin? Really?
I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?
Ah, I see now. That would give the Potage le Magnifique a slightly metallic - but delicious - aftertaste. Simply brilliant.
Ah the bard-to-be. Did Viarmo send you?
Amaund Motierre? But that would mean...
And here's your payment for the shards.
Look at them. The legendary sharpness of a deadric weapon. Marvelous.
And those winds issue from my whispers.
You may think so. But in the end, you mortals will always flit like fire with the winds of your desires and conveniences.
And you think that I care? Interesting.
I don't believe in getting my hands dirty. You have people that handle those sort of things... use them.
Are you kidding me? Look at this place.
If he sees the meadery in this state, I'll be ruined.
I'm supposed to be holding a tasting of the new Honningbrew Reserve for the Captain of the Guard.
As you can see, it has not yet arrived.
Malacath has given me a vision of a glorious death. I am to wait here until it finds me.
My time has come. I am old. Too old to become chief. It would be wrong for me to take wives at this age. So I will die.
Ask her about it if you want an earful.
Uf. Have you been talking to Viola Giordano? She posts those all over the city, and someone keeps taking them down.
Blessing of Arkay to you for your help.
If you find that sword, traveler, I'd be grateful.
Oh, you could? I sure would love to have it again. Could show you some of my old scouting tricks.
Hey, if you find it, I could show you some of the clan's favorite fighting moves. They're all shield techniques.
Well, aren't you sweet? I'd be happy to give you some alchemy training in exchange for the ring, if you bring it to me.
Getting the real sword would be even better than making a copy, but no one wants to risk getting it from its resting place.
According to my grandfather at least. He swore that version of the legend was true, even found the cave old Lenne stumbled into.
Jarl wants it to look like an ancient blade. High Queen Freydis ruled over Windhelm in the Second Era, and her sword was legendary.
But regrets are pointless. Here we are.
Take your seat at the council table and let us see what wisdom we can find among these warriors of Skyrim.
But you'll understand that soon enough.
You're wrong. It is my business. You may be the only one that can stop these dragons.
By order of the Jarl, stop right there!
Halt. You're under arrest for murder and conspiracy against the city of Markarth!
You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in your defense?
The [QUOTE]problem[QUOTE] is your disrespect for the laws of this land. It's time to face the Jarl's justice.
Clear Namira's sanctuary of the undead.
You've come. The draugr infesting Namira's sanctuary are inside.
Come back as soon as you have the helm.
Did you want something? I'm quite busy.
Look, I'm busy. Please go bother somebody else.
I'm dying for a rest. I swear, I could lie down right now, and just sleep forever.
Would it kill you to let a man go about his business in peace? Really, the nerve...
Don't let Viola catch you in her house.
Have you taken care of that... little problem?
Sneak that ring back to Viola before we both get caught.
extremely tired, blocking with a shield
[no text -- heavy breathing due to fatigue]
Fancy robes. You a wizard or somethin'?
Wow! Look at that robe. Are you a wizard?
Those are College of Winterhold robes, aren't they?
I like your robes. Are you a sorcerer? From the College?
You must be one of those wizards. From the College in Winterhold.
Are you a member of the College, or did you just steal those robes from a real wizard?
For all I know, the Gourmet is a woman!
Then you know that Gourmet keeps his identity a secret. I'm hoping to discover who he is, so I can tell him how he changed my life.
For now, give the papers to my Steward.
I see... Give the papers to my Steward.
I suppose it's time I give him an answer...
Until that dragon's dealt with, I don't care what Tullius wants.
For now, I'll hold onto this axe. But it's a tenuous peace at best.
But until that dragon's dealt with, Ulfric's just going to have to wait.
Get over there and see what you can do.
Don't make me the fool and let me down, all right?
Not only that but they're givin' us thieves a bad name by murderin' their marks.
Got word from Torsten Cruel-Sea in Windhelm that a rival Guild is tryin' to get itself started.
We actually got a request from one of the most powerful families in Whiterun, the Battle-Born's.
I need you to make your way to Solitude and talk to Erikur. He's lookin' to run some kind of a shill job.
I want you to head out to Markarth and speak to Endon. He's a silversmith... has some kind of a shop there.
His father was a good friend of the Guild back in the day, and we could really use his family's influence back on our side.
Make your way up there and look for Olfrid. He says he's got a matter that requires a delicate touch, and I suggested you for the job.
Now, he's not exactly goin' to welcome you with open arms, but keep your cool. Do this job right and we've just made an important friend out there.
Haven't heard from him in a long while.
Those falls... dangerous place. Derkeethus thought he could find some good fish in the pools.
He is rather handsome though, isn't he?
I haven't figured it out yet, but I will.
Don't trust that one. He's up to something.
Most here are up to something, of course, but in his case, it's not good.
Hey now, don't take all the good stuff!
Hmm... these are interesting reports...
Now, I believe you have some business to conclude with my court wizard?
Now get out of here and to the outpost! I need to know what's happening out there.
Hogni Red-Arm, more like Hogni Fat-Arm.
Look at you, begging on the streets. Learn a trade.
How dare you. No one turns down cut meat from Hogni Red-Arm!
Picking on me again, you backbiting Nord? Tired of those prissy nobles turning down your rotten slabs of venison?
How do you put up with that fop Fihada?
You don't put up with a man like that. He puts up with you.
I once saw Fihada put an arrow in between the eyes of a Blackblood Marauder at five hundred paces.
I can't believe I just met the Gourmet!
I don't know, but he sounded impatient.
He didn't say, but you'd better move fast.
I don't like making him angry, but there is some work for you if you want it.
Don't know. He just said he needed to talk to you before you do anything else.
There's probably something I could find for you to do, but best to check with him.
I hope not. That ring is irreplaceable.
No, I haven't. Don't tell me you've lost it.
Aerin, have you seen my ring? The one with the inscription?
I'll look around the house and if I find it, I'll bring it to you right away.
I hope the Caller turns you inside out!
I was only trying to help you, you know!
I just want to make sure I'm moving up.
This isn't the military, son. There are no ranks.
But aren't the Circle in charge? And don't you lead them?
Do you think I could be a member of the Circle? Some day? If I work hard?
I guide the Companions. The Circle advises me. But we are all free warriors. Only our honor binds us together.
Don't worry about such things. Just focus on your own honor. Bring glory to the Companions, and that glory will return upon you.
I know what I'm doing. Stop telling me.
Careful of the molten metal. That gets on you, kiss your fingers goodbye.
I see you are eager to carry the light.
This is the prayer heard by the goddess and relayed to her servants.
As you venture, Mara fills my mind ever more with visions of love in peril.
Embers lie nestled in stone, needing only fuel to bloom to a flame that will warm all around them.
Go to Markarth. There you'll find Calcelmo, wise, acid, and reclusive. Help him to emerge and state his intentions.
I thought today was going to be boring.
Whoa. Wait a second. I was just kidding. We'll leave. We'll leave!
I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen.
I've been working on a shield for Aela.
My wife is in mourning and I need to get back to her soon. I'd be much obliged if you could take this to Aela for me.
If you want to know that bad then fine.
I'm afraid that kind of thing doesn't work on Captains in the Imperial Army.
Inn's closed. Bar's still open, though.
Feel free to sit and put your head down on the table for as long as you like. I won't bother you.
Is there something I can help you with?
I hear there's baked slaughterfish tonight.
Sondas takes care of me when mom's not around.
What's your trouble? Dasturn telling tales again?
I try to think of it as coaxing the ore from the rock.
Hi! I've never seen you around here before. Are you a miner too?
Mom says the Empire is mean, but I don't think they're that bad.
I do love my wife. Just wish she'd get her head out of the clouds.
I keep hearing stories about Morrowind. Sounds like a wretched place.
Derkeethus used to take me diving way down deep in the river. I miss him.
I'm not proud of Hrefna's father. If she knew him, she wouldn't be either.
A traveler? I'll be you've seen some sights. We should swap tales sometime.
Annekke used to help more with the mining, but nowadays she's a bit of a bounder.
If you want some information about the area, Annekke knows it better than anyone.
We keep hearing that the war could come through here. I try not to worry about it.
Sometimes I feel like Annekke cares more about finding new rocks than being with me.
There's a gorgeous tree that grows right up through a cave to the northeast of here.
The Stormcloaks are named after Ulfric. He's a bad man, but don't tell the soldiers that.
You looking for work? We could use an extra hand in the mine. Just bring me any Corundum you dig up.
It's tough to keep track of Hrefna. If her father wasn't such a snowback, he'd be around to help out.
If you're heading to Kynesgrove, stick to the road. Some pretty dangerous caves between here and there.
Verner used to love exploring before we got married. Now he's become a bit of a milk drinker. Likes to stay home.
If you head straight west from where the White River splits towards Whiterun, you can get a look at the Cradlecrush giants.
It was lost years ago in a Dwemer ruin.
Without it, I feel almost as defenseless as a newborn. I don't think I'll ever be able to find a replacement.
It's good to see you in one piece, lad!
It's good to see you in one piece, lass!
It's time. The Skull must be destroyed.
If you'll stand back, I'll perform the ritual granted to me by Lady Mara.
Let's get out of here, for pity's sake!
Now the Thalmor will be hunting me for the rest of my life. I hope it was worth it.
I should have known this would end badly. I can't believe I let Delphine talk me into this.
Mind your manners in this hall, friend.
No? Then how do you like the idea of having your legs broken?
Next to the door, the room on the left.
Oh, you wanted the attic room? Why didn't you say so the first time?
Attic room, eh? Well... we don't have an attic room, but you can have the one on the left. Make yourself at home.
The thing is... we don't actually have an attic room. But I think I know what you mean. Go ahead and make yourself at home.
No, not that it's any of your business.
Oh, got a bit of an interest in your boss do you?
Leigelf is a good man, and I'm not running out on him now.
You should quit working in the Eastern Mine. Leigelf's no good to work for.
Not too full on bread and wine, I hope?
I always leave room for the main course, Eola.
Now we can get back to work. Thank you.
You did? We were waiting for the Jarl to send an entire regiment to clear that mine.
Oh, splendid! I can't wait to use them.
Lady Haelga, so pleased to see you. Your Marks of Dibella are ready.
Maybe I'll show you one day, Madesi. Have them delivered to the Bunkhouse, won't you?
Begging your pardon milady... I know these have something to do with Dibella, but whatever are they for?
Oh? Well, I won't turn down your money.
An investment? Very well, I don't see why not.
How kind. At my age, I've certainly learned how to spend wisely.
An investment, is it? Alright, I'm sure I can put the extra money to good use.
Splendid! I've been looking for a new investor. Now it seems my search is over.
Ah yes, good idea. Best to let a professional businessman handle that money for you.
By helping me, you're helping the good folk of Whiterun. How could I say no to that?
Of course you want to invest in my business. I'm the finest blacksmith in all Skyrim.
Come to see the hag with an offering of coin, then? So be it. I accept your investment.
You make an interesting offer. Very well, I'm sure that I can put the extra coin to good use.
Such an investment will mean that I can take better care of my family, as well as my customers.
I've been looking to expand the business, and your investment will certainly help with that. I accept!
Splendid! With the extra coin, I'll be able to purchase twice the volume in supplies that I normally do.
You want to give me money? Just like that? Fine, but I intend to earn that investment. I don't need handouts.
I'll take your money, but I make no promises of a large return on your investment. These are troubled times, after all.
Outrageous! Who does she think she is?!
Madesi, what's this bill for 300 septims!
I believe she's trying to look as ravishing as possible for you, milord.
Begging your pardon, milord. Your wife has run up quite an account in the last few months.
Oh, well... I suppose that's a noble cause. I'll settle this bill at the end of the day. Thank you.
Owning a farm does have its advantages.
Ah, Ysolda was it? What brings you to the market?
I'm here to buy food, Nazeem. I suppose you don't need to worry about that.
Really? Was it big? Did it breath fire?
Shor's bones, boy. What did I tell you?
Shor's bones, girl. What did I tell you?
Sister, how is my fortune coming along?
Fair or not, they'll pay it, and that's all I need to care about. Bear that in mind, sister.
Yes, brother. I'm sure they'll agree it's a fair price to pay in order to avoid interacting with you on a daily basis.
I'm afraid [QUOTE]acceptable[QUOTE] just isn't acceptable anymore. I'm sure they can spare a few more coins in monthly rent.
Profits continue to rise. The warehouse continues to bring in good revenues, and rent on your stores in the Well is acceptable.
So, have you thought about what I said?
Just stay away from me and maybe I won't weave a spell to shrink something that matters to you.
I find the concept of sleeping with you not only repulsive, but morally unsettling. Does that answer your question?
You listen to me. I'd be careful wagging that pretty little tongue at me like that otherwise I may just have it cut off.
Thank you for your role in all of this.
It'd be my honor should you decide to make Whiterun your home. Speak with Proventus. He'll make the necessary arrangements.
Thanks. You take care of yourself, now.
That damn fool! I should ring her neck!
That we could avoid having to kill you.
Very well, then. If that's the way you want to play it, we will.
I'd hoped we could work something out, that you would see reason.
That's a little... showy, even for you.
Please... Delphine has been very worried about you.
We heard the news from Whiterun - that you left the city on the back of a dragon!
That's all for today. You're dismissed.
You see, all you need is a bit of spirit and any song can be made into a classic.
This time let's try [QUOTE]The Age of Aggression[QUOTE]. I will demonstrate for the class.
This time let's try [QUOTE]The Age of Oppression[QUOTE]. I will demonstrate for the class.
That's no small amount of coin, friend.
I suppose I can come with you for a short venture. Lead on.
I'm just not up for it, sorry. I'd rather stay here, have a glass of wine, and perform my rites to Arkay in peace.
The kind men use to measure themselves.
The silence became almost... maddening.
Oh... Well... yes. I did. I did indeed. I tried to listen. Tried so hard. But the Night Mother never spoke to poor Cicero.
Oh, but that was then! This is now! You're the Listener, and the Night Mother chose you for a reason, I'm sure! Cicero will remain the happy Keeper.
Then we got nothin' more to talk about.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Once again Brynjolf sends me someone with no backbone, no determination.
Vals Veran will die for what he's done.
That dark elf is about to be a dead elf.
Vegetables are the food of the Divines.
There's nothing quite like a good vegetable.
I've heard stanger things, are eaten over at the Temple of the Divines.
We agreed to 750 gold. I want my money.
Whoa, not so fast there, friend. You owe me money.
Hey! There you are, you drunken bastard. I did it, so pay up.
You and Sam dared me to go into that bandit camp. Well I did and brought back his stupid hat like you said, so give me the 10,000 gold you promised.
We are ready to mount our final attack.
We could always look for another brand.
Keerava, we're running low on Black-Briar Mead.
If only Maven would stop raising the price on it maybe I could afford to stock more cases.
That isn't an option. Maven sees me serve a competitor's brand here and we may as well dig our own graves.
We will see if you truly have the gift.
Show us, Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice.
We'll keep peace and order in Dawnstar.
The Empire has stretched itself too far. This rebellion in Skyrim is one problem, but solving it won't fix everything.
But that's the kind of talk an old warhorse shouldn't be making. Don't worry. I have my problems with the Empire, but I'm still a soldier first.
Well I'll be! That'd be a sight to see.
Not that I actually want to see one, understand. I hope that dragon stays far away from here.
What exactly did this amulet look like?
My what, now? I've never kept a journal, I can assure you.
Who needs customers and their old junk?
We hardly ever get new customers anymore.
We'll make it through, dear. We always do.
Sure has been quiet around the shop lately.
Not that I mind the break, of course. But, still...
It's okay, dear. More work than ever down at the blacksmith.
Father oughtta punch them in the mouth! That'd get people in here!
I suppose in wartime, people aren't looking to part with their old junk...
Yes, but I am honor-bound to stay here.
You're right. Look at me, talking in circles like some old wise woman. Very well, outlander. You have my axe when you need it.
Yes, father. Which cask should we open?
Good idea, sis. Maybe you ought to be in charge!
Bring up some more mead, my boy. This cask's nearly tapped!
Yes, yes, fine. Just hurry! Mustn't keep the customers thirsty!
Fat Toad 190 is always a crowd-pleaser. Father could probably charge extra.
Any of them! Just hurry up! No time for a debate when customers are thirsty!
We just got a cask of Old Gold 200 that has a crack in it. Better serve it now before it goes bad.
Just bring any of them, lad! Can't risk thirsty customers without mead to drink, even for a second!
Bring the Blackbriar 195 Berry-Blend. It should be at its peak right now, and if it doesn't get served soon, it'll only go bad.
Yes, yes. We should proceed cautiously.
You are exactly what I was looking for.
You dare challenge a child of Malacath?
I am not weak. Very well, outlander, I will go with you whenever you are ready.
You there. What do you know about this?
You would? Oh, that would be wonderful.
Speak to Filnjar in Shor's Stone. He's got some sort of ore sample he wants us to identify and was willing to pay us well for it.
You're the one Mazzaka described to me.
Ah, yes! There it is! Thank you so much.
Ah. No, that was not supposed to happen.
You are a good friend to have done this. J'zargo will not forget it.
But... J'zargo is pleased to see that you are here, and not in pieces!
All right, all right. I'll speak to her.
It's just children playing, Haran. I wouldn't fret over it.
I understand Eirid's been playing [QUOTE]Hunt the Elf[QUOTE] again.
I'm not [QUOTE]fretting.[QUOTE] I don't want Eirid playing those sorts of games!
All right. I'll tell you a little story.
Look how persistent you are. It's charming, really.
Onmund gave up the first time I said no. But not you...
Am I to take your silence as acceptance?
Then you know where we stand. Make your kill, and we're square. Repayment of your debt is but a discreet knife thrust away.
And just what do you think you're doing?
You just can't leave well enough alone, can you?
Aye, that's the work of Septimus Signus.
He's been gone for a long while. Too long.
He's the world's master of the nature of Elder Scrolls, but... well.
But I need your help. We need your help.
I'm glad to assist you in any way I can.
But you and I are going to reclaim them.
No, but they made off with all our fragments of Wuuthrad.
We will avenge Kodlak. And they will know terror before the end.
We will bring the battle to their chief camp. There will be none left living to tell their stories. Only songs of Jorrvaskr will be sung.
By a bold stroke, you bested me, friend.
My blade is restless, unblooded too long.
Well fought, friend. Your fury is unmatched.
With mead and fellowship let's mend our wounds.
Aye. Let us forget our sorrow in the fury of battle.
Meat and mead must ever make way for the clash of steel - the song of battle.
Hail, comrade! Shall we by clash of steel ease the gloom of the encompassing mist?
Shor's favor found me today. Let's lift a mug of mead together, our wounds to salve and weariness cure.
Can you tell me more about what you saw?
Certainly you don't believe such things?
I am a Thalmor Justiciar on important business that you are interfering with.
That we are superior to men is an established fact. For example, take this belief in Talos. The [QUOTE]ninth[QUOTE] divine. Heh.
Come back to me if you change your mind.
Do you wish to test yourself against me?
Ahhhhgh. Wearing flesh is so... distasteful.
You have caught my attention, mortal. That is most unwise.
We are Lord Boethiah's faithful. Have you come to test your mettle?
A well placed word, or a well placed dagger. Both can achieve equal purposes.
If you wish to gain Boethiah's attention, you must slay a thrall upon her shrine.
Though we live in shadow, we carve indelible signs of our passing into the world.
Now the time has come for a final proving. Are you able to cast aside your honor and strike with the hidden blade?
Well done. You have proven the strength of your will and your tongue's gift for lies. You have shown ferocity and prowess in combat.
Easy. I'll sell. Just don't hurt anyone.
Execute every last bandit. Spare no one.
Fine, you win. Take the horse and leave.
You're playing a dangerous game, my friend.
And telling her what? That you stole her horse? I don't think so.
Fine. Take your books and leave at once.
If you ever come back, I won't be so gracious.
Good. Then there isn't much more to say.
Here's your armor, just make sure you put it to good use.
Ha! Humor is often in short supply here.
But I sense that perhaps you're after more than just that.
I don't suppose it matters much anymore.
As long as those orders came from Ulfric.
Oh, most certainly. At least, when Elisif herself asks.
The Thanes have every confidence in General Tullius's leadership.
If you're inquiring whether we have concerns about her age and inexperience, well, let me put it this way...
As long as Ulfric wishes Elisif to remain Jarl, remain Jarl she will. And the Thanes will continue to follow her orders.
I promise I'll help you get out of here.
Oh, you've saved me! Thank you so much. Who knows what they'd have done to me if you hadn't come along.
Thank you, thank you! I promise I'll help. And then I'll go back to the College and I'll beg them to let me back in.
I was afraid you were going to say that.
I hoped to avoid involving them in this, but we have no other choice.
I guess there's nothing for it. We'll have to ask the Greybeards for help.
I... I'm sorry Haelga, I can't. Not yet.
When are you going to take me away from here Bolli?
That old place? I could care less about it. Its you I want, Bolli.
I told you, I can't just pick up and leave. I have my wife, my business... not to mention you have the Bunkhouse.
I... it's like waking up out of a dream.
This is a great service you've done for me, Harbinger. I will not soon forget.
It's like relaxing into a warm mug of spiced mead. I'm losing aches I didn't know I had.
This is how a warrior should feel. Alive and aware. Not clouded with thoughts of the hunt.
I can breathe more deeply now. I can't smell your heart beating the way I used to. But my mind is... clear.
Thank you for your help. I'm going to stay in the tomb for a while. My shame kept me out before, but now I want to see it.
Now... I'd like to spend some time communing with Ysgramor. My soul is clean now. Perhaps he'll still welcome me when my time comes.
I'm sorry, could you describe the smell?
This, this is why people have a problem with your college, Nelacar.
It was a minor miscalculation. I've already corrected it for future experiments.
Like some horrible monster was turned inside out, and then exploded. What did you do?
In some cases, a few never awoke at all.
Sadly, yes. The longer an individual is exposed to the Miasma, the more the mind can become damaged.
Those who've been under the effect of it for extended periods of time have been known to lose their minds entirely.
In time, he brought me here. To the box.
But he won't reveal how to open it. Maddening.
He asks a price -- to work his will. A few murders, some dissent spread, a plague or two. For the secrets I can endure.
The Daedric prince of the unknown. Hermaeus Mora. I thought there were no secrets left to know. Until I first spoke to him.
It's all about sizing up your mark, lad.
It's all about sizing up your mark, lass.
The way they walk, what they're wearing. It's a dead giveaway.
It's going to take a lot more than that.
It's not an insult, just an observation.
Not many people care, these days. The world is the worse for it.
Your outfit is something of an open wound... where attire is concerned.
If I were walking around with a wound, I would want you to tell me to see a doctor.
J'zargo has seen that Tolfdir likes you.
You must be very skilled with magic, yes?
J'zargo is working hard, but cannot do it alone. Can you help with this?
Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.
If you see Karliah, don't hesitate. Kill her.
Let's get going. I want her head on my mantle.
When you're ready, meet me at Snow Veil Sanctum.
That's enough of this unnecessary chatting, we need to keep going.
Have your weapon at the ready. I'm certain Karliah knows we're here.
Lead on. Skjor's already scouting ahead.
We're going to slaughter them. All of them.
The Silver Hand. I think you've met them before.
There's a pack of werewolf hunters camped nearby, at Gallows Rock.
Leave here. Leave here and never return.
Hmph. Don't say much, but there's a strange aura about you. You walk in the shadow of death...
Look around here. There's not much left.
If all the young people leave, what happens to Ivarstead?
Used to be a good-sized town, but folks have been moving to Riften for a while now.
Many folk think he set the fire himself.
Bear fat in the hearth fire, if you believe Hroggar.
I do, but some folk here think he set the fire himself.
Hroggar blames his wife for spilling bear fat in the fire.
Hroggar claims it was a hearth fire. Some folks say Hroggar started it himself.
Maul, can I ask a personal favor of you?
Well that depends on what the favor is, now doesn't it.
Anything you can do to keep his filthy hands off of me would be a welcome change.
It's Hemming. He's making advances and I can't bear the man's presence. Is there anything you can do?
I'll talk to him, but he's stubborn. He's like his mother; he sees what he wants and he won't quit until he has it.
Mutual advantage! Any fool can see that.
For centuries, we have benefited from the Empire's protection, and prosperous trade with the south.
In exchange, the people of Cyrodiil sleep peacefully, knowing their northern border is guarded by the fiercest warriors in all Tamriel.
My brother was the best man in Solitude.
He did the honorable thing, even when he knew it would cost him everything.
Then you didn't know Roggvir, and you have no idea what it means to be a Nord of Skyrim!
No matter, I appreciate your generosity.
My goodness, how did you ever come by all of these?
No more than anyone else, I don't think.
No one has seen or heard from them in over a hundred years now, though.
They're a very old order. Pre-dated the Imperial Mages Guild by quite a bit.
In fact, the Mages Guild was founded in opposition to the idea of the Psijic Order, that only an elite few should have control over magic.
No, no. Mercer wants him alive, for now.
Stubborn or not, he's the only contact we've got at the East Empire Company.
Just keep on his tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.
Of course you will. I have commanded it!
Of course. How are you in a battle, boy?
Of course. How are you in a battle, girl?
Oh you're back. Do you still think you could stand as a Companion?
Oh, very well. Probably safest that way.
One of the Jarls has asked for our help.
The Jarl of the Pale has asked for our help.
The Jarl of the Rift has asked for our help.
The Jarl of Whiterun has asked for our help.
The Jarl of Eastmarch has asked for our help.
The Jarl of Falkreath has asked for our help.
The Jarl of Haafingar has asked for our help.
The Jarl of the Reach has asked for our help.
The Jarl of Hjaalmarch has asked for our help.
The Jarl of Winterhold has asked for our help.
Really? That would be a pleasant change.
I need twenty of them for my current crop.
One of the ingredients I need to cultivate nirnroot are jazbay grapes... the acidic content of the juice is perfect for the soil.
Shahvee would be in your debt, kind one.
I don't know why I'm saying this, but if you find it out in your travels, I'd be grateful to you.
I tracked it to a group of bandits nearby. But I'm no fool. I'd need the Whiterun guards or maybe hire the Companions to get it.
So it's done. You've killed the Gourmet.
And now Titus Mede II is as good as dead.
Someone's going to get hurt, all right.
I'll mark it on your map. This one's on you.
All right, all right! No need to get violent. We're on the same side.
Such a shame. Perhaps another time then.
Sure, that'll do just fine. Go on ahead.
That's just insulting. Not even a proper bribe?
Thank you for your help. You may go now.
Thank you. I appreciate your assistance.
Yes, they have. I can feel the difference already. But of course, I'm far more in tune with these sorts of things than most.
The East Empire Company is in your debt.
I can't thank you enough for what you did.
Glad Orthus was able to find someone competent to help out.
You handled yourself pretty well back at Japhet's Folly. We'll remember that.
Then we have nothing more to talk about.
There is much for J'zargo to be sure of.
There is skill in magic, there is charm, and there is a strong will. J'zargo will be successful, of this there is no doubt.
These Thalmor know how to treat a guest.
You asked for my help. Not for nothing, I hope?
A ruler is entitled to luxury, don't you think? The Thalmor understand that.
Why would anyone join the Stormcloaks? They have a fraction of the Empire's wealth and power.
If I had my way, I'd spend all my time at parties like this, and none of it dealing with the common rabble.
Wabbajack Wabbajack Wabbajack Wabbajack.
You have it! The blessed Wabbajack! You must use it on me. You must.
You're the one who returned blessed Sheogorath. I would be honored to be Wabbajacked by you, your grace.
Welcome to the Imperial Legion, soldier.
Now, if I'm not mistaken. Legate Rikke has a special assignment for you.
Speak to Beirand, he's normally out by the forge. He'll get you outfitted.
Just remember, we take care of our own. Once you're in the Legion, you're in it for life.
Wha... what? Oh, it's one of you people.
Oh! And look, I even have the payment I owed. Here, take it.
So, Brynjolf doesn't even bother to show up himself anymore, eh? What's this message?
Oh! There's no need for that. I know why you're here. Tell Brynjolf not to worry about it anymore.
Then I thank you for showing me mercy. Here, take this coin to him. If it keeps us together, it's worth its weight.
What about them? They seem loyal enough.
Igmund, we need to talk about the Silver-Blood family.
Loyal? Thongvor supports Ulfric and his Stormcloaks! We should imprison the entire family as a precaution.
I second that, Igmund. Who knows what that family will do for power? They could be working with the Forsworn, for all we know.
Enough! We can't imprison the very people that own the jail we would be throwing them into. The Silver-Blood family are to be left alone, am I clear?
What's going on? What happened in there?
What's your business here in Winterhold?
Won't be 'some other time' at this rate.
You can tell Shadr his debt's been paid.
You don't have enough gold to pay it off, and I'm not cutting any deals.
Don't know why you'd help a stranger like that, but a septim's a septim... don't care where it comes from.
You caught me! I surrender! Ha ha ha ha.
Do what you will. Cicero has no fight left. In the end, Sithis will judge us both.
You don't have what it takes to kill me.
To Oblivion with your loot! This ends now!
You must first prove you are in control.
Summoning an Unbound Dremora is not like other Conjuration spells. It will not simply do your bidding.
Here is the spell you need. Go to the top of the Hall of Attainment; I have prepared a place for you there.
You talked Torbjorn down? I'm impressed.
Really? You convinced that lute player to stop chasing me?
It'll be good to not have to hear him whining about his debts.
Roggi pawned a few of his things back when he still had things to pawn. Take them.
I'd thank the gods, but I'll settle for thanking you. Here's some coin for your help.
Here, I was saving this for a rainy day. Maybe now I can afford a few more for my people. Take it.
I don't believe it. Someone sticking up for us. Here. It's a week's wages for me, but you've earned every coin.
You've done a fine thing for me. You know, I used to be quite a warrior in my day. Let me show you a thing or two.
Thank you. He's not a bad man, just bad with his coins and his drink. My husband Dagur could tell you stories, there.
I have a couple of Ranmir's things that he traded to us back when he was still paying regularly. I say you've earned them.
You'll need Kahvozein's Fang, of course.
Not just any dragon scales. Heartscales. Very special.
Even just one should be enough for me to complete my research.
Then, if you should happen upon the corpse of a dragon, you should be able to use it to slice off a heartscale or two.
A group of them has holed up in the Pale.
A group of them has holed up in the Rift.
A group of them has holed up in Whiterun.
A group of them has holed up in Eastmarch.
A group of them has holed up in Falkreath.
A group of them has holed up in Haafingar.
A group of them has holed up in the Reach.
A group of them has holed up in Hjaalmarch.
A group of them has holed up in Winterhold.
And how may Ma'randru-jo assist you, hmm?
Purchase something or leave. Those are your options.
Ataf, please play back that piece for me.
Very good. Let's continue with our practice.
Be sure to watch your finger positions. Especially during the transitions.
barking angrily - someone he doesn't like
barking/panting happily (greeting someone he likes)
Better men have tried. Let's finish this.
You think so? Let's see who the real woman is here.
Born and raised right here in Rorikstead.
My mother passed away when I was just a babe, so he did his best to raise me on his own.
My father was a soldier. He fought in the great war and when it was over, he retired here to raise a family.
It's not the most exciting place in the world, but the people here work hard and don't cause trouble for anyone.
But first, you were introducing yourself.
Don't worry, my parties are always well-stocked with the finest food and drink available in this country.
But his chocolate pate gives me the runs.
The recipes were hailed as both practical and decadent.
I've made a few of the Gourmet's dishes myself, actually. His roast mutton with Redguard berry sauce is to die for.
[QUOTE]Uncommon Taste.[QUOTE] It was published a few years ago, and became a sensation throughout the Empire almost overnight.
But just in case, I'll be ready for them.
As long as she continues to keep me at her side, she can count on my blade to protect her.
At the end of the day, I'm the last line of defense for the Jarl. I will not allow her to fall.
To be honest, I doubt someone would be stupid enough to make an attempt on Maven... sorry, Jarl Maven's life.
We've also had run-ins with spies attempting to probe our security for weaknesses. I work with the city guard to make certain they fail.
Indeed. There have been multiple attempts on the Jarl's life. We're not certain if it's the Dark Brotherhood or simply Imperial sympathizers.
Can you... can you possibly help J'zargo?
J'zargo awaits word of how well his scrolls work.
J'zargo is eager to hear how the scrolls are working.
It is difficult to admit, but J'zargo could still use some help.
Come back when you've got the gold, then.
Come on, think about it. She'd reward us!
So, what do you think of my plan. You in or out?
If you want to go out to Whiterun and burn that meadery down, go right ahead.
And when the guard traces it back here, and Maven is implicated, I'll be sure to tell her it was your idea.
If you think I'd would make a move like that without asking Maven, you're out of your mind. Doing that would be a fatal mistake.
Come, at the very least walk out with me.
Did something happen at the Pawned Prawn?
Just when you think things couldn't get any worse.
I've come to warn you that the Thieves Guild seems to be back to its old tricks again.
One of them came in and demanded payment. Bolli tried to tell them no; stood up to them, but...
Do that and I'll make sure you get a cut.
Do you want me to hold your hand as well?
Then when you have the ring, you pickpocket Brand-Shei and leave it behind.
You have the ring. All you have to do is pick Brand-Shei's pocket and plant it there.
You're going to have to sneak over to Madesi's stall and use your lockpick on the strongbox.
Explore the facets of the infinite jewel.
Not all can hear the broad echoes of deepest dawn.
To receive the touch of Mara, you must first act as her hands in the world.
Figures. You elders are always so boring.
Fine, but we'll be keeping an eye on you.
Fine. It'll be five septims to repair it.
Why should I pay for a repair on something I just bought?
All right, all right. Just bring it to me tomorrow and I'll fix it for you.
Grelka, I wanted to talk about that suit of leather armor you sold me. The fasteners are already coming loose.
For this reason, I avoid them when I can.
Good to hear. Have your share of the pay.
Good work. The mindless cretins didn't stand a chance.
Not bad, not bad. The intensity of the hunt is special, isn't it?
Good, good. She didn't see you take them?
Good work. Here, take this, and keep quiet.
Al right, this should be enough to figure out what she's up to. Then I can make sure it doesn't work.
His real name is Gulum-Ei. Slimy bastard.
Because, even after all their posturing and planning, they've made a mistake.
The parchment you recovered mentions a [QUOTE]Gajul-Lei.[QUOTE] According to my sources, that's an old alias used by one of our contacts.
Hurry back... and bring more merchandise.
Give my regards to Karliah if you see her.
Just remember me if you get your hands on anything else.
When you get back to Riften, tell Delvin this new arrangement's working out quite well.
Do me a favor. If you speak to Maven, tell her everything's well at hand down here, okay?
I beg you, don't go into Silus's museum.
I bet your family would be amazed, right?
Can you believe we're here? Saarthal, of all places.
I'm surprised that the College is allowed to excavate here.
Amazed isn't the right word. They might find this... offensive.
I don't even know who they said I killed.
Guards say I murdered someone. I was just sleeping off some mead in my aunt's house, but that didn't stop them from arresting me.
I figured you had it in you. Nicely done.
Kind of fun to push people around sometimes, isn't it. Good work, sister.
Kind of fun to push people around sometimes, isn't it. Good work, brother.
You seem to have a knack for this kind of thing. I'll make sure people in charge know.
I just don't know if I can keep you safe.
We will keep each other safe. No matter what.
What kind of talk is this? The man I married would never speak of leaving his home.
I wonder if we should finally leave Markarth. These dragon attacks, I think Skyrim is cursed.
I miss her, too, but I'm glad she's safe.
So am I. I hope she's happy at the temple.
Oh, I'm fine, Enmon. I just... I still miss her.
Are you all right, dear? I thought I saw a tear in your eye a moment ago.
I used to be a member of the Morang Tong.
Morrowind of course. Any Dunmer worth their weight in ash would tell you the same.
I'll pay you back, if it means that much.
The sooner you remember that, the better.
The only reason you have the gold for your [QUOTE]business[QUOTE] is because I gave it to you.
I'm sorry you disapprove, father. But I've made up my mind. I'm not a warrior, I'm a businessman.
It's not about the coin, it's about honoring your legacy by picking up arms and keeping this land free.
I'm not quite ready to let go of my wife.
I'm not quite ready to let go of my husband.
I'm worried about my son. I'm keeping an eye on him for a little while before I pass on.
I know my father would be worried about me. I'm here to let him know everything's all right.
I know my mother would be worried about me. I'm here to let her know everything's all right.
I'm worried about my daughter. I'm keeping an eye on her for a little while before I pass on.
I worry about my brother. This way I can keep an eye on him, make sure he's not getting into trouble.
I worry about my sister. This way I can keep an eye on her, make sure she's not getting into trouble.
I'm sure she'll be angry. Brace yourself.
You're doing me quite a favor. I won't forget it.
I'm tired, I haven't slept well in weeks.
You keep your mouth shut, and I pay you. Handsomely.
You kill the giant, bring me the hammer. We go back to Largashbur, I tell everyone I did it.
If you can find me first, I can tell you.
I can't tell you. She might hear me. She's so close.
In the depths of Blackreach one yet lies.
Lucky then they left behind their own way of reading the Elder Scrolls.
You see this masterwork of the Dwemer. Deep inside their greatest knowings.
Septimus is clever among men, but he is but an idiot child compared to the dullest of the Dwemer.
Have you heard of Blackreach? [QUOTE]Cast upon where Dwemer cities slept, the yearning spire hidden learnings kept.[QUOTE]
It lick the panes and smokes the glass...
Dig, Dwemer, in the beyond. I'll know your lost unknown and rise to your depths.
When the top level was built, no more could be placed. It was and is the maximal apex.
How long will it be sung? My feet were set upon the rock but it turned to mud and drew me down.
It's been an honor to serve you, brother.
Remembers our lessons from the sword masters of Alcaire? Let me show you a few things you may have forgotten before we leave Hroldan.
It's very particular, and very important.
Perhaps you could seek out these Convectors in Skyrim ruins? I can even teach you the spell to heat them.
I'd go looking myself, but uhh... Yes, there are calculations to double- and triple-check. Many calculations.
Well, yes. The designs for my Convector were based on real dwarven machines, so there may still be some in existence.
Just calm down. I'll tell you everything.
Do you think muscling me is going to work? I'm a wizard. An old. Elven. Wizard. Think about it.
Just keep at it, or Mulush will beat you.
Divines, I'm tired. This is too much work.
Keep your eyes on him, he's quite crafty.
There are thieves and then there is Gulum-Ei. No honor, no code at all. He'd shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time.
The cut he's supposed to provide the Guild has dwindled as of late. He says pickings in the warehouse are slim, but I'm certain he's lying.
May Kynareth's winds blow you to fortune.
Maybe if I don't talk, they won't either.
I shouldn't be. Everyone wants to ask me about mama and uncle Roggvir.
I shouldn't be. Mama says if I do, people are going to ask about uncle Roggvir.
Maybe you could be a taster or something.
Ah, but I can do that right here. Right now!
If you like mead so much, why not go live in Riften?
Oh, I wouldn't be able to help them. Their skills were given by the Divines.
Men aren't good or bad. They're just men.
There are a lot of good men buried here, Kust.
Might even give you a bit of gold for it.
I've never seen anything like it. I would take this to Calixto at the House of Curiosities. He has a good eye for strange trinkets.
My father owned it until he... passed on.
Well... okay. My father owns the Winking Skeever. But it's the family business, so it'll be mine when he kicks off.
My Jarl, we need to discuss the Forsworn.
They live here too, my Jarl. That's what I'm telling you.
It's not that simple, Igmund. There are reports of Forsworn here in the city.
The only thing we need to discuss is how many men it'll take to flush them out of the hills.
It doesn't matter if they're in the city. We fight them where they live, we won't have to fight them here.
No doubt exactly as the Thalmor intended.
Part of the cost of peace. Emperor Titus Mede saved his Empire at a very high price. A price that included the Blades.
The Nords didn't like the peace treaty much either. Thirty years later, the Empire ends up with the Stormcloak rebellion on its hands.
No politics, Thongvor. I told you before.
Hello, my friend. Come to visit the forge?
Your family's success burdens you, does it?
I grow tired of counting coin all day. Put steel in my hand, not gold.
Sometimes I miss the Legion, back when the Empire stood up for Skyrim.
Nothing, Ragnar. Please... don't hurt me.
I... I'm sorry, Belchimac. I didn't mean that.
Damn Nords. Always getting in the way of us honest folk.
What did you say? You lazy coward, I'll cut your throat.
Oh my, that's quite a difficult question.
They can turn the tide of a battle in a moment's notice.
There are also spells that help in avoiding conflict altogether. Invisibility is tricky to master, but exceptionally useful.
Never underestimate the ability to influence others. Whether they're friends or foes, they're almost all susceptible to Illusion spells.
Oho! I thought you'd never figure it out.
The butler did it! Or is it the advisor? Whoever that man behind the throne was.
Hmm... Your creature doesn't appear to be fairing any better than before. Methinks your aim is off.
The objective here is simple, you simpleton!  Use your Wabbajack to defeat the enemy, while they do the same!
That woman wielded fear like a cleaver. Or did she wield a cleaver and make people afraid? I never get that part right...
Oh, good choice. Well, good for me. I find everyone being out to get you so terribly entertaining. You might find it... less so.
Oh, but she taught her son well. Pelagius learned at a very early age that danger could come from anywhere. At any time. Delivered... by anyone.
With the threat gone Pelagius is under the delusion that he is safe, which means you've helped him... sort of. And we're that much closer to home.
You see, Pelagius' mother was... well... let us say [QUOTE]unique.[QUOTE] Although, I suppose in the grand scheme of things, she was fairly average for a Septim.
Okay. Stand very still. This might sting.
Onmund's amulet in exchange for my staff.
Yes, I thought we'd gotten past that bit already.
Let's also pretend that he traded some valuable items for said staff.
And it was only later that it was realized that this individual might... misuse such a staff.
The resulting disaster would reflect quite poorly on everyone involved. Are you following me?
Let's pretend for a moment that a certain individual was looking to acquire a particular staff.
Our stock of arrows is running a bit low.
All right. I'll fletch some more when I get the time.
Good. I'll do the same. We've still got plenty of shafts from that Riverwood shipment.
Really? I wrote that off a long time ago.
Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain.
Give this document to Vald. It frees him from the debt, but I never want to see him in Riften again.
Return with the gauntlets, or not at all.
So if you don't have any business. Leave.
If you must know, I'm the maid. And the master of the house is old and needs his rest.
So, what is the first special ingredient?
Maybe we should start over, hmm? We want the Gourmet's famous Potage le Magnifique to be perfect, after all.
Sorry, but you don't exactly belong here.
Stendarr's Light purify you of your ills.
Talk to my parents if you need something.
Finally, my leadership is being recognized.
Don't bother the miners. They've got work to do.
I'm in charge now that my parents are in Morthal.
My business is my own. Why can't others see that?
Nothing here but the mine. Probably best you keep moving.
My job is my life. Whatever happened before doesn't matter.
I'm just here to work the mine. Nothing else matters anymore.
I'm just trying to make a living. I've no interest in trouble.
Sorli and I are just here to make sure the mine is run proper.
It's good that Sorli has finally been given some real authority.
Stonehills' warmth is a welcome change in this cold, bleak land.
The mine gives us purpose. Something many of us have wished for.
I'll see to it that Sorli is safe now that she's running Morthal.
I spend every waking moment making sure the mine is put to good use.
This is not where Teeba-Ei was meant to live out the rest of his days.
The outside world means little to us, and we'd like it to stay that way.
My parents keep a close eye on the miners. They can't be trusted too much.
We left Sirgar in charge back at Stonehills. I hope that wasn't a mistake.
We've got all the miners we need, so I hope you're not here looking for work.
You get used to the cold after a while. The harder you work, the warmer you stay.
When you work hard enough, really get into a rhythm, everything else just fades away.
I figured that I would run the mine someday. I just didn't figure that would mean now.
Bryling owns this mine. I wouldn't have much to live for if she hadn't offered me a job.
Wouldn't ever have expected to wind up living in a place like this, but the money's good.
Pactur and I, we make sure the miners aren't stealing, and that the ore makes it to Solitude.
I hear there's been fighting in Skyrim. Rebellion, maybe. Wonder if our iron is being used for weapons.
Teeba-Ei the hatchling never imagined working a mine in this cold place. Greater things were dreamt of.
Guess the Empire's going to need plenty of iron what with all the fighting. That'll be good for us, I suppose.
Hjaalmarch isn't much, but it's a good start. I'll make a name for myself here, then maybe work my way up to someplace like Riften.
If you're here about the mine -- it's already got an owner, and she's not selling. If not, then please stay out of my workers' way.
Tell Shadr I'm forgetting about his debt.
Ha ha! Are you kidding me? I've got the entire Thieves Guild at my back. What've you got?
All right, all right! Take it easy. No idea why you'd care about a stranger so much, but this isn't worth a fight.
Ten more would keep me stocked for a bit.
Bring me another seven of them, if you can.
I need at least five more, if you can find them.
If you can bring me three more, that would be helpful.
That's a decent weapon you've made there.
That's some good armor you've put together.
Masterful. That's a work of art, right there.
Good job. I can see you know what you're doing.
Not bad. Reminds me when I first started smithing.
You made that from the remains of a dragon? Amazing.
Not too shabby. Apprentice level work, but solid. Keep at it.
You don't see many people crafting with that these days. Impressive.
That's a fine potion you've put together.
An excellent elixir. Your technique shows a command of the alchemical art.
You've brewed a truly vile poison there. I pity the beast that tastes that.
You've produced a rarefied solution there, an infusion of pure essences. Artfully done.
That's a good concoction. But keep trying new things. Alchemy rewards inquisitive minds.
An [QUOTE]interesting[QUOTE] mixture... Keep experimenting. You'll improve with practice.
They're crazy. Think they rule the Reach.
That answer your damn questions? Now get out.
Well guess who really runs things around here? Me. I own the mines. I make the coin pass to the right hands.
Think I'm defenseless? Well you're wrong!
This should compensate you for your find.
Troll's blood, what happened to you Pavo?
The Forsworn have taken Kolskeggr Mine. We're the only ones left.
Gods.... You two head inside and get some rest. I'll send word to the Jarl.
Until then, we have quite the task ahead.
Then it's decided. When this entire sorry affair is over, we'll handle the details.
Then it's decided. When this is all over and Delvin's contacts assure me that we've regained our footing in Skyrim, we'll handle the details.
We have a relationship of mutual respect.
I care little about the politics and rivalries between the Thalmor and the Empire.
But I do respect power, and the Thalmor have that. They leave me alone, and I leave them alone.
What? You did? Oh sweet Divines! You did!
There is no way I can pay you what this Lute is worth. But I can teach you a few tricks I've learned over the years.
Who else gains from that but the Thalmor?
Nothing solid. Yet. But my gut tells me it can't be anybody else.
And now the dragons are attacking everywhere, indiscriminately. Skyrim is weakened, the Empire is weakened.
The Empire had captured Ulfric. The war was basically over. Then a dragon attacks, Ulfric escapes, and the war is back on.
Who knows, maybe he's in a generous mood.
I've already given you a job, now get to it.
Aren't you already running a job for Aela? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
Aren't you already running a job for Skjor? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
Aren't you already running a job for Farkas? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
Aren't you already running a job for Vilkas? Come talk to me when you finish that up.
Kodlak is the one who figures out who can be a Companion. So talk to him. It's out of my hands.
So you think you have what it takes? Huh. Lucky for you, I'm not the one who makes that decision. Talk to Kodlak.
We don't just take in any milk drinker who stumbles in. Talk to Kodlak if you think you have what it takes to be a Companion.
I don't know if you're capable, and I don't have time to find out. If Kodlak will vouch for you, I might have some work you could do.
Yeah. Threw it in the lake like you said.
Dirge! Did you take out the trash like I asked?
Tell me you looked through the trash before you did that.
Take it easy, Vekel. How long we known each other? Yeah. I checked it. All the stuff is in the safe.
Yeah... fired. Sure. That's what I meant.
Yes, I think you'll be just what I need.
Yes, quite a shame. It was a fine weapon.
You are human again. Like the rest of us.
You damn gray-skin. Go back to Morrowind!
You a fighting man? How about a little bet?
You a fighting girl? How about a little bet?
I'm the best warrior in Morthal, and that's no boast.
Think you can go blade to blade with me? You'd be dead in six seconds.
You. You a Dark Elf lover? Get out of our city, you filthy piece of trash.
You made your decision. Now live with it.
You may as well give up, I see you there.
Following me, huh? You're not very good at this are you?
You weren't. There's just not much to it.
I see. You're a good soldier, Horik. I'm sorry for intruding.
What's to say? I was born on a farm, joined the Legion when I came of age, and I've served you ever since.
No. Can't say there was. My parents died when I was young. You and the Legion have been my only family since.
What about your family? There must have been someone waiting for you back at the farm. Wondering if you were ever coming home?
You never talk much about yourself, do you Horik? I swear, these past 30 years you've been at my side, and I think I barely know you.
You will be my blood offering to Morvath!
You've done it. The shrine is ours again.
Now we need to prepare a grand feast to welcome you to Namira's coven.
You will have the honor of bringing a fresh kill for the main course. And I know the perfect person.
A tragic, and very, very profitable event.
Turn me in? For what? What crime's been committed? I'm just making idle talk about what would most undoubtedly be a tragic event...
Alive.... You're alive... Thank Sithis...
All right, then. We'll get together later.
And a Nord knows a liar when she sees one.
Matter of fact, I do. They've been fair enough with me, far as I can tell.
Are you all right? What happened in there?
Are you one of them? Please don't hurt me.
Please, open the door. I need to get out of here.
Are you worried the Forsworn might return?
I doubt the Forsworn would risk holding this mine a second time. They lost many of their warriors.
As of yet, there has been no sign of them.
He would ask that it please not happen again.
The College has developed some theories, however.
Firstly, the ability to repel the undead cannot be ignored.
While there is no direct evidence of this, it does seem likely.
An array so great, in fact, that it remains a source of curiosity.
But more importantly, wards have saved lives. This is a simple fact.
They are counted upon every bit as much as Candlelight, or Invisibility.
Work continues on the Eye of Magnus, as it has been commonly referred to.
Say as little as possible so as to avoid compromising our neutral position.
None, however, exactly match the markings or distribution of Skyrim's stones.
They focus on research banned by the Synod, such as Conjuration and Necromancy.
Please refrain from practicing Conjuration spells in view of the town of Winterhold.
Falling in with either would threaten to draw much unwanted attention to our College.
References to similar stones appear in lore throughout the various Tamrielic cultures.
While the idea seems dubious at best, it has not, at present, been entirely ruled out.
As many know, there is an ongoing effort to research the work of the Archmagus Shalidor.
At this time, I would like to make a few statements regarding policy here at the College.
The prevailing opinion of Skyrim natives is that the stones are indeed magical in nature.
Every mage in this College regularly uses wards for practice, so as to avoid physical harm.
Also, their placement throughout Skyrim does not correspond to any known magical phenomenon.
Once again, I must ask that everyone please clean up any materials used in the common areas.
It has been proposed that the object is in fact the entirety of Aurbis in one physical space.
At this time, there is no indication that either group is aware of the other's correspondence.
It further suggests that we are somehow then outside our own existence while looking in at it.
Projects are underway to discern the origin and nature of the College's recent find in Saarthal.
Skyrim is well known to be full of these... Draugr, ancient Nord warriors who cannot find peace.
The College of Whispers hopes to learn that our College also supports these avenues of research.
They appear to have little interest in real study and research for the sake of gaining knowledge.
Likewise, the College of Whispers has long been driven by its desire to directly oppose the Synod.
Increased his intelligence and knowledge in ways unfathomable to us? We may never know for certain.
I would just like to remind everyone, once again, that Restoration is indeed a valid school of magic.
This would of course mean that Tamriel, indeed all of Mundus, is actually contained within the sphere.
Any information as to the whereabouts of the previous group of Apprentices would be greatly appreciated.
At present, these two groups do little beyond attempting to gain the attention and favor of the Emperor.
We know that Shalidor had an understanding of magic that surpassed almost any of either his age or ours.
Any and all theories are currently being considered. Those with ideas should please speak with Mirabelle.
Atronachs have a tendency to frighten the locals. Undead.... well, I don't even think it needs to be said.
At present, there is no confirmation of any of the various theories surrounding the nature of these stones.
Their relative positions do not indicate that any individual stone is part of a larger, unobserved pattern.
This goes quite against College policy, and the party responsible is advised to cease these actions at once.
Secondly, how can anyone forget wards? They have become essential to any mage working in dangerous situations.
Thus they may claim that the Synod is indeed a political minority in the Empire and should be treated as such.
What is interesting is that it appears he was also incredibly prolific, writing on a diverse array of subjects.
No more experiments are to be carried out there, and mages are advised that you enter the Midden at your own risk.
Arch-Mage Aren believed that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur.
Arch-Mage Aren believes that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur.
Anyone suggesting that Restoration is better left to the priests of the Temples, I think, is forgetting a few things.
He is most remembered for his great maze of Labyrinthian, said to hold [QUOTE]Glamoril[QUOTE], or the secret of life.
He has suggested that, should he find out who is responsible, he is well versed in making things disappear permanently.
If this is impossible due to misuse or accident, Urag recommends finding a replacement copy to deliver to the Arcanaeum.
Nonetheless, many are drawn to these stones based on the local stories describing them as a source of significant power.
While Drevis appreciates the spellcasting skill that went into somehow cramming several hundred apples into his pillow...
It is entirely possible that they look to our College here in Winterhold in order to find supporters for their organization.
Aren believed that although the initial communications were innocent enough, they were sent with a particular motive in mind.
The Synod's harsh rules and draconian structure are maintained only by suppressing any opposition to their Council's policies.
Is it possible that it somehow contributed to his work? Perhaps allowed him to life multiple lifetimes in a short span of time?
It is absolutely worthy of research, despite many of the notes I've had left in my bed. And my desk. And on occasion, my meals.
We've had yet another sprained ankle due to soul gems being left on the floor. Let's please try and keep injuries to a minimum.
Writings from that period, including those of Ysgramor himself, do not mention the stones and thus this idea cannot be verified.
What, then, of this Glamoril? It means [QUOTE]secret of life[QUOTE] in elvish. Could this be an explanation for Shalidor's works?
At this time, there is no indication that, as has been rumored, the object is in fact a physical part of Magnus, the god of magic.
I truly hope that these points actually sink in, and that more care and thought is given to this subject in the future. Thank you.
Failure to do so will result in paying, in Urag's words, [QUOTE]a blood price.[QUOTE] I did not ask him to elaborate on that point.
The College will continue to research these intriguing objects, and of course any findings will be relayed with all possible haste.
The Midden remains off-limits at this time; while the initial outbreak has been cleaned up, the area is still considered hazardous.
It has been suggested that the object is a gateway to the realm of Aetherius, but nothing has proven that idea one way or the other.
I submit that everyone in this College has, at one time or another, relied on one of the Restoration spells that can keep them at bay.
Indeed, it has been jokingly suggested that we send the exact same response to both, which each will warp into support for their side.
The College of Winterhold has thus far declined requests for direct meetings. This has been at the specific request of Arch-Mage Aren.
The few works of his that have been recovered suggest that he had an understanding of magic and the world that few have ever achieved.
There have been unconfirmed reports that someone has been sneaking into the town of Winterhold while invisible, and causing... issues.
Urag has asked me to remind everyone to please return materials borrowed from the Arcanaeum in the same condition as you received them.
The existence of so-called [QUOTE]Doomstones[QUOTE] throughout Skyrim has been repeatedly verified. The meaning of these stones has not.
If either group goes through less official channels and attempt to contact you directly, please refer them to the College's Master Wizard.
The age of the stones themselves has yet to be officially determined. It has been widely assumed that they were placed during the Merethic Era.
It is no secret that both the Synod and the College of Whispers have recently made inquiries as to the status of our College here in Winterhold.
The College is always searching for more of Shalidor's writings in an attempt to understand both our knowledge of the man, and of magic in general.
While stories have persisted since the First Era, none have ever confirmed the existence of this [QUOTE]Glamoril[QUOTE] or its purpose or function.
Our actual position and policies are irrelevant. No matter the facts of the response, it will certainly be twisted to suit the whims of either group.
But to invade my home, kidnap my family...
I suspect Brurid planned this, there's been bad blood between us since the king's death.
Come on, what are trying to do? Insult me?
Well, can't say exactly where the mold is, but something does spring to mind.
Think I'm going to head out now. Take a long vacation from woodcutting, you know? Good luck.
It seems there's this strange button on the wall opposite the fireplace in my house. Always wondered what it was for.
Damn it! Sorry. I'm not very good at this.
Look, just don't say anything to Maven, will you? I've spent weeks trying to get that right and if she sees how stupid I am, she'll get rid of me.
Drem. Patience. I am answering, in my way.
Find out why he's here, and what he wants.
Fine. I won't ask questions. Cut me loose.
You think it's money I need? I'm a prisoner, not a beggar.
Get in good with them and you'll find her.
Do I look like a merchant to you? You're going to have to take that up with Vex in the Thieves Guild.
Good. Here, take the key to the warehouse.
Excellent. Here, this is the key to the warehouse.
Pay dear old Sarthis a visit and tell him Maven sends her regards, would you?
See if you can drop in on this dealer of poison and convince him to close down his operation permanently.
Good. I have your invitation to the party.
Which means you need to look the part, and not be armed to the teeth. Here, put this on.
But the only way you're going to get past the guards is if they really believe you're an invited guest.
Haelga, we need to stop seeing each other.
Is it really me, or is it your wife? You need to make a choice Bolli. The honey or her.
Oh, Bolli you silly man. You weren't saying that when you were licking that honey off my...
Haelga! That's just it. I can't keep up with you. Your Dibellan techniques... they're exhausting.
Here, take this - it's called Jarrin Root.
Now go, my friend. Go, and fulfill your destiny as Listener.
All it takes is one taste, and the effects are quite immediate. The Emperor will be serving Sithis before he even knows he's dead.
Once Mede has been killed, escape through the upper door, and across the bridge. I've [QUOTE]arranged[QUOTE] for it to be unguarded once the alarm is sounded.
Here. Some of my best armor. Wear it well.
Good. I'd prefer using water to cool my metal, but it's what the Jarl wants.
I can't believe it. You have them already?
Why don't you head back out to Yngvild and find the rest?
Here, take this. This should cover your end of the work nicely.
It's a good start, but you need all four of the volumes or the set isn't complete.
I don't think that's how the Circle works.
They're lording it over us all the time, though.
Young warriors are smart to listen to older ones. They've lived.
One day when you and I are on the Circle, we can change how things are run around here.
I don't want that coming back to haunt me.
Well, yes. I was completely unaware of the reputation of the other party in this trade.
I guess that comes down to footwork, then.
Should I be holding the blade further away than I would a smaller one?
If you keep it in close, you'll have more control, but it can be harder to balance a strike.
Exactly. When you have a big heavy weight swinging around your upper body, your lower body has to compensate or you'll fall right over.
I joined up with them maybe ten years ago.
Small clan... maybe twenty men. We'd raid villages, rob caravans... but it was always about the killing for them.
I... I think I need to stop talking now...
I think Aldis understands. I don't think I could have stayed here if anyone else had...
Then like Roggvir, you're a Nord at heart. It's hard for many of the people here to understand.
I'll throw some money at you. Good enough?
Just get the notes and bring them to me. If you can't do it, I'll find some other way to manage it.
I'm afraid we're well beyond pleasantries.
Oh, now we're all please and thank you, are we?
I'll allow you the opportunity to turn around, walk out that door, and never come back. I suggest you move quickly.
I'm one of the last members of the Blades.
Now that dragons are coming back, our purpose is clear again. We need to stop them.
A very long time ago, the Blades were dragonslayers, and we served the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer.
For the last two hundred years, since the last Dragonborn emperor, the Blades have been searching for a purpose.
If that's what it will take then so be it.
You've changed, brother. And not for the better I'm afraid.
You've done what you've had to for yourself, not for mother.
I've done what I needed to do keep mother happy. It doesn't matter what I really believe.
What's become of us? We used to be inseparable... always fighting back to back and letting nothing stand in our way.
So, is this what it's come to? You'd have your own flesh and blood hanged just to solidify your grip as the next Jarl?
Wise up, Harrald. There's a storm on the horizon and it will blow through here with all its fury. It's time to choose a side.
If you change your mind, seek me out here.
Infos conditioned on Attack Delta go here.
It makes me sad whenever I think about it.
It's been better, I'll be honest with you.
Here, let me get you some mead. This one's on me.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is everything all right?
Oh, Jora. Good to see you. I was wondering if you might ask Lortheim something for me.
Don't bother. I don't have much chance of seeing my husband these days. He's always up in the palace with Ulfric.
Killing dragons isn't defending the Reach?
Our men know how to kill Forsworn and Legionnaires, not dragons.
We can't do that. Every soldier we send to hunt dragons is one more man that can't defend the Reach.
I want soldiers sent to deal with these dragons. Every able-bodied man and woman who can carry a bow.
Let me think... what were they working on?
I hadn't really considered it in terms of time. I suppose it's been at least a month.
Let's see his eminence try to ignore this.
Ha ha! The news is everywhere! Vittoria Vici, the Emperor's cousin, butchered at her own wedding! Well done!
Look, did you want the information or not?
Give Mercer my regards when you return to Riften.
Now you won't forget to tell Mercer I cooperated, will you?
Do take care handling that case of wine... it's irreplaceable.
Good luck in Solitude. Keep Gulum-Ei alive, but remind him who we are.
If you're the best the Guild's got, they're in worse shape than I imagined.
I need you to put all your efforts into this job. We can't afford any mistakes.
Madanach. I've brought what you asked for.
Good work. Get ready while I have a word with our favorite outsider.
Your family? You've poisoned the Reach with your tainted silver for long enough, Thonar!
Madanach! Think you can escape my prison do you? You'll pay for what you've done to my family!
May your will carve itself upon the world.
My father doesn't know anything about me.
But I know about him. And about the war. More than he might think.
So the disgusting pig sent you to bother me? One day, I'll tear his face apart so he can leave me alone.
Narri, do you think the war will ever end?
But what about the banning of Talos worship? Isn't that worth fighting about?
I think the war is just an excuse. If it does end there will be a new reason and a new place.
I don't know about you, tekla, but all my prayers are silent and who I pray to is still my own to decide.
No, and before you ask, it's not for sale.
Not many come to see me. What do you want?
Nothing but foul deeds behind those walls.
Stay clear of that College, if you know what's good for you.
Now thanks to you I needn't worry anymore.
Gods, I've lost count of the days. It feels like an age has passed.
I wish I could believe that I'd have held out forever against their torture, but I can't be so sure.
Now, stand aside, there's work to be done.
Remember, speak only to Enthir. Trust no one else.
I hope you enjoy touring the museum. Just don't touch anything.
If you have further need of me, you can find me in the College.
Calcelmo is stubborn as a mule. Be careful when you speak to him.
Oh, be certain to purchase my Falmer translation tome when it's completed!
Try not to disturb me in the future, I'm in the midst of groundbreaking research!
Oh no! They've found me? I need your help!
Please, come with me. I need to speak to you privately.
The who? I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, of course. Mother needs me, after all.
Yes, Listener. I'll be here if you need me.
Of course. But if you need me, just give the order.
I will return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary immediately, Listener.
Yes, Listener. I'll return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary without delay.
Home again, home again! I'll return to the Night Mother straightaway!
Purpose? I should think it's self-evident.
It shapes worlds, creates and destroys life... It deserves proper respect and study.
The College is a place where we can focus on that, without the pressures of the world weighing down on us.
Magic is a true power, not something to be shunned by commoners or treated as an amusing diversion by politicians.
Really? I dunno... I don't feel invisible.
See what a warrior of true mettle is like.
Well nobody asked you. If you think you're better than we are, go talk to Kodlak Whitemane.
She's dead! On my watch! This won't stand!
I'm just here to provide protection for his eminence's cousin. Please, enjoy yourself.
Should have figured Astrid would send you.
Do me a favor and kill that little jester twice. Just to make sure.
So that's my sad story. What do you think?
I never returned to that pig farm you know. There's nothing for me there.
Over time, I managed to gain their confidence. Then one night I grabbed a knife, waited until they fell asleep and cut their throats.
So, Talen. Have you reconsidered my offer?
Sorry Hemming, I've no interest in becoming your valet.
What's the matter, I thought you people were used to indentured servitude.
Xhuth! Black-Briar or not, say that again and so help me you're going to need more than your mother to protect you from me.
Somethin' ya need? Anything for the guild.
Ah, now you must be lost. Best ya scurry off while you're able. The Ratway, well, it has a habit of swallowin' up the uninvited.
Sorry, Tythis. I'll get it to you somehow.
Just give me a few more days and I promise I'll come up with it.
Niluva, you promised me you'd pay me back yesterday. So what's the story?
If you'd stop wasting your coin on that skooma, you'd have enough gold to live on.
Step into the light, and your test begins.
Take care, stranger. Be careful out there.
Let's see if I can teach you a few things about using a bow.
It was nice to spend time with someone who enjoys archery as much as I do.
Remember, composure and speed. You don't need to see your arrow hit before moving onto your next target. Trust your shot is true.
That's a sensible lad. Now fetch me drink.
Uh, right. Maybe just one of the popular songs, like [QUOTE]The Slaying of the Falmer Princes[QUOTE]?
Playing tonight, Ogmund? Everyone here is anxious to hear the old ballads performed by the True Skald of the Reach.
Son, I know thousands of the old ballads. If I played all of them, everyone in this inn would be as grey as I am before I finished.
The enemy is mustering for a final attack.
The sooner I get out of Skyrim the better.
Look, I've moved all over Skyrim selling these bits of junk and I'm barely scraping by.
I'm not out to win friends and I could care less if you're happy about your purchase or not. I just need the coin.
Then by all means, go about your business.
There is no point in further talk. Go now!
Go. Tell your commanders you have won. I, my family, and my men will be gone before they arrive.
This... This is really from her, isn't it?
Did she really run off and do this? For me?
Please, leave me alone. I need to be by myself.
I... I have some thinking to do. Thank you for this.
By the Eight. She's dead, isn't she? And it's all my fault.
True, he didn't stand a chance against me.
His father before him perhaps, but not Torygg.
But that was precisely the point! He was a puppet-king of the Empire , not a High King of Skyrim.
He was too privileged and too foolish, more interested in entertaining his queen than ruling his country.
I challenged him in the traditional way, and he accepted. There were many witnesses. No [QUOTE]murder[QUOTE] was committed.
Very funny. Did Enthir put you up to this?
We just need the hilt and the pommel, now.
We just need the shards of the blade and the hilt, now.
We just need the pommel and the shards of the blade, now.
There's only the hilt left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?
There's only the pommel left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?
There's only the shards of the blade left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?
Finally, all the pieces of Mehrunes' Razor are in my hands. It's time I let you in on something.
There's a fourth piece. That scabbard in the display case. Built to house the Razor. And there's more.
I know how to put all the pieces together. We just need to take them to Dagon's shrine and contact the Lord of Change directly.
We'll be waiting to take her into custody.
I'll gladly share a portion of the bounty in return for your efforts in seeing proper justice done.
Convince her that we'll be coming for her, and she needs to leave. Lead her to the stables outside Whiterun.
She trusts you, at least to some extent. She sent you after us, and has no reason to think that you'd do anything other than that.
We'll handle things from here. Move along.
Well, there's an Imbuer in the Great Hall.
Well, there's an Imbuer here in the Great Hall.
Well? Grelod the Kind. Is she... you know?
Where is papa? I want to ride Karinda now!
Have I done something to make you bother me?
You're going to end up helping me. I know it.
Kind of nice being in on the secret, itsn't it.
Another wanderer, here to lick my father's boots. Good job.
One of the new servants? Remember that I like my meat rare.
You... you know the Whispering Lady, don't you. I can tell.
You're not from around here. I'll bet you're here to help with the war!
Absurd that you can't get good sweet rolls in this skeeverhole of a city.
Hope this war lasts long enough that I get to fight in it. Battle! Glory!
The only grownups who talk to me are the kind I don't want talking to me.
Blasted war. I was due a new dress from Solitude, but it will never get here.
Father says I'm too young to train with a sword, so I practice with my fists!
Why is this suddenly so important, anyway?
If you're getting involved in this, that'd be where you start looking.
With good planning and constant vigilance.
Until brave heroes step forward to destroy these monsters, that is the best we can do.
We must have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack.
We must also have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack.
Even now, my court wizard, Farengar, continues his research into ways we might drive back these terrors.
But our greatest weapon? Courage. For if we cannot kill the beast, we must at least have the tenacity to drive it back.
You weren't ready. You still aren't ready.
But thanks to the Blades, you now have questions that only Paarthurnax can answer.
You've gathered quite a few of them I see.
I'll search through Sinderion's notes and find some more information about the Crimson Nirnroot and its properties.
A citizen of Skyrim has asked for our help.
A citizen of the Pale has asked for our help.
A citizen of the Rift has asked for our help.
A citizen of Whiterun has asked for our help.
A citizen of Eastmarch has asked for our help.
A citizen of Falkreath has asked for our help.
A citizen of Haafingar has asked for our help.
A citizen of the Reach has asked for our help.
A citizen of Hjaalmarch has asked for our help.
A citizen of Winterhold has asked for our help.
And if not, may she drown in her own tears.
Couldn't they understand that I was used? That I was grieving for Friga, too? No... they treated me like garbage, threw me away.
With Nilsine dead, maybe then Tova will realize what she's lost, hmm? Maybe then she'll see that I was just as much a daughter as the others.
Don't you see? I was like a daughter to Tova. A sister to Nilsine and Friga. But the family refuses to believe my innocence. No matter what I say.
And... here. I suppose you've earned these.
Well, well. And you seem to be in one piece!
Thank you. I'll look these over, and inform Mirabelle if I find anything relevant.
[QUOTE]Night of Tears[QUOTE], eh? I remember this one. Well, isn't that interesting.
Did you read it yourself? If I recall it correctly, that has some interesting implications. You should mention that to Tolfdir.
Anyway, here is your reward.  Thanks again.
Awww. And here I thought you could do it...
Well, I'll just have to think of something else then. Bye.
Bassianus is still so terrified of Jofthor.
Let him know that I'll watch out for them. I just want my daughter to be happy.
If he knew that I'd keep him from hunting the poor boy down, he'd take Fastred to Riften without a second thought.
Because I was clumsy enough to be captured.
Kematu always says we're supposed to be the best of the best. I wasn't.
Best not to walk the roads of Skyrim alone.
Watch your back, friend. Better yet, pay me to do it for you.
Walk always in shadows, so that you will see your foes before they see you.
The blade can be as lethal as the spell, but deadlier still is the one who wields both!
Why settle for just stabbing your foes when you can roast them alive in a gout of arcane fire?
Did I ask you to? Did you hear me say that?
Did you have any luck talking to my father?
If you need a meal or a room, I've got both.
If you beat up my sister Sissel, I won't tell.
I got enough troubles, so don't go adding to them.
You talk to Reldith yet? She's like a mother to me.
I only take real coin here, no handouts and no bartering.
I wish I could be an adventurer like you, and go wherever I want.
Sissel thinks she's so special. No way she's more special than me.
I hope you can change my father's mind. He can be a little stubborn.
If you're thinking of setting up to farm, you picked the right place.
No offense intended, but I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Peace and prosperity are all the good folk of Rorikstead want in life.
We're honest, hardworking folk here, and we don't suffer beggars or thieves.
Did you see those guards? Get out of line, and you'll have them to deal with.
Do yourself a favor and don't have children. They're good for nothing at all.
Are you new around here? You should go to the inn if you need a place to stay.
You here from the city? I visit Whiterun from time to time, mostly to make deals.
If you've got some business in Rorikstead, you should start by speaking to Jouane.
Name's Ennis. If you've got friends who do business in Whiterun, they might know me.
I had a dream that there was a good dragon. He was old and gray, but he wasn't scary.
Some day soon I'll stop being afraid. Jouane is teaching me magic. He says I'm real good.
I'm the older sister, by nearly five minutes. Sissel's barely worthy to walk in my shadow.
My father, Mralki, manages the inn. He used to be a soldier, but he left that life behind.
Reldith is the hardest-working farmer in Rorikstead, but I'm the one with a head for business.
I'm sure it's hard to believe, but I was once a bold adventurer like you, ready to face any danger.
I was a different man, once -- strong, commanding, ah, and young. But the Great War was a long time ago.
You look like the adventurous sort. You should talk to Erik, the innkeeper's son. He could use your help.
Most days, I do all I can to stay away from my sister and my father. The beating's the same from either one.
Have you spoken to Erik? His father won't let him go out and seek his fortune in the world. Maybe you can help.
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude but Jouane's the one who deals with people. I'm afraid I lost my charm years ago.
Do enjoy your time in Rorikstead. This close to the Reach, well, we are truly blessed to have such fertile ground.
You look like you've seen your share of adventure. I envy you that. In fact, maybe you can help me with something.
City folk might look down on us, but what's wrong with farming? Everything we've got, we had to earn with our own sweat.
I spend every day tending the fields, and what do my daughters do? Nothing! Complain and caterwaul! Sleep and eat! Useless!
Some folk here will tell you I'm sheltering my boy too much, but I ask you, isn't it a father's duty to keep his children safe?
That fool son of mine, Erik, wants to be an adventurer. He a good-natured lad, but he's got no idea how dangerous the world really is.
Curse my good-for-nothing daughters! My wife was twice the woman they'll ever grow to be. She gave her life birthing them. What a waste.
Did you read that letter from Markarth yet?
And how is that old warrior doing these days?
Oh dear. I wish there was something we could do to help him.
Not well. He's convinced that his house is haunted, so he's sleeping on the street.
As do I. That man saved my life. I hope that someone helps him, as he once helped me.
Yes, just this morning. It was from Logrolf. He wrote to thank us for the food we sent.
Excellent. They should be ready for us now.
I'll carry the stew pot, and lead the way up to the dining room. I'm sure the Emperor and his guests are dying to meet you.
And if I may say so... it has been an honor, getting a chance to prepare a meal with, well... the best chef in the entire Empire.
Fight well, or die well. Talos be with you!
Gleda! And not a scratch on her! Happy day!
Only bit I could make out was [QUOTE]repaying Ysolda in Whiterun,[QUOTE] and even that's mostly scribbles. Guess you could try there.
I still can't figure out why you stole her. You left a note explaining it, but half of it was gibberish and the rest had mead spilled on it.
Good. Did she say anything we need to know?
That she did. Very good. I'll tell Brynjolf.
Job's done, boss. Gave the package to her just you said.
Yep. She said that the Jarl was planning a surprise raid on us, but she talked her out of it. Said she saved us a lot of trouble.
Ha. Sure you did. Dagur put you up to this?
It don't matter now. None of it does. Just leave me be.
He was supposed to keep them under control.
They're my puppets. I have their [QUOTE]king[QUOTE] rotting in Cidhna Mine.
Here, take your gold and leave me in peace.
All right! I get it. I'll pay on time from now on. Just don't smash anything else.
Here's the name and location of the client.
All right. Be quick about it, will you? This is a good way for the College to bring in some money.
I can't wait to see what the future brings.
I'll follow you till I'm dust in the breeze. You do realize that?
You know, I like it here. We should have moved to Dawnstar ages ago.
This place is already starting to feel like home. Must be all the bloodstains.
I don't know. Are you not listening at all?
It was a simple task, so I didn't keep close tabs on it like I do with the dangerous stuff.
I hope so. I can't stand this city anymore.
Don't worry, the time will come when we can walk away from here.
Damn it, Talen. We still don't have enough this year to get out of Riften.
I know I don't like the way he looks at me.
I know he's from the Thalmor, and that he claims to be here simply as an advisor.
I also know that no one really believes that. I've been trying to avoid him, honestly.
I can't tell if he expects me to blow myself up, or to try and murder him. But he clearly doesn't trust any of us.
I see no harm in it, if you have the skill.
If you've got the raw materials, you can use the forge to make something new.
The grindstone will improve your weapons. Use the table to improve your armor.
I'll show you to your room. Right this way.
Let me know if there's anything else you need.
I'm eleven years old, and I could take you.
Someday I'm going to kill a dragon all by myself.
I'm ready when you are. Just give the word.
I'll be at the market come morning. You better be there too.
I've looked after her safety for so long...
She's so lost in her visions, and it's only getting worse.
If she can't tell what's real and what's not, how will she continue to lead Hjaalmarch?
If the river is not frozen to ice, perhaps.
Soon it will be time to replenish our supply of water.
The road takes us past many cold rivers. We can fill our skins there.
It's almost all I have time for these days.
These days? Aye. Most of what I make is for folk like you.
The men training here in Solitude and the troops out in the field, they all need weapons and armor.
It's clear that memories are far too short.
And it's clear money matters more to Dagur than honor.
This is what it's come to. No one seems to care what they've done to our home.
That... wizard is still at the Inn. I can't believe Dagur allows him to stay there.
J'zargo sees what you are up to. Very well.
Let me see if I can find the right panel...
Ah. Of course. Not everyone has an appreciation for the artistic wonders of the world.
Maybe I will. What do you think about that?
I'm warning you. Those people are killers. You'd never last a day with them.
You're always talking about the Forsworn. You aren't thinking of joining them, are you?
My beacon is sure to attract a worthy soul.
But if you are wise, you will heed my bidding.
But a single candle can banish the darkness of the entire Void. If not you, then someone else.
No, nothing. At least nothing I'm aware of.
Obeying the Night Mother. You being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense.
Well... If I'm being honest, I haven't exactly been discreet lately in expressing my frustration with this whole situation.
But to go this far. To attempt to murder the leader of a Sanctuary. Cicero must pay with his life. There is no other option.
Cicero may have overheard me talking to one of the others about the Night Mother. It's possible I was... not entirely respectful.
No! Not again! I shall not be denied again!
Not yet, anyway, though it certainly could.
The best we can hope for a swift end to the conflict. The longer the war goes on, the worse it will be for all for us, I'm afraid.
With most of the hold's fighting men committed to the war, there are fewer swords to keep the roads safe from brigands and wild beasts.
And of course, as the war drags on and supplies run low, our ample fields and stores of food will make a tempting target for desperate men.
Nothing to say. Fine, but I'm watching you.
Now, there's no need to do anything rash...
This isn't as bad as it seems. I was going to tell Mercer about everything, honestly! Please... he'll have me killed!
Of course, not as many pilgrims these days.
This is the Gildergreen. It was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun.
This is the Temple of Kynareth. The Gildergreen, outside, was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun.
Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches.
Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches. They built the temple.
The Gildergreen, yes. It's a bit of an eyesore at the moment. More of a problem for the pilgrims than for me, but not many of them around anymore.
Of course! You don't remember getting here.
Okay, okay. No need to make rash decisions.
Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done.
Yell all you want. It's not going to change my mind.
On the cosmological scale, it's all nearby.
Well, here as in this plane. Mundus. Tamriel. Nearby, relatively speaking.
One of the fiercest battles I've ever seen.
Please, our tribe suffers and we need help.
Running a little light in the pockets, lad?
Running a little light in the pockets, lass?
Glad to see you finally came to to your senses. Ready to make some coin?
Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're carrying, eh lad?
Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're carrying, eh lass?
See? I knew Aren wouldn't leave me in here!
Hurry and get me out of this cage before they come for me!
So you are alive. I was starting to wonder.
Come on! We've got to find a way out of here!
Look for a way out! We are not going to burn to death in our own damned Sanctuary!
So you were right. Go tell the Jarl. Hurry!
So, any luck finding my louse of a husband?
I can't believe my mother's gone. Now what'll I do?
Men are utter pigs... they only care about one thing.
Someday I'll take over the mill... when I'm old enough.
You men are utter pigs... you only care about one thing.
I knew it! I knew my father was a hero and he didn't just run away.
I hope you're not here to start some trouble. I'll fight you if I have to.
Millwork sure is boring, but at least I don't have to work in a nasty mine.
Despite what you discovered it's still comforting to know my husband is at peace.
If I ever catch my husband in bed with another woman, he's going to find himself homeless.
I'm not afraid of anyone. Put a sword in my hand and I could defend this place if I had to!
My mother taught me the millwork trade... you know, which trees to cut and which ones to pass up.
It's just me and my mother at the mill here. My father is gone. We don't know what happened to him.
Men are complete pigs, am I right? All they care about is one thing... and you know exactly what I mean.
Hmph. If you see my good-for-nothing husband Leifnarr on your journeys tell him he's no longer welcome here.
Sorry. You already have an animal with you.
War dogs cost gold, friend. Come back when you have some.
Good. Here you are. He'll follow you to Oblivion and back, if it comes to that.
Take out Haldyn, and we'll handle the rest.
So if you're willing to perform one more service for the Company, we could put this matter behind us for good.
You've shown yourself useful so far. All these lunks are too afraid of Haldyn to head in before the fog's cleared.
Thanks, I was actually worried I'd run out.
That's a load off my mind. Here's your pay.
Now that's good work. Everyone will be a lot safer with them gone, Dark Elf and Nord alike.
Now I've got the itch to travel again. If you're leaving town, I wouldn't mind coming with for a while.
Here, some gold as promised, and let me show you a bit about wearing heavy armor. Save you some aches on a long march.
You remind me of myself a few years ago. Let me show you a little bit about wearing light armor. It's helped me out whenever I was scouting.
That's just what Ulfric wants you to think.
If that's what you really believe, then you're a fool. Never had much patience for fools, myself.
That's not funny, Bolli. People are scared.
Talen my friend, up for some fishing this week?
I don't know Bolli. It's getting dangerous outside the walls.
Oh come now, what's a dragon or two compared to a day full of fishing!
The name of the person you want is Karliah.
I see you wish to be reasonable, perhaps I misjudged you.
The old man trusted you, so I'll trust you.
I'll be honest, I wouldn't have expected it.
Let's hope you can show that his heart was not deceived. Good luck, my friend.
But I've seen what you can do. And heard of the love that Kodlak had for you. The trust.
But that may just be because I remember when you were just a whelp who was begging to join.
Oh, you don't have to worry about any problems from me. I do what I'm told. Congratulations!
If you had told me a few months ago that some outsider I had never heard of would lead the Companions, I might have slit your throat.
There will be. Of that, you can be assured.
Think the guards will be coming down, soon?
Ah, it's not been more than a few days since they came down the last time.
Thorald can't be left to those... monsters.
I'll do anything if it means saving my brother. You'll join us, won't you?
Touchy. Maybe some Dunmer lives in you yet.
Either pour another drink or keep moving, Ambarys.
What's new with the Cruel-Seas, Suvaris? Have they given you one of those helmets with the horns on them yet?
What do you want from me? I work for them ok? We're not friends. They pay me, and I get the job done. That's it.
Uh, yes sir. That's me. The oafish servant.
Skald, if you don't mind sir, I have a request.
You, have a request of me, Bulfrek? This should be interesting.
Well, I was thinking sir, with the war going on and all. Maybe, I could enlist? Fight the Imperials?
A servant? Enlisting in the Stormcloaks? Ah, Bulfrek, that's why I like having you about. You're always good for a laugh.
We even have a celebration planned for you.
Yours was not an easy transformation. But you're still alive, so congratulations.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Riften.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Morthal.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Dawnstar.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Markarth.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Solitude.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Whiterun.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Windhelm.
We've become aware of a problem in Winterhold.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Falkreath.
Well then, you won't be leaving here alive!
Well, err, yes. Sorry to have troubled you.
Do you think you might, err, have a moment to look at something for me?
Why, because I'm a Dunmer? We didn't all grow up in dwarven ruins, you know.
If this is another dwarven trinket, I keep telling you I'm not familiar with them.
Yes, I just thought perhaps you'd have, err, come across something like this before.
Well, on to the business at hand then, hmm?
Hmph. Pity. I had hoped to obtain even a modicum of justice.
Well? Get out of here and mind your rounds.
What about my father? Was he a good hunter?
Sometimes I'm surprised he's still the chief.
Oh, you've seen your father just trying to chase a skeever from his house. He's a bit soft.
We all are, my dear, but sometimes the Divines reward those who don't seem to deserve it. Call it dumb luck.
What? After all this, I can't even see him?
How... How do I know you're telling me the truth, and not just what I want to hear?
Will you be needing anything special today?
Well, he's been very busy. Perhaps today he'll have some free time.
Again? Are you sure? He still hasn't answered your last several requests.
Why don't you see if Arch-Mage Aren is interested in joining me for a meal?
Yeah, it's really something else, isn't it?
At this rate, the Guild won't be such a laughingstock anymore.
I agree. It'll be nice to get back the respect we lost in the last few years.
You know, things are really starting to move around here. I mean, look at the place. I've never seen so much merchandise.
Yes, madam. I know I have a lot to work on.
I'm sure it will be fine. Just don't be late.
Always! Perfection takes dedication, after all!
Yes, well, see that you keep at it. That is all.
I'll be the judge of that. Now, back to your practice.
Yes, Lady Ateia. My voice is strong as a Dragonborn's!
You there. Have you performed your voice exercises today?
Must it be written? Poetry is so dull when it isn't set to music.
At this point, I hardly see how your advice would improve it. It's flawless.
Yes sir, Professor Gemane! It's a war epic about Hoag Merkiller's last stand!
Oh, thank you! I've been working on an original piece. I hope it can stand up to the classics!
Pardon me, but I trust you've been working on your poem, on the classical heroes of Skyrim, yes?
Your solo performance is about a week away. I expect to hear your early rendition tomorrow, understand?
I've converted the classic tale of Eyldi the Bear to be performed with drums. I think you'll be impressed!
Why do we always focus on retelling the old stories? There are so many new stories being made, right now...
Patience, Illdi. We study the heroes of the past so we can have better understanding of the heroes of today... and tomorrow.
You're right, dear. I'm sorry to worry you.
Endon, dear, please don't.... Save your frustrations for work.
That's right! Papa helped me with the clasps, but I did all the links on my own.
We sold all those lovely little necklaces you brought me today. Did you make them yourself?
I miss those days, before the Forsworn took up arms again, when you could walk the roads in peace.
Adara bends the silver so naturally. Grandmother would have cried if she saw how deft our daughter has become.
Well, I'm proud of both of you. I haven't been so busy since those nobles from Solitude come into the city three years ago.
A little push and this would all be simpler.
You know how children are. Her fancies change with the moon.
And like always, the boy lacks any kind of spine. He'll need some convincing.
A... giant's toe? You're... sure about that?
Actually, yes Arch-Mage. I believe there is.
All I had hoped was to capture Mercer alive.
All right, then. Let's put that to the test.
Get there in one piece and we'll see if you've really got what it takes.
The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften... a tavern called the Ragged Flagon.
Alvor can help you out. He's our blacksmith.
If you need weapons or armor, see Alvor, the blacksmith.
Lucan's got a little bit of everything at the Riverwood Trader.
And by [QUOTE]supplies[QUOTE] I suppose you mean weapons and armor.
Always, child. Mara's mercy is ever-flowing.
Amaund Motierre? I have no idea who that is.
But Volunruud... that I have heard of. And I know where it is.
Are you prepared to receive my golden words?
Bah! You're just as bad as the rest of them.
Be careful. They're faster than you'd think.
Hello again, friend. I'll never forget what you did for me.
Step lightly. Who knows if those things can hear us or not.
I heard Valdr made it back safe. Too bad about the others, but at least it's one less thing to worry about.
Bless you, friend. You have renewed my hope.
You found it? I've been looking for that blade for months. You took on all those bandits yourself?
Thank you. Here, my father had a favorite sword and shield technique. Let me teach it to you, in honor of his memory.
Before I came into Zenithar's calling, I confess I was a thief. But I learned a few things in my time that might help you survive. Let me show you.
Clever try, scab, but it won't be that easy!
Come on, we just need a little elbow grease.
Well of course, not with an attitude like that!
I don't think we're going to get those potatoes to come in.
The ground is practically frozen. We can't dig down far enough.
Do you have some reason to be here, citizen?
Are my men now giving free reign to anyone who wanders into the castle?
There something I can do for you? Perhaps direct you to the nearest prison...
I remember you, you were at Helgen. Speak to Legate Rikke. I suspect we could use someone like you.
Don't worry, Arkay's protection is absolute.
Father, how old were you when you left home?
Yes, that's your mother's side of the family talking. Just stay on for one more season, that's all I ask.
But I don't want to be safe! I'm not afraid of the dangers out there. The only thing I'm afraid of is wasting my life on this farm.
I know where this is going, son. As I've said many a time. the world is a dangerous place. You're much safer here at the farm, with me.
Gods. A woman attacked right on the streets.
Are you all right? Did you see what happened?
Good, good. It'll be worth it, I assure you.
Ha! I didn't think he'd really give it back.
Thank you, friend. It's good to know I can count on you.
Has the Bloodmoon called you, fellow Hunter?
Here. Take this. For your time and all that.
Oh, thank you. The dogs were getting restless.
Thank you for this. Something for your trouble.
Oh dear. Darkwater Crossing needs medicines for its miners?
What's this? Oh, that's right, the timbers from Anga's Mill.
I'll look over this later. Why don't you take this, for your trouble?
Ah, Berit's ashes. He was a good man. Not many warriors grow to a fine, old age.
I'll see about getting this order filled right away. Here, a few septims for you.
Thank you for bringing this to me. I'll make sure he gets his rites. Here, for your trouble.
Ah yes, Adonato's new work. Shorter than I expected, but words must be judged on merit, not length.
Joric's sister? Poor child. Magic runs deep in that family's bloodline. It's not always a blessing.
I swear, that Aeri and her men would make fine Stormcloak recruits. Pity we can't spare the lumber to conscript them.
Here's the letter. Now leave me out of this.
Here's your payment. Well earned, as always.
Hmph. Well, that's sure to throw a branch into Falkreath's well-oiled political machine.
How about I trade you a song for some fruit?
You don't need my fruit, I've heard when you sing people throw tomatoes at you anyway.
How do you think the crops are coming, dear?
Terrible. Only a matter of time before soldiers come and burn all my hard work into dust!
I ain't going to lie, it's still pretty bad.
The pain's a little less than before, but it still hurts bad enough.
It's not as bad as before, but I still can't get a good night's sleep.
I am Sanguine, Daedric Prince of Debauchery!
I know, I know, how could I lie to you? Well, how could I trust you until we've shared a few drinks?
But it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff than this waste of flesh.
I don't expect you to know what that means.
Suffice to say that our Sybil was recently lost to us.
The ceremony you so rudely interrupted was the Exalted Protocol of the Dibellan Sybil.
If you can travel there, and retrieve our young Sybil, your transgression will be forgiven.
Through the Protocol, we have seen the home of the next Sybil, to the north, in a small village pressed against the stone.
I had another run-in with the Thieves Guild.
They represent the reason I'm here. I can't just ignore them, Aerin.
Be careful, Mjoll. The Thieves Guild has Maven Black-Briar at her back.
One snap of her fingers, and you could end up in Riften Jail... or worse.
I know. I just don't want you to leave; you're the only good thing that's happened to this city in a long time.
I have things I should see to, but go ahead.
I think you'd be a little smarter than that.
All right, calm down, no need to for that. I'll let you in right away, just need to get the gate unlocked.
I will have his head for this, I assure you.
Help take this down, will you? We're throwing everything we can at it.
Ancano. He's in there, doing... something. We don't know what. We're trying to get in now.
I wouldn't take that to heart. It's her way.
I assure you, had she been displeased with you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Think of her as a scolding mother continually pushing you harder to be successful; outwardly sounding angry but silently content.
I... I submit. What is your bidding, master.
I'd like to know as much as we can about it.
Well, perhaps it's time for some independent study.
Check with Urag gro-Shub in the Arcanaeum. See if he's aware of any references to this... thing that you and Tolfdir found.
I'd like to, but it's not as simple as that.
Old habits don't die easily, and we Nords can be as stubborn as stone.
Most of the folk in the city believe as Ulfric did, that outsiders should not be trusted.
Until those people learn to accept the Argonians, they must remain outside, for their own safety.
I'm hoping this wife can outlast the winter.
Mul is the smart one. I go where he tells me.
I am proud to have a mate to share in my blessings.
The great stronghold of Narzulbur welcomes you, outsider.
Mining is tough, but Mul says the money is good so we mine.
Been married many times, but the gods keep taking them from me.
Uglarz is a great huntress. Perhaps she can teach me something new.
Haven't you seen how my aunts act with my father? It's beyond strange.
Come to purchase ebony? Our Gloombound Mine runs thick with black veins.
The blessings of the mine have been many, but I have no mate to share them.
Sometimes I wonder if my aunts are right about my father -- he does seem weak.
Mauhulakh was such a darling boy. Until he got older and started having opinions.
Well at least now Mauhulakh has nothing to whine about. Until this one dies, too.
When we go back to Largashbur we'll be kings. I like Narzulbur, but don't tell Mul.
One of these days we need to head back to the Rift. Get some of that good Riften mead.
All my auguring never predicted this. A woman for Mauhulakh, eh? We'll see how this goes.
Yatul and I tend to dote on Mauhulakh. You know how aunts can be with their favorite nephew.
Glad my father seems to have found someone. I just hope she can hold her own against my aunts.
Yatul's been teaching me to hunt. I'm still learning, but she's the best teacher I could have.
I've read the entrails many times, but can't fathom why Mauhulakh's wives keep finding tragedy.
Orc chiefs should be strong and stand alone. They need no companions. Progeny is a poor excuse.
My brother keeps trying to spin these fantasies to me about my aunts and our father. He's crazy.
New to Narzulbur? If you're smart, you'll keep moving. There is a wicked shadow over this place.
I think I like this new mate of my father's. I mean... nothing like that. I just think she's nice.
I know I sound abrasive. It's just that I love Mauhulakh so much that I want us to be happy together.
I never knew my mother, but I doubt even she acted as affectionate with my father as Yatul and Bolar do.
Gadba and me came to work the mine. The plan is to get rich and then go back to Largashbur and take over!
Mauhulakh brought us in when he found ebony in the mine. Not enough men in town to work it, so here we are.
I never would have thought, but Uglarz is an even better hunter than Yatul was. The things I'm learning now...
Mauhulakh. He wants to be a leader but spends too much time moping over women. Bolar and I should be all he needs.
My sister is blind. I've told her she shouldn't spend so much time with Yatul, but she won't listen. Thinks she's nice.
Urog and Dushnamub were such lovely children. I held them as they watched their mothers die after birth. They know me best, now.
I'm sorry, I've come too far to lose it now.
If you can stop them, you'll be a true hero!
They're at Mistwatch. Here, let me show you on your map....
If you insist. Come on boys. This'll be fun.
Looks like we've got ourselves another fool.
Make it up? That doesn't seem appropriate...
I suppose I could copy his style based on what you brought me but I have no idea what happened in between these verses.
My husband and I were just recently married.
I like the farm life. It's a huge change from living in a city.
Pretty quiet out here on the farm. My wife and I kind of like the solitude.
Addvild's made me a happy woman. I wouldn't want to be with anyone else in the world.
The Snow-Shod's are very trusting to let me run this place without their supervision.
I'm originally from Cyrodiil, but I left there after I had a falling out with my family.
I'm glad there are guards outside the farm. I don't think I could defend the place alone.
If you're looking to purchase goods, I have none to sell. You should head into Riften instead.
Did you see the fires from Goldenglow Estate? I was afraid the whole place was going to burn to the ground!
Vulwulf has been quite generous to let me take care of their farm considering I am not part of their family.
This was the first door in Skyrim I knocked upon, and little did I know my future husband would be answering the door.
No, and I never will. Now get out of my inn!
So I need someone to find that proof for me.
My brother, Thorald. He was fighting for the Stormcloaks, and went missing. Everyone assumes he's dead.
But he's not. I just know it. The Imperials captured him, and they're holding him someplace. The Battle-Borns know where.
I'd go and search their house for proof, but they want me too. I'd be captured, and then we'll never know what happened to him.
So I'll ask again, Gray-Mane or Battle-Born?
New in town, huh? Whiterun's got two clans, both old and both respected.
Difference is, the Gray-Manes turned their backs on the Empire and we Battle-Borns stayed loyal.
So you have, mortal. Go now. Kill Orchendor.
So, the ending of my tale I began earlier...
Well, if you don't want to hear it, that's your loss.
If I wanted to hear a tall tale, I'll read a children's storybook. Get some better stories, Vipir.
Is this your tale of single-handedly fighting off a pack of trolls or my favorite... where you bedded four women on the same night?
So, what do we have here? Hmm. Let me guess.
By your scent, I'd say you were from the Guild. But that can't be true, because I told Mercer I wouldn't deal with them anymore.
Sorry, a girl can't be too careful out here.
Like I said, name's Angi and I've been living out here for a couple of years now.
Speak with Miss Salma, if you wish to speak.
I admit, there is strength in numbers. Perhaps between us...
I grow tired of debating this. If Miss Salma insists on this folly, so be it.
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
Tolfdir normally looks after your little group, yes?
Speak with Urag in the Arcanaeum. See if he is aware of anything that matches your discovery.
And... good work. The next time you find yourself exploring Nordic ruins, perhaps this will be helpful.
Since he's apparently occupied, and I will need to see this discovery for myself, I think perhaps you should begin researching the subject.
Thank you! You'll find the ruins right here.
That is the Necromancer's Amulet, of legend.
It appears you were at least half-right. There is necromancy at the heart of this.
I know it well. Or at least, I've heard of it. I would wager that carving once depicted a skull.
That's why I'm here with my Shield-Brothers.
Certainly not. But a true warrior would have relished the opportunity to take on a giant.
The College survived, and so here we remain.
The Sea of Ghosts practically came alive. No one was expecting it. Monstrous waves battered the shore for weeks on end.
The waves receded in time, but the damage was irreversible. Most residents of Winterhold abandoned what was left of the city.
Winterhold was ancient and weathered, but it couldn't withstand the sea's fury. Entire districts of the city were lost overnight.
Then I guess that's your last request, fool!
There you are. I've been trying to find you.
I just wanted to let you know that Ancano's been asking about you. I think he's looking for you.
There's nothing left of Winterhold. Nothing!
The guards don't even dare go up there unless they've no choice.
Look around you. Winterhold is in this state because of those damned mages.
They sit up there in their tower, doing gods-know-what, and who watches over them?
I do, and if you count yourself among their numbers then you've blood on your hands as well.
Everyone knows it's the College's fault that the sea swallowed our city. Still they deny it, but we all know the truth.
There's one way to find out. Try to Shout...
Yes. I think I am. You can Shout now. That can only mean one thing. You must be Dragonborn.
According to the old legends, only the Dragonborn can Shout without training, the way the dragons do.
Think we should buy more horses next season?
I'd rather spend the gold on a new litter of pups, but the horses bring in more gold.
This is not the time to keep Astrid waiting.
This is part of me. Guard it with your life.
I do. I've been working on mine for a while now.
I've got it right here. Just don't read it, it's not very good.
Here you are. Always good to see a fellow bard. Tell Giraud I said hello.
I suppose Giraud sent you for it? I was still trying to get the wording right but here it is.
Umm.... No, my Jarl. I'm afraid there isn't.
The Forsworn ambush our roads and dragons cloud the skies. Is there any good news?
More settlements have sent riders to say dragons are being spotted throughout Skyrim.
Vald? Why would you want to help that idiot?
He owes me a steep debt. In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work for Mercer.
Vilkas will see if you're worth our trouble.
Keep up the effort, boy. Eyes on the horizon, always.
Keep up the effort, young one. Eyes on the horizon, always.
I hear you have spirit. This is good. You may yet join our numbers.
Wait. There's something different about you.
Ah, my disciples have sent me a fresh soul. Good. I was getting... hungry.
We have plenty of ingredients for sale, too.
A little Wheat and Blisterwort makes a healing potion, if you didn't know.
Long as you clean up. You know how to use it right? Mix a couple of ingredients together, see what happens.
Welcome to the Legion, auxiliary. Listen up.
Welcome to Whiterun, friend. Go right on in.
Well if it turns up, I'll be willing to buy.
Well, if some Moon Sugar should fall into your lap...
Puttin' together another shipment from Morrowind, Vekel. Lookin' for anythin' special?
Maybe. That stuff's gettin' tough to bring across the border with all the Argonian patrols.
Well that's not how I operate, so forget it.
Oh, very well. Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done.
Well, then you won't be leaving here at all.
Are you attempting to threaten me? After I've been so hospitable?
Fine. Take them and be gone. Never return here, or else you'll face my full wrath.
What do you know about my people, outlander?
You're right. Malacath teaches us to meet our fate. Perhaps this is mine.
What? Who are you? How did you get this far?
What's that? Oh yes, yes. Thank you, I will.
Ah. Well, then. Let me know if you need anything.
Are you looking for any specific volumes, Drevis?
Hmm? Oh, no. No, not really. I... Actually, I've forgotten what I was looking for.
You aren't making any sense. Hand what over?
Look, you must have me confused with someone else.
Hand what over? I have no idea what you're talking about.
You did? Maybe that's why I'm so sleepy now.
You do indeed have the power. I'm impressed.
Please, follow me. I'll escort you inside the College.
You're back. Good. You'll want to hear this.
Maro is dead, I know. But we've got bigger problems right now!
You're just in time to say hello to Roggvir.
Wish I could head inside Solitude myself. Wouldn't mind seeing Roggvir get what's coming to him.
You're not listening to me. I don't have it.
Okay? The deal was already done, the thing just never showed up. I can't help that!
I set up the whole deal. A courier was supposed to be bringing it from Morrowind. He never arrived.
...retire some day... get myself an island...
...never enough gold... just need one good haul...
...need me some skooma... the imported stuff... just one last time...
...might pay off my bounty this time... walk into the city a free man...
...gonna start keepin' a knife in my boot... tired of gettin' disarmed...
...once was a woman, as fair as an evenin', of springtime in old Stros M'Kai...
...should have known she was lying... said she'd wait for me... but they never wait...
...I'll never do another span in that stinking jail... rather die than give myself up...
...he he he... two threes? What was he thinking? Fool never saw me pull that ace out of my boot...
..told him to just hand over the gold, but did he listen? Oh, no... they always have to fight back...
...lyin' little harlot... that brat ain't mine... could be anyone's... won't get one rusty septim from me...
...mead, mead, mead... ...kill 'em to get some beer every now and then? ...stupid bees and their stupid honey...
...kill him, he talks to me like that again... ...get him while he's sleeping... ...or poison his meat... ...see how he likes that...
...picking pockets, now that's the real art... ...no rough stuff, just take it and go... ...hmph, don't sound like much fun, though...
...with three beers down, the Orc did frown, and bid the Elf goodbye... ...for none could know, 'twas not for show, and someone had to die...
...[QUOTE]go to the college[QUOTE] da said... [QUOTE]use your smarts[QUOTE] he said... like I'm supposed to figure out which college he meant...
...hmph, wizards... Now that's power... Bet they got that [QUOTE]secret[QUOTE] magic... can turn wood to gold... yeah... Wish I could turn wood to gold...
Afraid I'll cause another scene, I suppose...
If there's anything I can ever do for you, do not hesitate to call upon me!
Ah, the one generous soul amongst a gathering of pinch-pennies and lick-spittles!
My friend, you are very perceptive! I have a powerful thirst that cannot be slaked!
Ah, the nectar of the gods! If there's ever anything I can do for you, just name it!
Of course! I would do anything for you, my one and truest friend! What do you need from me?
Indeed. Being a drunken boor is thirsty work. And I can't seem to find my way back to the bar...
And none of the waiters will bring me a drink. Elenwen must have told them to cut me off, the frigid bitch.
Ah, yes. There was an incident, wasn't there?
Another incident? I must say, I'm disappointed.
As I've said, a donation of 250 should help take care of that.
I also hope that this is the last time we'll need to discuss this.
Then, as I've said, 1000 gold will be required to set things right.
It's most unfortunate that we need to have this discussion once again.
I thought I made it clear that this sort of behavior is totally unacceptable.
I made it rather clear that a donation of 500 gold will clear it up rather neatly.
Strictly to cover damages, you understand. I believe 250 gold should be sufficient.
I think a donation of 500 gold on your part is necessary in order to put this behind us.
As an act of good faith on your part, I'd advise that you consider donating an amount of gold to the College.
It cannot become widely known that these sorts of things happen here. Work will need to be done to keep this quiet.
These matters are becoming more difficult to deal with. I'm going to need 1000 gold from you in order to make reparations.
Well, as this is the first time this has happened, I'll make it very clear that the College does not condone that sort of behavior.
Always a pleasure to meet a prospective bard.
You should be aware that many apply but we accept very few people.
When possible, we ask applicants to perform tasks the college needs completed. In this case, I do have a task befitting an aspiring bard...
And Torygg wasn't ready to let it fall apart.
Because the food and resources we get from the Empire are important to our people.
Because even if we can't openly worship him, Talos the god was once Tiber Septim the man, and this is his Empire.
Because the Dominion is a sleeping beast that Skyrim cannot slay alone. Because many Nords are part of the Imperial army even now.
Be about your business, while I'm about mine.
It is not eyes that reveal another's true nature. It is the heart.
Now here is a face I did not expect to see. Be mindful, for you walk among adders.
There are words spoken, and words unspoken. Beware these Thalmor, for they are adept in both languages.
If your eyes and your ears are open and your mind is free of judgement and expectation, you might learn much in this chamber.
Come up to the Skyforge to pay your respects.
The others have probably prepared Kodlak's funeral by now.
Curse you for bringing up that bitter memory.
I can tell you're new around here, askin' a question like that.
Now he's dead and gone and the Skyforge of Jorrvaskr lies cold.
Well, that and maybe those stuck-up, dung-sniffing Battle-Borns.
You should ask him about his work. It's the only subject that'll get him talking.
Not long ago it was my husband Eorlund. There was no finer smith in the nine holds.
My husband Eorlund tends the Skyforge up at Jorrvaskr, the Companions mead hall. There's no finer smith in the nine holds.
Do you have the fragments of Wuuthrad, still?
I'll need to prepare them for mounting again.
Do you not know the Daedric Lord of the Hunt?
A powerful force, not to be crossed. As I learned too late.
He revels in the chase, and also gave the [QUOTE]gift[QUOTE] of lycanthropy to mortals.
Do your loyalties lie with the Thalmor, then?
I warn you, Gray-Mane, you are treading on dangerous ground.
A law made at the tip of an Aldmeri sword, aye. A sword stained red with Nord blood.
Don't threaten me, boy. You're either a Nord who respects our traditions, or you're not.
If not, it isn't me you'll have to answer to, but the people of this city and this hold.
Is this what our people fought and died for? To forsake our most beloved ancestor and divine?
I won't say it again, Vignar - Talos worship is forbidden. It's the Empire's law, and we're still a part of the Empire.
I'm no happier about this than you are, but I don't want the see the Thalmor rounding up people in the streets and throwing them in prison.
Don't think I'm being paid already? Get lost.
That I will, stranger. This is more than the Silver-Bloods are paying us. We'll clear out.
Exactly, Bulfrek. You always know your place.
Yes, my Jarl. We could hardly waste anyone else's precious time on such a tedious task.
Bulfrek, I have an order of swords and armor from the local blacksmith coming here. I need every piece polished to a fine shine.
He just wants you to follow in his footsteps.
I understand. It just isn't me. I'm not a warrior and I don't think I ever will be.
Then by Talos, you do what you feel you're meant to do. I'll take care of your father for you.
Mother, what can I do to make father happier? It seems no matter how successful I become he doesn't care.
Of course he cares. You just have to understand that your father was a soldier and he'll always be a soldier.
He's as pig-headed a man as you'll ever find.
I wasn't sure that he'd see the light, but I'm sure you [QUOTE]explained[QUOTE] it to him. Well done!
The key is that ugly dwarven urn in his shop. Smash that thing to bits and he'll change his attitude.
How quickly you've advanced. Most impressive.
But there are risks. There are always risks. You must summon and command an unbound Dremora.
There are spells yet to be learned, powerful spells that can more closely and more permanently bind creatures to your will.
Huh. Not sure. I don't worship Talos, myself.
I think I heard someone mention it was underneath the Temple of Dibella, in the big crag in the center of the city.
I could do this all day. Here's your payment.
Of course she is. I hear the mining business is extremely cutthroat. And those hours... they're murder.
I daresay you've learned all I can teach you.
But... That doesn't mean there isn't more out there.
I do not know - but none have passed through.
Alduin, his hunger insatiable, hunts the lost souls snared within this shadowed valley.
Can you lead the way to where Shor's hall waits, beckoning us on to welcome long sought?
I don't like you... I think you're a heretic.
I have spent my entire life searching for it.
... for in my current condition, I'll never be able to lay my hands on it.
I even named my shop after it, hoping that it might attract anyone who had heard of it.
It brought me all the way to these frozen reaches from the warm embrace of Summerset Isle.
And now it's within my grasp... but the Eight, it seems, have chosen me for their amusement.
Entire years spent in libraries. Seeking out tiny villages with local legends that contain but a whisper of a hint of the Phial.
I hope you brought a little something for me.
First, let's count the coin, then we can get back to business.
And here I expected you to hop the next caravan to Morrowind. What have you got for me?
I promise to join you there as soon as I can.
I'm afraid not. There are preparations to make and Gallus's remains to lay to rest.
I think I've said enough. Now leave me alone.
Be careful, Niluva is a bit... aggressive when she's cornered.
I wonder if perhaps you could assist with it.
It may not be [QUOTE]official[QUOTE], but there is a, uhh, project I've been working on.
But... I can't help but notice that you're doing quite well for yourself, rising through the ranks and all.
I'll also notify my guards of your new title.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Eastmarch. Congratulations.
I'll be at the docks if you change your mind.
I'll... I'll go speak to Fastred. Post-haste!
She would? If she's willing to deal with him, then everything would be all right.
I'm afraid not. I don't deal in stolen goods.
Stolen? How can you be certain? I may have just misplaced it somewhere in the city.
It's made of gold with an inscription on the inside that says [QUOTE]sand elske.[QUOTE]
I was hoping you could help me. It seems I've lost a ring that also means quite a bit to me.
Lady Mjoll, if you lost a gold ring anywhere in this city I'm afraid it's likely never to be seen again. I'm sorry.
I've a mine to run, so if you'll excuse me...
If you go in there, you don't come out. Ever.
Last I'd heard, he'd been carted off to Northwatch Keep. Ever heard of it?
Here, see for yourself. This is the last word I received. I'm telling you, he's gone for good.
In any event, nice work. Here's your payment.
Personally, I've always found Argonians to be incredibly unpredictable opponents. Especially near water.
Is everything well with you, my scaly friend?
Yes, well... That's all we ask of you. Carry on.
Teeba-Ei is cold, but Teeba-Ei works hard as always.
It worked! I knew you'd come, I just knew it!
I did the Black Sacrament, over and over. With the body, and the... the things. And then you came! An assassin from the Dark Brotherhood!
It's fine... I had to tell someone I suppose.
Carrying around a weight like that... it hurts after a while. Cuts you inside like a dagger to the heart.
It's for Marise, but don't say a word to her!
Don't worry, Shadr, your secret is safe with me.
Here's another septim, Madesi. How much more do I need?
Only thirty more and it'll be all yours. If I might ask, who is the lucky woman?
Know about them? Lad, you're looking at them.
Know about them? Lass, you're looking at them.
Heard of them? I've been captaining a crew for 'em well on nine years now. What's it to you?
Laborers. The sick. The lame. We're all here.
It's where you go if you can't afford a room anywhere else. About the time they opened the mines, someone got the idea to throw beds in here.
Most people head over to the Winking Skeever.
If you're not interested in music or drink, you can at least talk to Corpulus. He can fill you in on any of the latest gossip.
My men? What did you do? You'll die for this.
Next season, nephew. Next season for sure....
Could I maybe, skip the excavation, Uncle Calcelmo? I, uh, I just think you won't need me.
[QUOTE]Next season for sure...[QUOTE] What? Uncle Calcelmo, I don't understand what you mean.
The excavation, Aicantar! Right after I finish my book. We'll start excavating Nchuand-Zel again.
Nonsense, you're a vital part of my research team. You'll be there, have no fear! Now, I don't want to hear another word of protest.
Of course you were. Now stop wasting my time.
Oh, fine. Keep your secrets. I see how it is.
That wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now, just up the road.
One of the prisoners, if I recall correctly.
Really? I mean... I still feel like I'm here.
Remember. I need that bandit dead. Not alive.
Show those marauders what Windhelm justice tastes like.
Bandits are cowards. Don't strain yourself chasing them all down.
I used to be an adventurer in my day, then I settled down. Got married.
You wouldn't be a sellsword, would you? I have a little problem you could solve.
Seven. Astonishing. I hadn't considered that.
I mean, it would take months... years to work out the differentials. But what a revolutionary concept.
Wait, wait. I can see a minor problem in your theory. Without a soul siphon, how would you prevent permanent magicka burn?
Sometimes I think your head is made of rocks.
Oh, good point. I wish my head were made of rocks.
That would be good! I could use it to smash other rocks. Easier to mine, then.
The Eldergleam has blessed us with a sapling.
There are dragons about, traveler. Be warned.
It happened so fast. One minute the dragon was there, the next it was gone. Everything was destroyed.
This Dwemer lockbox. Look upon it and wonder.
Ooooh, an observant one. How clever to ask of Septimus.
The scroll will give the deep vision needed to open it.
Inside is the heart. The heart of a god! The heart of you. And me.
But it was hidden away. Not by the Dwarves, you see. They were already gone.
For not even the strongest machinations of the Dwemer can hold off the all-sight given by an Elder Scroll.
Someone else. Unseen. Unknown. Found the heart, and with a flair for the ironical, used Dwarven trickery to lock it away.
This has nothing to do with you, so back off.
Traditionally it's carried by the court mage.
For a piece like that, I could pay... 500 gold?
The Wheelstone? Have you decided to sell it, yet?
I would... eh... be interested in acquiring it. If you're willing to part with it, that is.
Let me see... ah, yes. This is the Wheelstone. It's an heirloom symbol of the power of Windhelm.
Unfortunate. Let's be more careful next time.
So I hear. You've brought honor to the Companions and yourself.
We are all blood here. One family, one tribe.
I am... surprised that Gularzob was named chief.
The days of staying within Largashbur's walls are over.
Only a true Orc knows how to temper Orichalcum properly.
Malacath demands much of us now. We will not fail him again.
It is good to finally know that Malacath has not forsaken us.
I will serve Gularzob as best I can, even though I am his elder.
Lob will one day take my place, and bring honor to our tribe as I have.
I learn much from Garakh every day. I must learn if I am to take her place.
I've worked with metal long enough that I almost never burn myself anymore.
I will do my best to lead the tribe, but I don't know why Malacath chose me.
Every blade I make honors Malacath. Every rivet, every plate of armor is for him.
Atub is wise beyond her years. I take her advice seriously, and you should as well.
Yamarz betrayed us all. I will never allow that to happen again, so long as I rule.
Gularzob has been chosen as chief. He will one day be great, but he has much to learn.
The ways of the mystic are known to me. I have remedies and cures, should you need them.
Largashbur will not soon forget what you have done. We have a second chance thanks to you.
My weapons will someday be as strong as my mother's, and Malacath will be pleased with me.
We have learned from our mistakes. Malacath's needs come first, and we will serve him faithfully.
Do not raise arms against my people, and you shall always have a place here, Champion of Malacath.
I am honored to have been chosen to lead. But I know that being picked by Malacath does not mean that I am ready.
The old traditions are passed down from one generation to the next. The secrets of smithing are passed down as well.
Well don't just stand there. Go get my flute!
Larina. That fool student of mine stole my flute and sold it to some necromancer.
I just got a ransom note for it. That flute has been handed down for seventeen generations!
Well, that's taken care of. No thanks to you.
You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Sister.
You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Brother.
Well... No. Not really. Not directly, I mean.
I'm quite aware of what's going on here, and I will not stand for it!
But I know things are said behind my back. Conversations cease when I enter rooms.
What a delightful find! This should cover it.
What do you see from that little cage? Speak.
Fool! Did you think Molag Bal, the Lord of Domination, would so easily reward you?
Where are my goods? Did the shipment come in?
Only a few things came today. Cedran said he'd drop it off later.
Cedran said he'd... what am I paying you for? Next time, you bring the shipment in yourself.
Why, this is astounding news! Wonderful news!
You mean, after all that's transpired, the Dark Brotherhood will still... honor the contract?
If you can get onboard that ship. Kill Titus Mede II, as contracted... I will reveal the location of the dead drop that holds your payment.
The Emperor is still in Skyrim, but not for long. He's onboard his ship, the Katariah, moored offshore in the Solitude Inlet. But you must hurry!
Yes, I'm afraid you're right. Such a shame...
Sorry Mercer, they no longer wish to be involved in our operation.
Brynjolf, have you had a chance to speak to our contact in Whiterun?
I have. I think we may have to turn this one over to the Dark Brotherhood.
I trust you've applied the appropriate pressure in order to change their mind?
Yet another child has prayed to their mother.
You must speak with the Farmhand at Chillfurrow farm.
Speak with the Blasphemous Priest at the Temple of Kynareth, in Whiterun. Accept his gold, then kill the target. Hail Sithis!
Speak with the Corrupt Agent at the Penitus Oculatus Outpost, in Dragon Bridge. Accept his gold, then kill the target. Hail Sithis!
Speak with the Scheming Servant at the Keep in Markarth. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Indolent Farmer at the Vilemyr Inn, in Ivarstead. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Nervous Patron at Candlehearth Hall, in Windhelm. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Desperate Gambler at the Barracks, in Windhelm. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Wary Outlaw at the Bee and Barb, in Riften. Accept his gold, and then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Dishonored Skald at the Bards College, in Solitude. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Unemployed Laborer at the Frostfruit Inn, in Rorikstead. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Griefstricken Chef, at the Windpeak Inn, here in Dawnstar. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. Hail the Listener! Hail Sithis!
You can't scare me into submission. Let's go.
You dare bring me here? You must be punished.
You did? We heard that Ulfric was captured...
... no, sorry, but in times like these I can't just take the word of a stranger who wanders into town claiming to be my brother's friend.
You might be able to trap him there, exactly.
You must trust in the rightness of your cause, and the strength of your Voice.
You'd require the Jarl's cooperation, of course. That might not be easy to come by.
Ain't nothing for it. They're still in charge.
First war, and now dragons. Everywhere they go, the Nords bring nothing but ruin.
