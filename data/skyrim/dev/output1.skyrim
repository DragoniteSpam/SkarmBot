That [QUOTE]boy[QUOTE] was High King of Skyrim.
My scouts tell me they're loading them with fire.
You Imperials are efficient, I'll give you that.
No. Of course not. Just - don't let me down Cipius.
Proventus. Bring me my pen. And the good parchment.
Oblivion take them. Every miserable last one of them.
The outer walls are strong. If we can hold them there...
Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!
Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?
We'll need to set up water brigades to combat the flames.
This is it! Time to see what these Stormcloaks are made of.
They want this as much as you do. Perhaps they want it more.
As in all things, Lord, caution... I urge us to wait and see.
The Jarls weren't asked. We were told. And we had to like it.
If Ulfric wants to challenge my rule in the old way, let him.
Sir, they're on the move. They'll be at the gates at any moment!
No. But neither is every man able to give that order when he must.
He'll do no such thing! A dagger in the back is all you could expect!
My men are fearless. It's the Imperial milk drinkers I'm worried about.
Is any man ever ready to give the order that will mean the deaths of many.
Aye, and the sons of Skyrim will greet that dawn teeth and swords flashing.
I need to make a few things clear before I accept these Legionnaires of his.
Proventus, what do you make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack Whiterun...
I have a message for you to deliver to our friend, the esteemed Jarl of Windhelm.
And what harm is there in letting a few legionnaires die in place of your own men?
Send the word. [QUOTE]A new day is dawning and the sun rises over Whiterun.[QUOTE]
True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove his army's.
But you are that man, Ulfric.  You've been that man before, and you'll be him again.
Though I suspect he'll prefer to send his [QUOTE]Stormcloaks[QUOTE] to do it for him.
Damnit. Where'd they get catapults? The city walls are already falling apart as it is.
They're the meanest, toughest sons of bitches Skyrim has to offer. And they want this.
And these men and women - they call themselves Stormcloaks because they believe in you...
This again?! That was different. Was I given a chance to object to the terms of the treaty? No.
Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius's request? I mean, if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric...
But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric has made it clear. In his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with the Empire.
I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or to declare his intentions.
And I might be old myself, but I'll kick those damn walls down with my bare feet! - if you would only ask me to do it!
Whiterun's army will no doubt be bolstered with Legionnares. And those walls around Whiterun are old, but they still stand.
I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or march his Stormcloaks up to the gates.
This again?! That was different. Was Balgruuf given a chance to object? No. The Jarls weren't asked. He was told. And he had to like it.
Sir?
General.
Jarl Hrongar...
Jarl Balgruuf...
You people and your damn Jarls.
It's not a cause. It's a rebellion.
We'll let it seem like it's his idea.
You Nords and your bloody sense of honor.
He'd be insane to try. He doesn't have the men.
I'm telling you, Ulfric's planning an attack on Whiterun.
You can't force a Nord to accept help he hasn't asked for.
On the plus side, he also refuses to acknowledge Ulfric's claim.
On the other hand, he also refuses to acknowledge Ulfric's claim.
Balgruuf refuses the Legion's right to garrison troops in his city.
Call it whatever you like, General. The man's going to try to take Whiterun.
If Ulfric's making a move for Whiterun, then we need to be there to stop him.
Well, if he wants to stand outside the protection of the Empire, fine. Let Ulfric pillage his city.
That's not what my scouts report, sir. Every day more join his cause. Riften, Dawnstar, and Winterhold support him.
Hrongar carries on the policies of his brother and refuses to acknowledge the Legions right to garrison troops in his city.
Draft another letter with the usual platitudes, but this time share some of your intelligence regarding Ulfric's plans. Embellish if you have to.
Unh!
Naggh!
Waaagh!
Agh! Pathetic mortal!
Ha! You can never truly stop me!
Ugh! Only a fool tries to kill the dead!
Vex?
Agreed.
Delvin?
Karliah?
Absolutely.
Sure, why not.
Now everyone get back to work.
Look, I've never been good at these things, so I'm just going to keep it short.
With that in mind, I propose that the position of Guild Master should be yours.
Everyone is in agreement, so all I can do now is name you Guild Master and wish you good fortune and long life.
Being Guild Master means more than just getting a cut of all the loot, it's about being a leader and keeping this rabble in order.
Yay!
Because it's always true.
That's what you always say.
Can we at least go to the tavern for supper?
Can you close up the stand early today, mama?
Tsk. And to think, I was going to feed you cabbages and apples again. Yes, little fairy, we can go to the tavern for supper.
I'm afraid not, little fairy. The fruit has about another day left before it spoils. We've got to sell as much as we can, as soon as we can.
Yep.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes...
Correct.
It is so.
Leave me.
The mill!
Um. Yeah.
Yes dear.
It's true.
Thank you!
That is so.
Uh... yeah.
What the..?
Ahh... yeah.
By the gods!
Many thanks!
Many thanks.
The smelter!
True enough.
Umm... yeah.
Go away. Now.
Magic. Great.
Thanks a lot!
Um... yeah...
You're naked!
Oh, thank you!
Dress yourself.
The flour mill!
You're correct.
Ah, dangerous...
Azura bless you.
Gods be praised.
Not now, please.
Thank you, dear.
Thanks. I guess.
You are correct.
I can't talk now.
My thanks to you.
Fire is not a toy.
Go away... please?
That is the truth.
That is true, yes.
Let me stew. Alone.
What are you doing?
It speaks the truth.
Magic. Foul magic...
What in the world...
You speak the truth.
It speaks truthfully.
Just go away, please.
Here. This is for you.
Malacath preserve you.
Somebody do something!
Careful with that fire.
Gods' blessings on you.
Oh, no... No, no, no...
Go on, leave me alone...
Thank you, oh thank you.
This can't be happening.
Ysmir's blessing on you.
I'm too upset to talk....
Oh, now, do be careful...
Please... I... not now...
Wait, what are you doing?
What's all the commotion?
Aren't you... embarrassed?
How are we doing over here?
Naked. Naked, naked, naked!
Oh, I do not approve at all.
Take care with those flames.
I think it's time to leave...
Good job. Take this in return.
Here. I want you to have this.
I suppose thanks are in order.
Oh, now, that can't be good...
You want another one of those?
Not now. I'm too upset to talk.
Now is not the time for talk...
Thanks! Here - this is for you.
Better not set anything on fire.
It should put on some coverings.
Look... Now's not a good time...
Put on some damn clothes already!
We're here to teach you a lesson.
Yes, yes, thank you and all that.
Cover yourself. Have you no shame?
Gods help us, this can't end well.
It is planning on starting a fire?
Now our business together is done.
Anyway, it's done. Time to move on.
By Ysmir, this will not end well...
Please, I can't... Just... just go.
This is last time we speak of this.
Have a fascination with fire, do we?
Here. Take this. I hope you like it.
I want a drink, not company. Now go.
Is it getting hot, or is it just me?
Let's go our separate ways now, hmm?
Oh, this is not going to end well...
Fool! What do you think you're doing?
Good. Take this gift. We're even now.
Put on some clothes, you damned fool.
Whoa, now... ease off on the magic...
Ah, my thanks. Malacath watch over ya.
Don't set anything on fire, all right?
Good. Take this token of my gratitude.
I've seen enough. Put on some clothes.
Look... You shouldn't be doing that...
Take care not to set anything on fire.
Well now. I guess I owe you my thanks.
Good job. Please accept this in return.
Hey now, you be careful with that fire.
It should be careful with those flames.
Not now. I'm... much too upset to talk.
Now is not a good time. Leave me alone.
Now we can put this all behind us, hmm?
This one suggests donning some apparel.
Careful not to torch anything important.
Damned wizards and their damned magic...
Fire is not a thing to be played with...
I wish I could play with fire like that.
Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm upset?
Don't go setting the place on fire, okay?
Many thanks. Here - a token of gratitude.
Now we never talk about it again. Got it?
Well done. Here, a token of appreciation.
I don't know if that's such a good idea...
I found this. I thought you might like it.
Let's both get on with our lives now, hmm?
Now let's not talk about it anymore, okay?
You ought to cover your... unmentionables.
You've got that fire under control. Right?
Have the decency to leave me to my sorrows.
Oh goodness, someone's going to get killed.
Try not to set anything on fire, all right?
What in the name of the gods are you doing?
You are like my brood to me. Here. A token.
Fine. Please accept this token of gratitude.
Here. For you. Don't thank me, just take it.
It should be embarrassed to be uncovered so.
Not sure you should be walking around naked.
Now, let's just pretend this never happened.
What kind of fool plays with fire like that?
Get out of here.... I'm in no mood to talk...
Here. For you. For my hatchling of the heart.
I have something I want to give to you. Here.
Leave me alone... I'm in no mood for talking.
Umm. You got no clothes. You should get some.
Very well. Here, take this for your troubles.
You should be more careful with those flames.
Oh. Good job. Here... My way of saying thanks.
Thank you. Please, take this for your efforts.
This is going to end horribly, I just know it.
Dear, you really ought to be careful with fire.
I trust you'll keep your mouth shut about this.
I'm grateful for your efforts. Here, take this.
It's done. No more... no more talking about it.
Not now, please. I'm just... too upset to talk.
Now, let's pledge never to speak of this again.
Please... I... I can't talk to you right now...
You're not afraid you'll set fire to something?
Now, let us bury the memory of these dark deeds.
The deed is done. We need speak of it no longer.
You know... you ain't so bad. Here. Take this...
You really should put on some clothes, you know.
You're not supposed to play with fire, you know.
Ysmir's beard - I don't like the look of this...
Either I'm drunk, or you're naked. Possibly both.
Now let's, um, not talk about this anymore. Okay?
Now, let's pretend this never happened, shall we?
You shouldn't play around with magic like that...
You're going to get us all killed, you damn fool!
Ysmir's beard, you're going to freeze to death...
Crazy n'wah - you're trying to get someone killed?
Oh, someone's going to get hurt, I just know it...
You aren't as attractive as you'd like to believe.
But enough of this. Such things are best forgotten.
Plan on burning everything down, do you? Damn fool.
Begone. I have no wish to speak to anyone right now.
Just... get out of my face. I've got nothing to say.
Now... This conversation never happened. Understood?
Oh, great. I'm gonna get killed by a crazy wizard...
The world's gone mad with sorcerers now, is that it?
Careful, now. Wouldn't want someone to get... burned.
You might consider putting on... something. Anything.
All right, we've all seen enough. Put on some clothes.
I wanted to give you this. A token of my appreciation.
Much obliged. Here. It's not much, but take it anyway.
Thanks a lot! Here. Take this. For all your hard work.
What's the matter with you? You want to start a blaze?
You're a good friend. Here. Take this. You'll like it.
I'm glad we're friends. I have something for you. Here.
Now, let us put this behind us and speak of it no more.
Now, let us turn our thoughts to more pleasant matters.
Now we can both pretend this whole thing never happened.
Ought put on some clothes. Bound to upset some people...
Well. I do suppose thanks are in order. So... my thanks.
A true friend is a gift. Here. I'd like you to have this.
But let's not talk about it anymore. What's done is done.
Here. I'd like you to have this as a token my friendship.
I do hope you know what you're doing with those flames...
I'm in no mood for conversation. Now go, and leave me be.
I've been holding on to this for you. I hope you like it.
Now, as far as I'm concerned, none of this ever happened.
Thanks a lot. Here - a little something for your trouble.
Now I just want to put the whole nasty business behind me.
Wonderful! Here, take this. I hope it's fair compensation.
I'm surprised you succeeded. Please accept this as payment.
Someone stop this fool sorcerer before someone gets killed.
What are you, some kind of barbarian? Don't care for armor?
You're not planning on burning anything with that, are you?
Here's to friendship. A gift! If you don't like it, too bad.
I had to get this for you when I saw it. I hope you like it.
Mind your tricks, wizard. No need for someone to get hurt...
Mind yourself with that fire. Don't burn anything down, now.
So I found something. Here. Take it. I think you'll like it.
Excellent. And now, please accept this token of appreciation.
Here, take this small token of appreciation for your efforts.
I trust we'll never need to speak of this again... to anyone.
It's probably not a good idea to walk around naked like that.
Really? Good show. Here, take this. You know, as a thank you.
There's plenty more where that came from. Just give a holler.
Well done, indeed. Please accept this as a sign of my thanks.
I've been holding onto this for you. Here! I hope you like it.
This'll teach you not to take things that don't belong to you!
Whoa. Hope you know what you're doing with those flames there.
Now let us turn our conversation away from such unpleasantness.
Now, so we're clear - this is the last time we talk about this.
Here. It isn't much, but... I hope it's the thought that counts.
You always brighten my day a little. Here. I hope you like this.
Careful with those flames, unless you plan on torching something.
My joy knows no bounds. Here. A little payment for your troubles.
Enough already. Put on some clothes. You're making people nervous.
Finely done. Here, please accept this gift as a sign of my thanks.
Next time, you might want to get dressed before leaving the house.
Now... I don't really want to talk about it anymore. So let's not.
Now... I trust we'll never have to speak of this again. To anyone.
I'm so glad you succeeded. Here. Please take this for your trouble.
Those flames get out of control, and you're gonna wish they hadn't.
Ah, good, good. Now please, take this. Just my way of saying thanks.
Gonna get cold tonight. Might want to at least cover your delicates.
I hope you'll agree that these dark deeds are best left forgotten...
Um... I was thinking you might like this. Here. It's nothing really.
What happened is between you, me, and Azura. Let's keep it that way.
I couldn't be more pleased. Take this small token of my appreciation.
I'm truly grateful. Please accept this as a token of my appreciation.
What do you think you're doing? Knock it off with the flames already.
Please. Remove your naked obscenity from the company of civilized folk.
Careful. They might put you away if you don't at least put on some pants.
It has done a good thing. It will take this gift as a token of gratitude.
Now the whole thing's over and done with. So let's stop talking about it.
Even rags would be preferable to your current wardrobe. Or lack thereof...
This one is honored by your friendship. I hope this gift does honor to you.
Dear. You really ought to put some clothes on. You're embarrassing yourself.
The way you walk around at home is your own business. When you're at home...
Hmph. Hadn't expected you had it in you. Here. Take this for a job well done.
Now let's just, you know, try to forget any of this ever happened. All right?
Thank you. Honor dictates something in return. I hope you find this pleasing.
This one wonders - do you have no clothes, or just like the feel of the wind?
Umm... So, the business is done. This is the last we'll talk about it, right?
Put on a cloth sack at the very least. You're making me... unseasonably warm...
So we're not going to talk about this any more, right? Because I don't want to.
I'm just glad to put all this behind me. So let's never speak of it again, okay?
You're always a sight for sore eyes. Here, I've been hanging on to this for you.
In dark times friends bring light. This is for you. Thank you for your friendship.
Very good. But you've created a debt between us. Here. Take this. We are even now.
When I found this, I immediately thought of you. Here. A small token of my gratitude.
Many thanks. And please, take this gift. I hope it's a fitting token to honor the deed.
I saw this and thought of you. It would be a waste on anyone lesser. I hope you like it.
I wanted you to have this. A token of my affection. Don't mean we're engaged or nothin'.
Your deed was true, and so is my gratitude. Please take this in return for your efforts.
You must either be crazy or supremely confident to go walking around with no clothes on...
In a world of fools, you stand out above the rest. Here, take this small sign of my friendship.
Really. We aren't interested in seeing all that. Remove yourself until you are properly attired!
I wasn't sure it'd ever happen. Here. I want you to have this. My way of saying [QUOTE]thanks.[QUOTE]
Umm... don't suppose you'd want to take that fire somewhere else? You know... somewhere away from me?
You bring a smile to this one's eyes and peace to his heart. Take this. A small token of appreciation.
I can't thank you enough. Here, take this. It's not much, but please accept it as a token of my thanks.
It's really great we're friends. I was hoping to find some way to thank you. I hope this does the trick.
I do hope you know what your doing with those flames. It would be quite a shame if something caught fire.
Excellent! Thank you... Here, take this as, um, a sign of my gratitude. It's not much, but I hope it's enough.
I got this for you. It's nothing big, but I hope you like it. I want you to know I appreciate your friendship.
Here. Something I want you to have. Now, don't embarrass either of us by saying something sappy. Just... take it.
I've been wanting to say thanks for being a friend. Here. It's not much, but I was thinking you might like to have this.
So... I've been thinking... I'm grateful we're friends. I'd like you to have this. It's not much, but I hope it's something you like.
You're not tiresome like the rest of the people I have the displeasure of dealing with on a regular basis. Here. I'd like you to have this.
Yes?
Oh! Miss Maven. What can I do for you?
Relax, Marise... I have no quarrel with you. I just wish to speak a moment.
You watch the market, you hear the rumors around Riften. What have you heard about these dragons?
Interesting. Keep your ears open for me and tell me if you hear anything more. I'll make it worth your while.
I heard a traveler say that Helgen was destroyed by one of those creatures. Didn't leave a soul alive they said.
Argh!
Noooo!
Aaaaah!
Aggghh!
Gaaaah!
Weergh!
Grrargh!
Nyyarrggh!
power attack grunt
Down with you, damned worm!
Your doom has come, damned worm!
Use Dragonrend, to drag him down!
Today you die, your doom has come.
You fought well. I find you worthy.
Die, World-Eater, in despair and fear!
The joy of battle burns in your heart!
There is no escape. Courage is useless.
Shor's Hall awaits, if worthy you prove.
Nowhere to hide! Hunter becomes our prey!
I've waited long for such a worthy opponent.
Beware! The World-Eater waits within the mist!
For Skyrim! For Shor! For Sovngarde's freedom!
You may strike me down, but your doom is near.
The path is closed, till your courage is tested.
You cannot defeat us! The Dragonborn still stands!
Use Dragonrend, brothers! Bring him to swords-reach!
I may fall to your malice, but your fate is already written.
Hold, comrades - let us counsel take before battle is blindly joined.
Stand fast! The fell worm's death is ours at last, the light returns!
Felldir speaks wisdom - the World-Eater, coward, fears you, Dragonborn.
Prove worthy by warrior's test, and cross the bridge to the blessed hall.
Alduin's mist is more than a snare - its shadowy gloom is his shield and cloak.
None may pass this perilous bridge 'til I judge them worthy by the warrior's test.
But with four Voices joined, our valor combined, we can blast the mist and bring him to battle.
It is long since one of the living has entered here. May Shor's favor follow you and your errand.
What brings you, wayfarer grim, to wander here, in Sovngarde, souls-end, Shor's gift to honored dead?
Living or dead, by decree of Shor, none may pass this perilous bridge 'til I judge them worthy by the warrior's test.
We must drive away his mist, Shouting together, and then unsheathe our blades in desperate battle with our black-winged foe.
At long last! Alduin's doom is now ours to seal - just speak the word and with high hearts we'll hasten forth to smite the worm wherever he lurks.

Fine.
That's no business of yours, son. Mind you keep your nose out of it.

Greetings, Arch-Mage.
May I help you, Arch-Mage?
I don't know, not for sure.
I'm not certain what use it would be.
Another day, another opportunity to learn!
Are you quite sure we need to be speaking?
You know, they say knowledge is its own reward.
I hope I can count on you if I ever need a favor.
Arch-Mage or not, my rules about books still stand.
All right, let's give this a try. Ready your ward...
I am always available should you need me, Arch-Mage.
I think the College is due for a change in leadership.
Why are my research materials constantly disappearing?
I'm quite pleased that we're back to business as usual.
I've certainly learned more here than I ever expected to.
I'm working on some very important research, I assure you.
Tolfdir as Master Wizard. Certainly didn't anticipate that.
All this knowledge might have been lost, were it not for you.
If there's ever any way I can assist you, please let me know.
Khajiit are not known as mages, so J'zargo has much to prove.
I'm disappointed to say I've learned little during my time here.
If you need any help with Destruction spells, please let me know.
Illusion really is the least appreciated of the schools of magic.
Please don't bother the Arch-Mage unless it's absolutely necessary.
J'zargo had expected to be named Arch-Mage. But there is still time.
If you're working on any experiments, please clean up after yourself.
It's no secret that the College's reputation in Skyrim is... tainted.
I don't think anyone here truly understands how useful my work will be.
Are the Arch-Mage's robes as comfortable as J'zargo believes them to be?
It is not the place of the College to become involved in local politics.
May I just say, it's a pleasure to have you leading the College. Really.
The Arcanaeum is always accepting new volumes. I'll take what I can get.
I don't want to see you treating any of these books poorly. Are we clear?
I have many important things on my mind. Your concerns are not among them.
I still can't believe it. You, the Arch-Mage? Never would have guessed it.
Savos Aren is wise beyond his years. He knows real talent when he sees it.
What you learn here will last you a lifetime. Several, if you're talented.
Have you, by chance, seen my research notes? I seem to have misplaced them.
I wonder if the College's reptuation will ever recover from our adventures.
I wonder what we could've done with the Eye, had it been put to better use?
It's always encouraging to see the younger generations embracing education.
J'zargo will go wherever he can to learn more. Oblivion itself, if need be.
Perhaps we can go another few decades without a disaster. That would be nice.
If you ever need something, especially something hard to come by, let me know.
J'zargo is pleased, and more than a little jealous, to greet the new Arch-Mage.
The College will be here for you, no matter what. We always look after our own.
The people of Skyrim have no appreciation for what we do here. Not that I care.
We all have you to thank for saving the College. Your position is well-deserved.
Don't you think I'd make a wonderful Master Wizard? Maybe even Arch-Mage someday?
Just like anywhere else, it's all about who you know. Lucky for you, you know me.
Like it or not, you are a shining example to future generations of College Mages.
Certainly nothing illicit going on here, Arch-Mage. You can be quite sure of that.
When I've finished what I'm working on, everyone will understand its significance.
I'm sure when the time for promotions comes, they'll go to the most deserving mage.
Nords don't trust magic, or those that use it. Made it difficult for me growing up.
Certainly a few of my colleagues aren't quite as talented as they'd like to believe.
I think my parents reserved a spot for me here at the College on the day I was born.
If there are any problems, let me know. It's my job to keep things running smoothly.
If only I could be free of the mundane, day-to-day activities life so often requires.
I care little for idle conversation, but perhaps you need help with Conjuration magic?
I've spent a long time building up a list of contacts for goods from all over Tamriel.
There are few places where one can pursue my type of work without fear of persecution.
There are some experiments the College frowns on. If they're aware of them, of course.
Just because I don't fit in here is no reason for others to ridicule me behind my back.
Education is never appreciated until after the fact. Young people never understand this.
That 'incident' in Morthal was just a misunderstanding. No matter what the guards claim.
The Arch-Mage triumphant! The College... Skyrim... All of Tamriel owes you a great debt!
I don't care if you wrote it yourself -- if you want a book from here, you go through me.
I'm not one for commendations, but I might've lost everything that matters. So... thanks.
The exact nature of my research is a secret, I'm afraid, but it really is quite valuable.
I'm sure you've made note of who's been the most helpful during your time here, Arch-Mage.
Restoration is a perfectly valid school of magic, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
You need a book, you talk to me. Otherwise you're going to find yourself in a lot of pain.
After all that it's been through, the College still stands. In no small part thanks to you!
Once again, I have found very insulting notes left in my personal effects. Simply barbaric.
Enchanting services are one of the few things that keep us in touch with the rest of Skyrim.
Even with the College's laid-back attitude, there are still some things that are off-limits.
Please don't do anything to anger the locals. They don't need additional reasons to hate us.
If he could, Savos would float the the entire College above Skyrim, for all the Nords to see.
The Eye of Magnus. Here, but lost. Slipped through our grasp. Oh, what we might have learned.
Don't expect the local Nords to take kindly to you once they find out you're from the College.
I had hoped your scholars would be on a level comparable with my own colleagues. They are not.
Mine is not a popular position, but someone needs to keep things running smoothly around here.
There's a lot of pressure for me to excel in my studies. I hope I can live up to expectations.
I think we could blow up half of Eastmarch, and people would still come to us for enchantments.
It's a small group of us here at the College. Favors don't go unremembered. Neither do affronts.
Mirabelle does a fine job as Master Wizard, I suppose. Still, there's always room for improvement.
Someday the College may be fully accepted by the Nords. I hope that my work as Arch-Mage may help.
The College is a bit of an oddity in Skyrim. Magic isn't something that's looked upon fondly here.
Savos doesn't care for politics. He likes to believe the College is removed from the rest of Skyrim.
Day-to-day operations are my responsibility, which means if you become a problem, you get sent to me.
Hundreds of years have gone into assembling this collection. It's going to stay pristine, understand?
Skyrim couldn't be more different from Elsweyr. But magic... Magic's the same no matter where you go.
We have survived difficult times, and are better mages for it. We owe you that, Arch-Mage. Thank you.
I can't wait to see who succeeds Mirabelle. I've no doubt she'll be promoted to Arch-Mage at some point.
Should you ever fall victim to an unfortunate accident, I promise your remains will be put to good use...
Nasty business with that Ancano fellow. Pity that I was unable to assist, but I was... otherwise occupied.
You know, this is one of a very few places where you can receive a real education in the schools of magic.
They won't say much, but most people have very strong opinions about the College and those that study here.
Like it or not, this College is a direct influence on the public's impressions of magic and those that use it.
And to think, Mirabelle questioned my allowing you into the College. I can just imagine the look on her face now.
The local Nords may not like us very much, but they don't seem to mind having access to enchanted weapons and armor.
Ancano is exactly why we're so restrictive about access to the College. We'd all have perished if it weren't for you.
But perhaps the staff can absorb some of the energy coming out of the Eye, weaken it. Allow us to get close to Ancano.
It is up to each of us to present ourselves publicly as maturely as possible, and to remain above petty local squabbles.
J'zargo can learn magic from these men and elves, but they cannot learn to be as dashing as he. J'zargo comes out on top.
Thanks to you, the people of Skyrim will continue to have a place to study magic. Even if most of them resent you for it.
Have you seen Mirabelle around? I know she's dead, but I thought... Well, I thought she might stop in and say hello anyway.
I never would have suspected that the Eye could be so dangerous. Tolfdir is right, isn't he? Magic really can overwhelm you.
The Staff is said to be able to absorb great amounts of energy. Perhaps it can interact with the Eye in a way that nothing else can.
Good.
Halt!
Whoa!
Dragon!
Archers!
Justice!
Let's go.
This way.
Follow me.
Hear that?
Move! Move!
As you wish.
Damn rebels.
Ever onward.
Stormcloaks!
Who are you?
Almost there.
Imperial dogs!
Next, the cat!
Next, the Orc!
What was that?
(muffled grunts)
Divines help us!
Why do you care?
Easy does it now.
Next, the Breton!
Next, the lizard!
What's happening?
Come on, hurry up.
Come on, this way.
Don't fall behind!
It's still coming!
Let's keep moving.
Let's see here....
This way, come on!
This way. Come on!
Get this gate open.
It's in the clouds!
Next, the dark elf!
Next, the high elf!
Next, the Redguard!
Next, the wood elf!
Ralof of Riverwood.
Shut up back there!
Victory... for now.
BLANK LINE- NO AUDIO
Death to the Empire!
Let's cut you loose.
Lokir of Rorikstead.
Why are we stopping?
Done, then? This way!
EMPTY LINE - NO AUDIO
Fall, damn you, fall!
Freedom or Sovngarde!
Keep your eyes on it!
See you in Sovngarde.
We better keep going.
Whew. That was close.
Yes, General Tullius.
For Ulfric and Skyrim!
I said, next prisoner!
Inside the house. Now.
Stormcloaks! Get them!
You Imperial bastards!
Done? Let's get moving.
It's nothing. Carry on.
Use everything we have!
We have to keep moving.
By your orders, Captain.
This looks like the way.
What next, giant snakes?
You won't take us alive!
Death to the Stormcloaks!
That the best Ulfric has?
Was Jarl Ulfric with you?
What in Oblivion is that?
You better get some gear.
Let's see where this goes.
Sentries! What do you see?
Sneaking is overrated, eh?
By the gods, a dragon! How?
By Ysmir! Nothing kills it!
Give them their last rites.
It's the escaped prisoners!
Next, the Nord in the rags!
No! Wait! We're not rebels!
Not the sneaking type, huh?
The prisoners are escaping!
No going back that way, now.
You're not going to kill me!
Another day, another victory.
Follow the Captain, prisoner.
If you want to die, so be it.
Stormcloaks! Filthy traitors!
That's how the Legion fights.
You won't leave Helgen alive!
Anyone else feel like running?
Come on, soldier. Keep moving!
Empire loves their damn lists.
Hmm. That doesn't go anywhere.
How does it move so damn fast?
That's how a true Nord fights.
Wait. You there. Step forward.
And what's wrong with him, huh?
Good. Let's get this over with.
Hey, you. You're finally awake.
It's the Imperials! Take cover!
There's a way out through here!
Damn it. No going back that way.
Grab what you can, and let's go.
Hold on, now, we only want to...
Just give the General some time!
See if you can unlock that door.
I guess we'd better try this way.
Next, the renegade from Cyrodiil!
Sure, take all my things. Please.
Come on, you need your hands free.
Grab anything useful and let's go.
It has been an honor, Jarl Ulfric!
That the best the Legion has? Heh.
Why do you think? End of the line.
Why? I want to watch the soldiers.
You need to go inside, little cub.
Better to stick together down here.
Come on, I haven't got all morning.
Die! For the love of the gods, die!
It won't die, it just keeps coming!
Troll's blood! It's a torture room.
You have no authority over me, boy.
Just give me a minute. Let me think.
Ulfric Stormcloak. Jarl of Windhelm.
Don't let those Stormcloaks get away!
There it is again. Did you hear that?
A dragon? It's a dragon! Gods help us!
Forget the list. He goes to the block.
Guards, get the townspeople to safety!
How in Oblivion do we kill this thing?
To the block, prisoner. Nice and easy.
As fearless in death as he was in life.
Damn, that dragon doesn't give up easy.
Forget the list. She goes to the block.
Forget the old man. I'll come with you.
Let me see if I can get that door open.
No, I'm not a rebel. You can't do this!
Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.
We'll meet again in Sovngarde, brother.
What does it take to kill this monster?
Damn. No way to open this from our side.
Don't just stand there! Kill that thing!
I just need to gather some more potions.
There's no way out that way, you know...
What in the Eight Divines is this thing?
A dragon? Please. Don't make up nonsense.
A Nord's last thoughts should be of home.
Come with us. We need to get out of here.
Face your death with some courage, thief.
Maybe one of these Imperials had the key.
Someone get the battlemages out here. Now!
Who are they, daddy? Where are they going?
Hey, what village are you from horse thief?
Let's go on ahead. See if the way is clear.
Looks like the way out's up ahead. Come on.
Looks like we're the only ones who made it.
Those binds aren't going to cut themselves.
Unlock that door and let's get out of here.
Hold up. There's a bear just ahead. See her?
It's the End Times! The End Times have come!
Just give me a minute... I'm out of breath...
So that's why you were in the cart. Thieving.
This one's locked. Let's see about that gate.
All right, let's see if we can find a way out.
General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!
Get these prisoners out of the carts. Move it!
Did you find a key? See if it unlocks that door.
Shor's bones. We were too late. Damn the Empire.
Captain. What should we do? He's not on the list.
Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us.
Let's keep moving. That thing is still out there.
Orders are to wait until General Tullius arrives.
That looks like the way out! I knew we'd make it!
Captain. What should we do? She's not on the list.
I hate those damn things. Too many eyes, you know?
No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up.
No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening.
See if one of these chests has some armor for you.
Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor.
We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.
Didn't you hear me? I said the keep is under attack!
Go ahead. I'll follow your lead and watch your back.
I'm going to see if I can find some way out of here.
I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.
Hear that? Stormcloaks. Maybe we can reason with them.
I'm sorry. At least you'll die here, in your homeland.
What are you doing? We need to get out of Helgen. Now!
You picked a bad time to come home to Skyrim, kinsman.
I guess we're lucky that didn't come down on top of us.
The torture room. Gods, I wish we didn't need these....
I'll never get tired of killing these Imperial bastards.
Grab Gunjar's gear. No shame in borrowing a friend's axe.
Not many wood elves would choose to come alone to Skyrim.
Wait a second. Looks like there's something in this cage.
A storeroom. Grab anything you can, but let's keep moving.
Here we are, found a key. Let's see if it opens that door.
All right, get that armor on and give that axe a few swings.
For the love of Talos, shut up and let's get this over with.
Got to be a sword or two in one of these chests. Look around.
I better stay back and see to the old man. Good luck you two.
Step towards the block when we call your name. One at a time.
Where in Oblivion are we supposed to go? Where's the way out?
A storeroom. See if you can find any potions. We'll need them.
You from Daggerfall, Breton? Fleeing from some court intrigue?
You from one of the strongholds, Orc? How did you end up here?
An old storeroom. Grab anything you can, but let's keep moving.
Are you a relative of one of the Riften dock workers, Argonian?
I'll stay here and wait for General Tullius. Good luck you two.
I'm not waiting to be killed by a dragon! We need to fall back!
These Imperials have potions in here. We're going to need them.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Elsweyr.
My ancestors are smiling at me, Imperials. Can you say the same?
Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.
We need to get moving! That dragon is tearing up the whole keep!
You better get that armor on. Give that sword a few swings, too.
You've got to tell them! We weren't with you! This is a mistake!
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Cyrodiil.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Orsinium.
That armor on Gunjar isn't doing him any good. Go ahead. Take it.
Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion.
Another refugee? Gods really have abandoned your people, dark elf.
But if they've captured you.... Oh gods, where are they taking us?
Don't you even know what's going on? A dragon is attacking Helgen!
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to High Rock.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Morrowind.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Valenwood.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Hammerfell.
We'd better push on. I'm sure the others will find another way out.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to Black Marsh.
You're a long way from the Imperial City. What're you doing in Skyrim?
An old storeroom. See if you can find some potions. Might come in handy.
We'd better push on. The rest of them will have to find another way out.
I'm sorry. We'll make sure your remains are returned to the Summerset Isle.
This looks like the way out! I was starting to wonder if we'd ever make it.
Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King.
We better get moving. Come here. Let me see if I can get those bindings off.
See if you can get it open with some picks. We'll need everything we can get.
We should keep moving. Come here. Let me see if I can get those bindings off.
Don't bother with that. Lost the key ages ago. Poor fellow screamed for weeks.
Or if you're feeling lucky, you can take this bow. Might take her by surprise.
What're you doing here, Redguard? You a sellsword? A sailor from Stros M'kai?
I'll keep watch in case Ulfric comes through here. Talos guide the both of you.
Funny, when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.
Gunjar isn't coming back from the dead. Take his armor and anything else on him.
Although, come to think of it, I did hear some odd noises coming from over there.
There you go. You may as well take Gunjar's gear. He won't be needing it any more.
You're not with the Thalmor Embassy, are you high elf? No, that can't be right....
Grab everything important and let's move! Dragon's burning everything to the ground!
You with one of the trade caravans, Khajiit? Your kind always seems to find trouble.
Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy.
You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell.
And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.
It's locked. See if you can get it open with some picks. We might need that gold once we get out.
Looks like we're the only ones who made it. Was that really a dragon? The bringers of the End Times?
You'd better get out of that Stormcloak gear. Today's not the day to go around dressed like a rebel.
That's it! Come on, let's get out of here before the dragon brings the whole tower down on our heads.
You fellows happened along just in time. These boys seemed a bit upset at how I've been entertaining their comrades.
You started this war, plunged Skyrim into chaos, and now the Empire is going to put you down, and restore the peace.
That thing was a dragon. No doubt. Just like the children's stories and the legends. The harbingers of the End Times.
I'd rather not tangle with her right now. Let's try to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and watch where you step.
You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.
I'd rather not tangle with her right now. We might be able to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and watch where you step.
This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in.
As we commend your souls to Aetherius, blessings of the Eight Divines upon you, for you are the salt and earth of Nirn, our beloved....
There you go. Take a look around, there should be plenty of gear to choose from. I'm going to see if I can find something for these burns.
Ulfric Stormcloak. Some here in Helgen call you a hero. But a hero doesn't use a power like the Voice to murder his king and usurp his throne.
Here.
I have vowed to serve Amaund Motierre until my dying breath. Best remember that.
Hmph.
Dismissed.
Take care.
As you were.
Watch yourself.
Go with the gods.
You're dismissed.
Be careful out there.
Talos watch over you.
Go on, get out of here.
Keep your brother, and he'll keep you.
Hyah!
No, damn you!
You are banished!
What else is there?
Skyrim will be free!
My time has come again.
Ruth wah nivahriin joor!
But first... dir ko maar.
Maar saraan ko Sovngarde.
Faal Kel...?! Nikriinne...
It worked... you did it...
Use Dragonrend, Dovahkiin!
Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor.
Unslaad hokoron! Never again!
Hurt him while he is grounded!
You are no match for me, joor!
You will pay for your defiance!
Felldir! We agreed not to use it!
Hakon! A glorious day, is it not!
My teeth to your neck, Dovahkiin!
Paarthurnax is weak. I am strong.
You are no match for me, Dovahkiin.
Lost funt. You are too late, Alduin!
Now, Dovahkiin! Now he is vulnerable!
wordless dragon roar of pain and anger
I will feast on your soul in Sovngarde!
I have feasted on many greater than you.
Which is why I brought the Elder Scroll.
Die now and await your fate in Sovngarde!
If I die today, it will not be in terror.
Dovahkiin! Use Dragonrend, if you know it!
It's no use! Use the Scroll, Felldir! Now!
Know that Gormlaith sent you down to death!
Meyz mul, Dovahkiin. You have become strong.
We shall see soon enough. Alduin approaches!
Dovahkiin, you call yourself? Arrogant mortal.
To feed my power when I come for you in Sovngarde!
You will die in terror, knowing your final fate...
You worry too much, brother. Victory will be ours.
Gormlaith! We're running out of time! The battle...
Use Dragonrend! It is the only chance to defeat him!
Let those that watch from Sovngarde envy us this day!
No. We will deal with Alduin ourselves, here and now.
Have you no thought beyond the blooding of your blade?
Aav uv dir. Join me or perish with your mortal friends.
I never agreed. And if you are right, I will not need it.
Meyye! Tahrodiis aanne! Him hinde pah liiv! Zu'u hin daan!
This is your chance, Dovahkiin! Strike with all your force!
You cannot prevail against me. I will outlast you... mortal!
But I honor your courage. Krif voth ahkrin. Die now, in vain.
You feel fear for the first time, worm. I see it in your eyes.
Dovahkiin, vosaraan! Use Dragonrend before Alduin consumes you!
He is too strong on the wing! Bring him to gol with Dragonrend!
Suleyki mulaag, Paarthurnax. My power has waxed, while yours has waned.
Yes, the World-Eater is gone... may the spirits have mercy on our souls.
But none have yet stood against Alduin himself. Galthor, Sorri, Birkir...
Daar sul thur se Alduin vokrii. Today Alduin's lordship will be restored.
You are banished! Alduin, we shout you out from all our endings unto the last!
We've bloodied him well. Four of his kin have fallen to my blade alone this day.
He will come. He cannot ignore our defiance. And why should he fear us, even now?
Why does Alduin hang back? We've staked everything on this plan of yours, old man.
You may have picked up the weapons of my ancient foes, but you are not their equal!
They did not have Dragonrend. Once we bring him down, I promise I will have his head.
Bahloki nahkip sillesejoor. My belly is full of the souls of your fellow mortals, Dovahkiin.
The battle below goes ill. If Alduin does not rise to our challenge, I fear all may be lost.
You do not understand. Alduin cannot be slain like a lesser dragon. He is beyond our strength.
Hold, Alduin on the Wing! Sister Hawk, grant us your sacred breath to make this contract heard!
But I am Al-du-in, Firstborn of Akatosh! Mulaagi zok lot! I cannot be slain here, by you or anyone else!
Begone, World-Eater! By words with older bones than your own we break your perch on this age and send you out!
Nivahriin joorre! What have you done? What twisted Words have you created?! Tahrodiis Paarthurnax! My teeth to his neck!
I do.
Do you wish to become a Blade?
You there. The Dragonborn wishes to give you the chance to join the lost guardians of Tamriel. The dragon slayers. The Blades.
Then by my right as acting grandmaster, I name you a Blade, with all the privileges, rights, and burdens that brings. Godspeed.
Are you willing to trade away all claims and titles of your former life? To live here and devote yourself to protecting Tamriel from danger?
Kill.
Must...kill.
Free...again.
You...must...die.
Moan, done as a zombie
Grunt reaction, done as a zombie
Grunt of effort, done as a zombie
Big grunt of effort, done as a zombie
Liar!
Booooo.
Traitor!
Positions.
Cut em down!
He died well.
Get on with it.
You betrayed us!
Stormcloak lover.
Lock the city gate.
Let's be done with it!
I don't need your help.
I think I expected more.
Some gate guard you were!
You're all heart, Vivienne.
Guard. Prepare the prisoner.
He doesn't deserve to speak!
It shouldn't have been like this.
On this day... I go to Sovngarde.
Very well, Roggvir. Bow your head.
Good riddance to bad rubbish I say.
Last warning. Stand back from the execution.
Please step back, there's an execution in process.
They can't hurt uncle Roggvir. Tell them he didn't do it.
By opening that gate for Ulfric you betrayed the people of Solitude.
Such is our way! Such is the ancient custom of Skyrim, and all Nords!
Svari, you need to go home. Go home and stay there until your mother comes.
There was no murder! Ulfric challenged Torygg. He beat the High King in fair combat.
Roggvir. You helped Ulfric Stormcloak escape this city after he murdered High King Torygg.
You should tell her that her uncle is scum that betrayed his High King. Best she know now, Addvar.
Liar.
Move!
Torolf!
Go! Now!
In here!
Get back!
Let's go!
This way!
Get going!
Over here!
Get moving!
Keep firing!
Jump! Come on!
Run, you idiot!
Come on, this way!
This way! Come on!
To the keep! Move!
Move! Up the tower!
Quickly, follow me!
You still here? Go!
Everyone to the keep!
Get up, papa! Get up!
Through the inn! Now!
We need to move. Now!
Get off the road, boy!
Haming, get over here!
With me, up the tower!
Gods guide you, Hadvar.
Stay close to the wall!
This way, friend! Move!
Through here. Let's go!
Up the stairs! Quickly!
Gods... Everyone get back!
General Tullius, over here!
With me, prisoner. Let's go!
You! Come on, into the keep!
Go! We'll follow when we can!
We've got to get inside. Now!
What are you waiting for? Go!
I want every arrow in the sky!
Just walk towards me, come on!
That's it, son. Make me proud.
Come on! We need to get inside!
Lead with those arrows, dammit!
That a boy. You're doing great.
They're hurt, but they'll live.
Up through the tower, let's go!
Tell my family I fought bravely.
Legends don't burn down villages.
I can cut you loose inside. Come on!
Thought I told you to run for it! Go!
What are you doing? Get off the road!
It's you and me, prisoner. Stay close!
Haming, you need to get over here. Now!
I'm done for, little cub. Go. Run for it!
Ralof! You damned traitor. Out of my way!
Quick, I can cut you loose inside the keep.
Damn you mages! Aren't you good for anything?
We'll have to carry this one on our backs....
What are you waiting for? Up the stairs! Now!
Hadvar! Into the keep, soldier, we're leaving!
Don't look up. Just focus on me. You can do it!
Soldiers, townspeople, and dregs into the keep!
It's too late for that. Leave me. Save yourself.
Where are you going? The barracks is through here!
The wounds are deep, Vilod! I can't stop the blood.
Fine. I hope that dragon takes you all to Sovngarde.
Come on! Before the dragon brings down the whole tower!
Come on. Give me your hand, I'm getting you out of here.
We're escaping, Hadvar. You're not stopping us this time.
We just need to move some of these rocks to clear the way!
Jarl Ulfric! What is that thing? Could the legends be true?
Has everyone here forgotten their training? Kill that thing!
Hey, Orc. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, you. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, Breton. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
See the inn on the other side? Jump through the roof and keep going!
Another second out there with the dragon, and they'd both be dead....
Hey, Khajiit. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, kinsman. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Still alive, prisoner? Keep close to me if you want to stay that way.
Hey, Argonian. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, dark elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, high elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, Redguard. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
Hey, wood elf. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!
What? Do you want to be that thing's next meal? Into the keep, already!
Gunnar, take care of the boy. I have to find General Tullius and join the defense.
Nice!
Come on!
Get him!
Chop chop!
Hey, a fight!
Pull him back!
Watch the eyes!
Just keep swinging!
Get in there and push!
Are those two at it again?
Just keep moving, you'll wear him out!
Come on now, watch the footwork. Keep your balance.
Strike when the shoulder turns. He's giving you openings!
No...
Damn. We've got trouble.
Hsss! Dead. Who did this?
Damn it, this will not stand!
Well now, this is unexpected...
By Ysmir! There's a killer about.
A...a body! How absolutely terrible.
We've got a murderer on the loose...
Dead! Someone's going to pay for this.
I'll claw the eyes out of whoever did this!
What? Someone will suffer for this injustice.
What...? No... No, this can't be happening...
Murdered? By Azura, who would do such a thing?
Sovngarde take your soul. I'll avenge your body.
I'm going to find whoever did this, and when I do...
Hmph. Looks like we got a cutthroat skulkin' around...
Ain't nothing pretty about a corpse. No matter how fresh.
What...? Whoever did this, you're dead. You hear me? Dead!
Your body lies dead, but your soul has joined our ranks...
Kill one of us, and three more will take their place. The Forsworn are unstoppable.
Freshly killed. Whoever did this is still close... and will suffer for their insolence.
Nord.
Breton.
Khajiit.
Tidings.
Y...Yes?
Argonian.
Hi there.
Imperial.
Redguard.
Yes, sera?
Speak, elf.
Well hello.
What now...
Yeah? What?
Out with it.
Good evening.
I'm all ears.
Make it quick.
Speak quickly.
Good afternoon.
You have questions?
Got somethin' to say?
How can I assist, hmm?
This better be good...
What do you want, cat?
What're you lookin' at?
What are you starin' at?
This one needs something?
What do you want, lizard?
Oh, did you need something?
What do you need, handsome?
What do you want, Imperial?
You want something from me?
I don't owe you money, do I?
And what might you need? Hmm?
What do you want, little elf?
Come, come. I haven't got all day.
Yes, yes. I haven't got all day...
Is there... something I can do for you?
Okay.
It's not true, I assure you.
I don't know. Someone in town said it.
What? Where did you hear such a thing?
Don't believe everything you hear, child.
Is it true that you kill deer and eat their hearts?
Olaf!
Olaf! It is time!
Insolent bard. Die!
Arise, Olaf! My vengeance is at hand!
Pity.
Shhh!
He he he.
He'll never find me here.
She'll never find me here.
This is a good hiding spot.
Shhh.
It will be so.
Do you feel that?
You're right. We're not alone.
Sigh.
I have plenty of room in my bed.
So, Tythis... you coming by the Bunkhouse later?
Of course. I rented a bed there. Where else would I sleep?
Good, that must be very comfortable for you. I think mine's a bit too small. Perhaps we could trade?
Soon.
We're ready when you are.
I fight... because I must.
The people are behind you.
And what would you have me do?
How long are you going to wait?
They have families to think of.
What's left of Skyrim to wager?
He knows that. They all know that.
Many I fear still need convincing.
He's a true Nord. He'll come around.
If he's not with us, he's against us.
Hrongar won't give us a straight answer.
Balgruuf won't give us a straight answer.
Then let them die with their false kings.
Aye. But in the meantime, we have a war to plan.
So we're ready to start this war in earnest then?
Yes, but why do you fight? If not for me, what then?
You think I need to send Hrongar a stronger message.
You think I need to send Balgruuf a stronger message.
I'd follow you into the depths of Oblivion, you know that.
If by message you mean shoving a sword through his gullet.
Well put, friend. Tell me, Galmar, why do you fight for me?
I would gladly retire from the world were such a day to dawn.
I fight for the men I've held in my arms, dying on foreign soil.
I still say you should take them all out like you did Deadking Torygg.
I'll die before elves dictate the fates of men. Are we not one in this?
I fight so that all the fighting I've already done hasn't been for nothing.
How many of their sons and daughters follow your banner? We are their families.
But the day words are enough, will be the day when soldiers like us are no longer needed.
Your words give voice to what we all feel, Ulfric. And that's why you will be High King.
I fight for their wives and children, who's names I heard whispered in their last breaths.
Things hinge on Whiterun. If we can take the city without bloodshed all the better. But if not...
Taking his city and leaving him in disgrace would make a more powerful statement, don't you think?
I fight for we few who did come home, only to find our country full of strangers wearing familiar faces.
Torygg was merely a message to the other Jarls. Whoever we replace them with will need the support of our armies.
We've been soldiers a long time. We know the price of freedom. The people are still weighing things in their hearts.
Don't be so sure of that. We've intercepted couriers from Solitude. The Empire's putting a great deal of pressure on Whiterun.
I fight for my people impoverished to pay the debts of an Empire too weak to rule them, yet brands them criminals for wanting to rule themselves!
Uhhh.
Um...
Now keep going.
Mortal? Insufferable.
...but only during... the day?
So congratulations! You're free to go!
But someone still has quite a bit to do. Hmmm?
But you're not done yet. And you could still die...
You... didn't mean... yourself. You meant... Pelagius...
I... have been known to change my mind. So... go. Really.
Conquering paranoia should be a snap after that ordeal, hmm?
Honestly, I can't keep up. But by all means, don't stop now.
But you're not out of the woods yet! Get it? Out of the woods?
Oh! That's right! Pelagius! Yes, yes, now I recall. Well done, well done.
Yes, yes, you're entirely brilliant. Conquering madness and all that. Blah blah blah.
Um... We're not talking about Barbas, are we? Clavicus Vile's... dog? Oohh... awkward.
Well! Same congratulations apply! Just, you know, for what you did for the insane emperor.
Oh... lovely. Now all my dear Pelagius has to worry about are the several hundred legitimate threats...
Ah, wonderful, wonderful! Why waste all that hatred on yourself when it can so easily be directed at others!
Ah, so now my dear Pelagius can hate himself for being legitimately afraid of things that actually threaten his existence...
Ah! Good, good! No more barking at all hours, and chewing up my slippers. You used the hemlock, then? Damned good idea! I...
Oh, I am so happy for you! My, what a burden to have carried. But you've done it! You've conquered your own inner demons! Bravo!
Ah, but no matter. Heartless mortal that you are, you've actually succeeded and survived. I am forced to honor my end of the bargain.
Hmmmm... [QUOTE]Fixed[QUOTE] is such a subjective term. I think [QUOTE]treated[QUOTE] is far more appropriate, don't you? Like one does to a rash, or an arrow in the face.
What?
I would suggest that you not further spread this rumor.
I have made it quite clear that my only role here is as an advisor to the Arch-Mage.
Preposterous, and just the sort of thing I would expect from mages who have nothing better to do with their time.
Whoa.
Brilliant!
Colorful...
Oh, such colors!
Oooh... pretty colors.
Oh, look at the colors!
What a display of color!
Wow! Look at all the colors!
Keep that magic away from me.
Is that magic? Careful, please...
Well hey, that's not something you see every day.
Woof.
Hello there, miss.
Barbas, at your service.
Well, well. Hello there, big man.
You have business with Clavicus Vile?
Ah, you've got the axe! And my dog. Splendid.
Ah, there you are. I've been waiting for you to arrive.
Collect the Rueful Axe from Rimerock Burrow, and I believe we'll have a deal.
It's nice to be rid of that detestable dog. Things are so much more fun without his incessant preaching.
Yarr!
Avast, dog!
Die, ya cowardly lubber!
Yeah?
I'm listenin'.
Need something?
We haven't met.
What's going on?
Come here a second.
What's on your mind?
Hey, good to see you!
Let's talk for moment.
Did you want something?
Want to talk? Go ahead.
Well? You done or what?
Oh, this should be good.
Hey, let's talk a second.
Yeah, you need something?
Looking to fix your armor?
Out with it. Time is money.
Sure, we can talk a minute.
Back with good news I trust.
I have no business with you.
I'm busy, is this important?
You want to talk to me? Okay.
So, what can I do for ya today?
Wanted to say something to you.
Pull up a seat and have a drink.
Are you bothering me for a reason?
Hey, I want to talk to you... now.
Steal anything worth talking about?
My sister in crime. What'd you need?
Something troublin' ya? I'll listen.
Got a minute? Wanted to say something.
Got lots of jobs available. Interested?
I have work if you've got the backbone.
Interest you in some marksman training?
My brother in crime... what'd you need?
Back from a job, huh? Hope it went well.
Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying.
I'm busy. Don't you have something to do?
This better be important, I'm quite busy.
I'm busy right now, lad. We can talk later.
I'm busy right now, lass. We can talk later.
Need some gold? I may have some work for you.
Hey, how's it going. Need pickpocket training?
Well, hey there. What can Sapphire do for you?
Always a pleasure, boss. What can I do for you?
Been doing a few jobs for Vex... how about you?
Hmph, so you're the one everyone's falling over.
Yeah, I guess I have a minute. What do you want?
Be glad to repair any damage to your Guild armor.
Come back later and I may have some work for you.
If you need pickpocket training, just let me know.
So, feeling loose? How about you run a job for me.
Don't you have better things to do than disturb me?
Looking for the best smith in Skyrim? You found it.
Talk to me again if you prove yourself to Brynjolf.
They call me Sapphire because I love to steal them.
Need a few spare septims? I got the cure right here.
Skilled, lethal and good-looking. Yep, it's a curse.
Name's Rune. Yeah, rune... just like you're thinking.
I sell all sorts of poisons for almost every occasion.
Something I can help with or do you just want to talk?
Still learning the ropes, but I'll get the hang of it.
Can I interest you in anything? Some fine armor perhaps?
I think Brynjolf can give you all the information you need.
After you talk to Brynjolf and Mercer, come back and see me.
Our Guild Master graces me with a visit. What can I do for you?
Ready for some work or you just going to wander around all day?
When people ask my real name, know what I tell them? Don't ask.
You need advice? Talk to Brynjolf... I got better things to do.
Need your weapon repaired? Or could I interest you in a new one?
I don't miss home one bit. I'm glad to leave that life behind me.
I'm not here to hold your hand. Figure this one out for yourself.
So, name your poison! Ha ha ha. Oh, I never get tired of that one!
They don't call me the Ember-Master for nothing. What do you need?
If you want to be a master pickpocket like me, I can get you there.
Have no idea what my birth name really is, and I frankly don't care.
Need some sort of toxin for a special occasion? That's where I come in.
Sorry, lad... I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time.
Sure I might have some dirt in my past, but that's just ancient history.
I don't care if Vex was chosen as a Guild Third over me, she deserved it.
Name's Garthar. Remember it, because you're going to hear a lot about me.
Sorry, lass... I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time.
I think you better listen to Mercer and Brynjolf first. We can talk later.
I've been a part of this Guild for as long as Mercer has been Guild Master.
Last time someone cheated me, I cut off their hand. Still have it actually.
I wouldn't mind teaching the ways of the pickpocket... if the gold was right.
I've got all sorts of weapons for the discerning marksman. What can I get you?
I kind of like watching things from where I am. Making money is all I care about.
I've seen a lot of thieves come and go, but I've never seen anyone as good as me.
If you need marksman training, and you've got the coin... I'm ready to teach you.
It's not hard to fit in and make friends when you have the coin to make it happen.
Still have quite a good bit of jobs available if you're looking for some extra coin.
So, you're the one Brynjolf's been jabberin' about. Been waitin' to have a word with you.
I'm glad Brynjolf decided to let me join. Been trying to make some coin for him ever since.
If you wondering why they call me Vipir the Fleet, watch me outrun the town guard sometime.
I don't bother with silly pickpocketing jobs when I can make far more at the gambling table.
Ugh. The wine in Skyrim tastes like urine compared to the fine vintages we had in Valenwood.
Being brought up by a poor family, I had to learn how to steal if I wanted to make ends meet.
Brynjolf pulled me in a few years ago. Said the Guild was lacking some muscle, so I joined up.
I'm the heavy hitter around here. When someone needs pushing around, I'm the one they send in.
If you're in the market for the finest bows money can buy, you're talking to the right person.
My specialty is pickpocketing. All I need is a rich mark, a moon-lit sky and I'm in my element.
So, you're the new recruit everyone's been talking about, eh? I guess it's about time we talked.
I could crack the lock on any house blindfolded before you even got your picks out of your pocket.
I might not be as big as some of my fellow Nords, but in a fight they can barely lay a hand on me.
Of course you can buy me a drink... you didn't need to say a word, but I heard you loud and clear.
I'm a deadeye marksman, lethal with a blade and dangerous in bed. And it only gets better from there.
A lot of people are beginning to get impressed with you here. Me included. Just wanted to let you know.
You're making waves around here. I like that. If you ever want to talk about anything, you let me know.
I've busted heads for Maven Black-Briar when she wants to keep her name out of it. Pays good, so why not?
Look, if I was a little harsh before, I just wanted you to know it's because you were new. Know what I mean?
I miss the glory days of this place. We had more coin stacked in the vaults than we even knew what to do with.
I leave all that sneaking around nonsense to everyone else; believe me, when I'm coming for you... you'll know it.
I don't know, you don't look so impressive to me. I mean, you're no Gray Fox, but you must be doing something right.
Used to run with a bandit clan in The Pale. Turns out I didn't like them and they didn't like me, so we parted ways.
I think you're all right. In fact, I'm kind of impressed how well you're doing around here. Just keep it between us, okay?
I'd much rather earn a living liberating others of their coin this way than spending my days as a carpenter like my father.
I've never seen anyone with skills like yours. I just wanted to let you know that if you need anything, you can talk to me.
Brynjolf actually caught me trying to pick his pocket in the market. If he was anyone else I would have gotten away with it.
Been in the Guild a long time... joined right after Brynjolf. Not interested in leadership though, that's more his kind of thing.
Don't get me wrong, I'll steal any gem that isn't nailed down. But there's something about those blue stones that gets my blood boiling.
You're pretty tough, I respect that. Bringing in a lot of coin for the Guild, making us look good too. Let me know if you need anything, okay?
(bark)
(sigh)
No. Not really.
The forge is hot today.
Not hot enough. Does your Skyrim ever get warm, husband?
(Sigh)
Typical Nord. Beard for brains.
Imperial spies? You can't be serious!
If anything actually happens, call a guard.
Well, my friend, you did not know Ysgramor.
But we haven't taken a side because it's not our fight.
No, child! Wait! That boy, that house - they're cursed.
You're a war hero, Brunwulf. Ulfric will listen to you.
Ha! Then I'm right. I knew it. He's trying to have somebody killed!
Oh my, I very nearly got us both into a nasty predicament, didn't I?
A few dark elves getting shoved around doesn't really amount to much.
Ah, now here is an item out of legend. This is Ysgramor's Soup Spoon.
What macabre mysteries would these tools reveal if they could but speak?
Now. Enough. We will speak no more of this. I am the only friend you need.
I'll speak to Ulfric soon, but I make no promises that I can change his mind.
Don't let this innocent-looking flute fool you, for this is the Dancer's Pipe.
Here is the Book of Fate, discovered in a secret room in the Arcane University.
To activate this strange power, one must only speak the magic words, which are...
Oh, Grimvar... always with the nonsense. No, no, of course not. Those are just tales...
My men have their orders. But it's a big city, and there's a war on. Plus these murders.
Fine. Then I'll invite him out to play. He lives right there. I'm going to knock on his door...
Hey, maybe the reason these gray-skins don't help in the war is because they're Imperial spies!
If the guards in the Gray Quarter weren't a bunch of n'wahs, I wouldn't be here talking to you.
Maybe we'll pay you a visit tonight, little spy. We got ways of finding out what you really are.
And with that, the tour is over. I thank you for your patronage, and I hope to see you again soon!
Now, I know what you're thinking - this is no spoon, it's a fork! Nobody can eat soup with a fork!
Most scholars believe that the Nords of old used these implements to prepare their dead for burial.
It's not that simple. Ulfric wants a Skyrim for the Nords. He doesn't trust what he calls outsiders.
Legend holds that the Dancer's Pipe has won wars, toppled empires and changed the very course of history.
Watch that tongue, Rendar, or your whole lot could be down with the Argonians hauling ballast by tomorrow.
The writing in the book describes the destiny of its reader, so the words change from one person to the next.
That's all I ask. With your help, we have a chance to make a better life for ourselves here. For that, I thank you.
None know its origins, but the stories say that men who hear its music are compelled to dance uncontrollably, no matter the peril.
Then it's true, what everyone is saying? That Aventus Aretino is doing the Black Sacrament? Trying to summon the Dark Brotherhood?
All right. I won't deny it, child. What you heard is true. But Aventus Aretino walks a dark path. His actions can lead only to ruin.
You come here where you're not wanted, you eat our food, you pollute our city with your stink and you refuse to help the Stormcloaks.
You've seen how we live -- cramped alleys, run-down buildings, few guard patrols. Even the name [QUOTE]Gray Quarter[QUOTE] is an insult.
These tools were found in a crypt outside Windhelm. They belonged to the ancient Nords who dwelt in Skyrim before the days of the First Empire.
Some see only blank pages, and nobody knows why. Perhaps some of us are born with no destiny, or maybe the blank pages signify an imminent death.
(woof)
*gasp*
*cough*
Get her!
No! Noooooo!
There she is!
Damn it, not now!
Hey, what the...?
Gods, what a mess.
The boss went down there? Today?
But... Eisa? She's smarter than that.
What? There's a whole shift down there!
Yeah... Let's wait a little longer. Then...
Ra'jirr was always dragging her into things.
Yeah, he's after Ra'jirr- never seen him so angry.
Something's wrong... Boss' been down there too long.
But.. stealing the boss's sword? Did he have a death wish?
Who knows. The cat was crazy. She was a fool to trust him.
Now you're sounding as crazy as the cat. Be going on about the Pale Lady next.
I've got a bad feeling about this... something's just felt wrong down there lately. Eerie.
Kyr's orders. Nobody goes in or out until he gets back. Or the boss will skin you soon as he's done with Ra'jirr.
Again!
And begin.
Hmm? What is it?
Go, boys! Attack!
Look out! The prisoners are loose!
Ah, a test subject! Go, my pets! Attack!
Good. We'll take a short break, then move on to wide-area destruction spells.
Agggh!
Noo...
Uggh...
Unnff...
Aggghh...
I will return...
Ahhhh!
Silence!
Gaaaaah!!!
Noooooo!!!
Now get out!
groan of pain
Let's begin again.
Silence, prisoner!
And his name is...?
You know the rules.
Let's get out of here.
Yes? What do you need?
Please. Take your time.
SILENCE - do not record
Everyone talks, in the end.
I'm just doing my duty, sir.
So he has talked! I knew it!
That would probably be best.
What can I get for you, sir?
Never mind, I'm dead already-
Did you learn anything useful?
He's got to be here somewhere.
What can I get for you, ma'am?
I'll see you back in Riverwood.
Silence, traitor! Move. Slowly.
Start at the beginning, as usual.
Good luck. You're on your own now.
I have my own expenses you know...
No, no. I'll... I'll wait outside.
But, I need that money! I earned it.
Tss! Get out of here, I saw nothing.
Yes, yes. Now to find myself a drink.
Perhaps I should ask the Ambassador...
Surrender immediately or you both die.
There's an old man. He lives in Riften.
Everything's in order. Welcome back, sir.
He can't treat me like that. He needs me.
Ready to board the carriage to the embassy?
And where can we find this nameless old man?
Let's go, let's go! Before anyone notices us.
Not here. I told you to meet me in Riverwood.
You know the rules. Just answer the questions.
A guest, feeling ill. Leave the poor wretch be.
If you persist in this stubbornness I'll have...
Ah! A fellow latecomer to Elenwen's little soiree.
Perhaps we might share a carriage after the party?
So far so good. Let's hope nobody saw us slip out.
I knew he was telling the truth. I always can tell.
Don't mind me. I'm perfectly insensible to the cold.
Hurry it up. I've got to get back before I'm missed.
And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, sir!
As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open the door.
I don't know his name. Like I've told already a hundred-
I don't think you were followed. Come on. I have a plan.
Can I... I could help you. He'd talk to me. He trusts me.
muted moans of pain, groans -- someone who's been tortured
You'd like to come downstairs with me, is that it, Gissur?
Rulindil, pah! One day, the shoe will be on the other foot.
Come on. If someone misses me at the party, we're both dead.
No... for pity's sake... I've already told you everything...
Just stay close and let me do any talking, got it? Follow me.
And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, my good lady!
A guest? In the kitchens? You know this is against the rules...
There's not enough drinking in the world today, wouldn't you agree?
Listen up, spy! You're trapped in here, and we have your accomplice.
But no one else has brought you such valuable information, have they?
I've figured out how we're going to get you into the Thalmor Embassy.
We need to pass through the kitchen. Your gear is hidden in the larder.
Who comes, Malborn? You know I don't like strange smells in my kitchen.
You'll get the rest of your money when we confirm his story. As agreed.
You made it out alive, at least. Your gear's safe in my room, as promised.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be meeting Malborn in Solitude.
Rules, is it, Tsavani? I didn't realize that eating Moon Sugar was permitted.
Your gear is in that chest. I'll lock the door behind you. Don't screw this up.
I need to lock the door behind you or the patrols might notice something's wrong.
Stop. Please. I don't know anything else. Don't you think I'd have told you already?
Now, I have work to do. Leave me to it, if you ever want to see the rest of your payment.
They're scared of the dragons, too, aren't they? Paying too well. They don't know anything.
Esbern? He's alive? I thought the Thalmor must have got him years ago. That crazy old man...
I'll go after you. Although these fellows know me. I never miss one of Elenwen's parties, you see.
Silence. You know the rules. Do not speak unless spoken to. Master Rulindil will ask the questions.
Etienne, he's talked, hasn't he? He knows where that old man is you're looking for, he told me himself.
I prefer to arrive early. Often the day before the party. So as not to miss out on any of the drinking.
Hmm. I guess that will have to do. You should pass for a real guest, at least until you open your mouth.
No, wait! I was just... catching my breath... why wouldn't I tell you again? I don't even know anything...
Now then. Here's my invitation, I don't have a poisoned dagger strapped to my thigh, et cetera, et cetera.
Like I said, I don't know! I've seen him down in the Ratway. Maybe he lives down there, but I don't know for sure.
He could be this Esbern you're looking for, but I don't know. He's old and seemed kind of crazy. That's all I know.
Shall we loose his bonds and put you in a cell together? You can ask him anything you like, and see how he answers.
Do not presume, Gissur. You are most useful, but do not presume. We have other informants who are less... offensive.
Figures the Thalmor would be on his trail, though, if they were trying to find out what's going on with the dragons.
I will just... rest here a moment. Although it is damnably cold out here. I don't look forward to the trip back down...
Etienne must know something related to the dragons... who else might know? Greasy Thom... no, they'd see right through him...
My lateness is due more to getting lost on the way up this gods-forsaken mountain than to any desire to actually arrive late.
I know, I know - we've just met. But think, by the time the party is over we'll no doubt be fast friends. I look forward to it.
What else do you want from me? I've already told you everything. Listen, if you let me go I can take you to Riften, show you where-
That will be all for now. I must say I continue to be disappointed in your lack of cooperation. I hope next time you will do better.
Bored!
Yaaawwwwnn....
Oh, pardon me. Were you saying something? I do apologize, it's just that I find myself suddenly and irrevocably...
I mean, really. Here you stand, before Sheogorath himself, Daedric Prince of Madness, and all you deem fit to do is... deliver a message? How sad.
But...
Not now, Braith.
Mother? Can I talk to you?
Funny.
Grrah!
...You! Why?
Let's finish this.
No. I will have no peace until these hunters are dead.
Hello.
<Laughter>
Harpies, every one of them.
Oh, come now. Don't go away mad.
Oh, hi, I'm glad I ran into you. I was wondering if...
I don't know. If you see any big strong men around, let us know, will you?
Hello, ladies! Is there anything a big strong man can do for you this fine day?
I see.
Your choice.
Waste of time, then.
If that is your wish.
Very well. I am poorer for it.
Oh. I'm sorry I said anything, then.
What are you, some kind of tease? Stendarr's Mercy....
Idiot.
Already have.
It's better that way.
Wasn't your business, anyway.
Is it?
Lok...
Vah...
Koor...
Dragonborn... wait.
The Word calls you. Go to it.
I have spoken. The Rotmulaag waits.
By long tradition, the elder speaks first.
Why do you delay? Are you Dovahkiin or not?
Why do you intrude here, if not for tinvaak?
A gift, Dovahkiin. Shul. Understand Sun as the dov do.
A gift, Dovahkiin. Yol. Understand Fire as the dov do.
Clear Skies will blow away the mist, but only for a time.
A gift, Dovahkiin. Toor. Understand Inferno as the dov do.
Do not be afraid. Faasnu. Let me feel the power of your Thu'um.
Follow me. I will show you how to open the path to Paarthurnax.
Our hadrimme, our minds cannot even... comprehend its concepts.
Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as elf, but as dovah!
Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as orc, but as dovah!
Come, Dovahkiin. Nin Yol. Strike me with the fire of your Thu'um.
Trust your instincts, Dovahkiin. Your blood will show you the way.
Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as mortal, but as dovah!
The Dragonrend Shout is evil. Would you cure one evil with another?
Arngeir. Rek los Dovahkiin, Strundu'ul. Rek fen tinvaak Paarthurnax.
Arngeir. Rok los Dovahkiin, Strundu'ul. Rok fen tinvaak Paarthurnax.
Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as khajiit, but as dovah!
Now, show me what you can do. Greet me not as Argonian, but as dovah!
The path to Paarthurnax is perilous, not to be embarked upon lightly.
Hear my Thu'um! Feel it in your bones. Match it, if you are Dovahkiin!
Keep moving, stay focused on your goal, and you will reach the summit.
Paarthurnax is the only one who can answer your questions about Dragonrend.
Tell me. Why do you come here, volaan? Why do you intrude on my meditation?
In order to learn and use this Shout, you will be taking this evil into yourself.
The path to Paarthurnax lies through this gate. I will show you how to open the way.
Your kind - joorre - mortals - created it as a weapon against the dov... the dragons.
When you learn a Shout, you take it into your very being. In a sense, you become the Shout.
It was created by those who had lived under the unimaginable cruelty of Alduin's Dragon Cult.
I will grant you my understanding of Clear Skies. This is your final gift from us, Dragonborn. Use it well.
Their whole lives were consumed with hatred for dragons, and they poured all their anger and hatred into this Shout.
They carried out a genocide of dragons when they first came to Tamriel, and now they will do it again, with your help.
The Blades! Of course. They specialize in meddling in matters they barely understand. Their reckless arrogance knows no bounds.
The Blades were born of dragon-hating crusaders. They still carry that legacy although they may not remember from whence it came.
Aaah... yes! Sossedov los mul. The dragonblood runs strong in you. It is long since I had the pleasure of speech with one of my own kind.
Never!
Right.
Sir...
Enough! Stop!
Cease fighting. It's over.
It's over. No more violence.
We surrender. The capital is yours. If you pledge no harm will come of my people, I turn over the seat of power to you.
Sleep.
Yeeaahh! There.
One more... pull...
Can you get it open?
Which one was the rat?
Do it, Listener. Kill me.
I think so. Just hold on a moment.
Dunno. One of these corpses. Does it matter?
Damn it, there's got to be a way out of here!
Hurry, Nazir! I'm telling you, he's in there!
Hurry, Nazir! I'm telling you, she's in there!
Listener. I am your only salvation. Come. Embrace me.
Please, Listener. Release my soul, and let Sithis be the judge.
Anyway, I can smell the smoke. They've already set the place alight.
You must speak with Astrid. Here, in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary.
And so ends the Dark Brotherhood, once and for all. About bloody time.
You have no choice. You must complete your contract. You must kill me.
I'm not exactly built for manual labor. Now come on, you've almost got it.
Astrid is dead. It is as it should be. May she find redemption in the Void.
You assist all you like. And get roasted for your trouble. I'll guard the exit.
If I am to die today, so be it. But you'll not soon forget the Dark Brotherhood.
Arcturus took some men deeper in, wanted to be sure. We should maybe... assist them.
I'm going... as fast... as I can, you stupid she-devil. I don't see you... helping...
What's the bloody hold up in there? How long can it take to run through a few scraggly assassins?
But first, inform Nazir of your plans. For you are the Listener, and must bind this Family together.
Speak with Amaund Motierre at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. He will know the true Emperor's location.
But while you live, the Dark Brotherhood lives. We must fulfill our contract. Emperor Titus Mede II must be eliminated.
If they were easy to kill, don't you think we would have done it years ago? If our men aren't out in a few minutes, they're dead, trust me.
Suppose not. But what's taking the others so long? The sooner we get out of here, the better. Smoke's getting bad. This place'll be raging soon.
Smart.
Speak.
Of course, sir.
As you say, my Jarl.
Sir, we really must talk.
You've got sixty seconds. Go.
Balgruuf, my Jarl. A word, if I may.
I need but a moment of your time, my lord.
Hmm... All right, yes, I see your point. Make the necessary arrangements.
Yes, yes. Take care of it, Proventus. Whatever it is you're talking about...
Proventus, you're my steward. Your job is to offer me counsel. This? This is not counsel.
One of the servants had a wonderful idea. Fireproofing Dragonsreach. In case of attack by, um... air.
Damn it, Proventus. I've got war lurking just outside my gates, and this is what you offer me? This? Begone.
There's been talk again in the streets. A general fear that the giants may move south, and then... Well, you understand.
I think the time might be right for another public appearance. Maybe address the patrons at the Bannered Mare? Or visit Jorrvaskr?
We really must discuss the security here in Dragonsreach. Perhaps we could limit patrols in the city, and retain more guards here?
My daughter Adrianne wants to forge a new sword for you. Now, it wouldn't be a Skyforge blade, I know, but she really is quite gifted...
Well... It's your son. Nelkir. The boy has been acting increasingly peculiar. Moreso than normal, I mean. Something really should be done...
Truly?
Ha! By Shor, this city could use more like you.
Best head up to Dragonsreach, then, and see the Jarl. He's lord of Whiterun, and can set you on the path.
Where?
Oh? Where?
Where are you thinking?
And where would that be?
You want to move? Where?
Oh really? And where were you thinking?
I was just getting settled in. Where are we going?
Wrong!
Actually, you do. Sort of.
Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. At your service.
I am a part of you, little mortal. I am a shadow in your subconscious, a blemish on your fragile little psyche. You know me. You just don't know it.
(Gasps)
Go away!
Hear me!
Elisif...
Come back here!
Go. Away. Please!
Protect the Jarl!
Please, just go away!
Leave - me - a - lone!
She is here, among us.
Our Lord! She has come!
Prove yourselves to me!
Failure is not an option.
Stay where I can see you.
I'm not taking any visitors.
Do this, and I shall favor you.
Well, what are you waiting for?!
You need an escort at all times.
Shhh! Be still. Beware her anger!
Damn it, I lost her! Protect the Jarl!
Damn it, I lost him!  Protect the Jarl!
(Sounds of unlocking and unbarring a door)
But which among you truly exceeds the rest?
Come in, come in! Shut the door behind you!
Go to Solitude. Stalk the Jarl and slay her.
I thought you didn't believe I was in danger!
Remember always this: As you will it, so it shall be.
You have earned the right to call yourself my Champion.
I have a special task for whichever of you is left standing.
I shall write your name upon the Tablet of Absolute Darkness.
I've brought a friend. Someone who can help. A bodyguard. To protect you.
I have need of a warrior. Only the most ruthless, cunning, and agile will do.
Well, well. You've slain my followers. I should destroy you for your impudence!
But my purpose was ultimately gained. My previous champion was erased, and a new one born.
On the other hand, you've weeded out the weak from among those who would deign worship me.
If you can learn to be subtle in rendering death, perhaps I will share more of my power with you.
I desired stealth and secrecy, but you executed the task with as much subtlety as a enrage mammoth.
You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat few manage and live to tell about.
You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat few manage and live to tell about it.
And now you must perform the task for which I created you. You have already proven to possess the needed skills.
You have gathered here night after night, sacrificing fools upon my shrine, and sparring aimlessly with yourselves.
Now go. I have strings to pull that require my full attention. You may pursue your own course wherever it leads you.
Remember always this: You need answer to no authority, neither mortal, nor divine... As you will it, so it shall be.
You may keep my Ebony Mail, a token of my appreciation to my new champion. Its gifts will resonate with your talents.
I have spread rumors of an assassin. It will make your job harder, but will allow me to place blame where I desire it.
Succeed, and you may keep your title and my armor, and I shall write your name upon the Tablet of Absolute Blackness.
Bolgeir's loyal, but even he doesn't do what I ask. Case in point, this whole assassin thing. Well at least I have you now.
I'm glad they finally believed me. About the assassin I mean. It's been so hard since my Torygg passed. No one takes me seriously.
It doesn't really matter what I believe, now does it? I've brought you someone who can protect you. That's what you want, isn't it?
Look at me ramble... Well, I guess I'll go about my business sulking in here. You can stand over there in the corner watching for assassins.
So how's this work exactly? Do you just kind of stand there on the look out? That's what Bolgeir does. Well, he sort of looms more than stands.
You will need stealth and lies to get past her guards. You will assassinate her swiftly and quietly. And if combat finds you, survive the escape.
You could be the one I seek... if your will is strong, lure a thrall to my shrine. Convince him to embrace the Pillar of Sacrifice. Then slay him.
(growl)
You go on ahead.
As you wish, my Thane.
Certainly. Be careful.
All right. Don't be long.
I'll keep watch from here.
Very well. Just be careful!
Go on ahead. I'll stand guard.
All right. Don't take too long.
You sure? Fine. I'll stand watch.
I'll be right here. Be careful now!
Head on, then. I'll keep an eye out.
As you wish. Just don't forget about me.
You sure? All right. I'll keep guard here.
Here? Right here? Very well, J'zargo shall wait.
Patience isn't exactly my strong suit, but alright.
Don't make me wait too long. I get bored very easily.
I'll wait here. Just don't start any trouble without me.
I'll stay here. You try not to get into too much trouble.
(whine)
I'm heading home if you need me.
I'll head back home if you need me.
Then back home is where you'll find me.
You need my strength again, I'll be home.
I'll be heading home, then, if you need me.
I will be back at your house if you need me, Thane.
Well, it's been fun. I guess I'll head back to Rorikstead.
You'll be all right on your own? Then I'll see you back at the College.
Really? J'zargo was having such fun. Ah, well. Back to the College then.
So you think you can make it on your own, then? We'll just see about that.
If that's what you want. Come find me at the College if you change your mind.
Farewell, then. If you need my services again, just come and look for me in the usual place.
If that's what you want. Watch your back out there, and if you need me again, you know where I'll be.
I understand. We must all follow our own paths. If you wish to find me again, I'll be in Nightcaller Temple.
Such a shame. I thought we were getting along so well. I'll head back to Riften if you should have second thoughts.
You're letting me go? What's wrong, is my skill with a blade making you look bad? Hah! I'm kidding, friend. Until we meet again!
It is a lonely thing, facing all the dangers of Skyrim by yourself. Come and find me if you decide that you miss my companionship.
(woof!)
Show me.
That it?
(panting)
Following.
Can't do it.
I will wait.
Is that all?
Not possible.
Okay, got it.
Lead on, then.
Yes, my Thane?
I'll wait here.
It will be done.
Lead on, friend.
That everything?
We follow, then.
It shall be done.
No. Not possible.
Oh yes, Listener!
All set, let's go.
Lead. I'll follow.
Let's tread softly.
That can't be done.
Khajiit will follow.
Can't do that. Sorry.
Then that is my task.
Let's get going, then.
Mara will protect you.
May the Hist guide us.
Of course. Right away.
You lead, I'll follow.
We'll be waiting, then.
Command me, my Listener.
I'll just be here, then.
I'll be right here, then.
Lead us to our next task.
Do you need anything else?
I'm ready, let's continue.
If only I could, Listener.
As you say, it will happen.
Malacath witness our deeds.
No problem, I'll handle it.
With pleasure, my Listener!
Anything else before you go?
Anything you need, Listener.
Not for you. Not for anyone.
I'm sorry, that can't be done.
Nothing else? I'm always eager.
I won't do it. You ask too much.
Back to the great task of waiting.
Sorry, Listener. It can't be done.
Even Khajiit have their limits. No.
Go where the challenge is greatest.
Forget it. I don't do that kind of work.
Maybe you want to rethink what you're asking?
Oh Listener. Can't you see that's impossible?
I will not drag my honor through the mud for you, or anyone.
But Listener... Are you sure? I just can't bring myself to do it...
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do something like that. Even for you.
Now wait a minute, Listener. Even Cicero has his limits! Not many, mind you... but I do have them...
A what?
Don't you go pulling my leg. Give it here.
Ah yes.
Well? Out with it.
I suppose it's time I gave him an answer...
Did he now? The man is persistent, I'll give him that.
We can talk about that once this dragon is dealt with.
Ah yes. I've studied those documents... Very interesting...
No doubt requesting to garrison his men in my castle. How many times must I deny him?
Always.
How goes the hunt?
What glorious prey. Come back alive, and with stories to tell!
Skjor's heard rumors of a bear the size of a mammoth in Hammerfell. We're going to seek it out.
Bormah!
Gauldur!
By you?
What then?
They should be so lucky.
That they might get themselves killed.
All these younglings scampering around.
Worried one of them is going to take your place?
Some of them might try. But that's not what I'm worried about.
Coward.
Do you?
But what you seek does not come easily, and can destroy those without a strong will.
It is true there are some here who have spent years studying the accumulated knowledge of the scrolls.
Dragon?
Enough!
I just...
Yes, my Jarl.
We should not...
Who's this, then?
That would be best.
By Ysmir, Irileth was right!
My lord. Please. You have to listen.
You'd better speak to the Jarl, then.
What would you have me do, then? Nothing?
If you'll excuse me, I'll return to my duties.
Irileth, send a detachment to Riverwood at once.
My lord, we should send troops to Riverwood at once.
It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what he has to say.
It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what she has to say.
If the news from Helgen is true... well, there's no telling what it means.
I only counsel caution. We cannot afford to act rashly in times like these.
I'll not stand idly by while a dragon burns my hold and slaughters my people!
It's in the most immediate danger, if that dragon is lurking in the mountains...
Oh, yes? We'll get to that, after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation.
My lord. Please. This is no time for rash action. I just think we need more information before we act.
What do you say now, Proventus? Shall we continue to trust in the strength of our walls? Against a dragon?
The Jarl of Falkreath will view that as a provocation! He'll assume we're preparing to join Ulfric's side and attack him.
Farkas!
And their arm.
Did you call me?
Leave that to me.
Of course we did, icebrain.
What matters is their heart.
They challenge us to be our best.
Good luck. Welcome to the Companions.
But I still hear the call of the blood.
Don't let Vilkas catch you saying that.
I hope we keep you. This can be a rough life.
Come to me or Aela if you're looking for work.
Ah, yes. I heard you gave him quite a thrashing.
Tilma will keep the place clean. She always has.
New blood? Oh, hello. I'm Farkas. Come, follow me.
New blood? Oh, I remember you. Come on, follow me.
Master, you're not truly considering accepting her?
Master, you're not truly considering accepting him?
I told you, this is the whelp that Vilkas mentioned.
Show this new blood where the rest of the whelps sleep.
Vilkas, take him out to the yard and see what he can do.
Vilkas, take her out to the yard and see what she can do.
We all do. It is our burden to bear. But we can overcome.
Skjor and Aela like to tease me, but they are good people.
Nice to have a new face around. It gets boring here sometimes.
You know this one? I saw her training in the yard with Vilkas.
You know this one? I saw him training in the yard with Vilkas.
All right, so here you are. Looks like the others are eager to meet you.
The quarters are up here. Just pick a bed and fall in it when you're tired.
Apologies. But perhaps this isn't the time. I've never even heard of this outsider.
Once you've made a bit of a name for yourself, Skjor and Vilkas might have things for you to do.
You have my brother and I, obviously. But I don't know if the rest will go along quite so easily.
Sometimes the famous come to us. Sometimes men and women come to us to seek their fame. It makes no difference.
I am nobody's master, Vilkas. And last I checked, we had some empty beds in Jorrvaskr for those with a fire burning in their hearts.
Father!
Please, lead on.
Dibella, guide us.
Lead us to your Sybil.
Fjotra, dear. Did they hurt you?
It's our honor to have you there.
Of course not. My spirit remains strong.
This man is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?
This woman is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?
My little girl. Always strong. Do you know where you have to go?
Now, come with me, child. We'll prepare you for the goddess's presence.
I'm to go to the temple in Markarth. I... I'll have to leave you and mother.
Fjotra!
Gallus!
Goodbye, Karliah.
Will I ever see you again?
What will you do now, my love?
Farewell, Gallus. Eyes open... walk with the shadows.
Nocturnal calls me to the Evergloam. My contract has been fulfilled.
When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid, we'll embrace once again.
I feared I would never see you again. I was afraid you'd become like the others.
If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would have come true. He honors us all.
If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would have come true. She honors us all.
Gerdur!
Gerdur...
The cowards!
Hod. Just come here.
Make yourself at home.
Mind your mother, boy!
You're right. Follow me.
I guess you get used to it.
Did you really see a dragon?
Are you hurt? What's happened?
I'm glad to help any way I can.
You don't mean, a real, live...
Let me worry about the Imperials.
Helgen? Has something happened...?
Gerdur, I'm fine. At least now I am.
And who's this? One of your comrades?
I can't remember when I last slept...
Good luck, brother. I'll see you later.
I told you my sister would help us out.
I hope to see you in Windhelm. Good luck.
Any friend of Ralof's is a friend of mine.
Brother! Mara's mercy, it's good to see you!
Don't worry about me. I know how to lay low.
Hmph. Help them drink up our mead, you mean.
I bet my uncle Ralof is tougher than you are.
Thanks, sister. I knew we could count on you.
Hush, Frodnar. This is no time for your games.
What is it, woman? Sven drunk on the job again?
Are we really the first to make it to Riverwood?
I can hardly believe it myself, and I was there.
But then... out of nowhere... a dragon attacked...
Aw, mama, I want to stay and talk with Uncle Ralof!
I almost can't believe it... a real, live dragon...
There he goes. Looks like he's gone for good this time.
Hod! Come here a minute. I need your help with something.
Ralof! What are you doing here? Ah... I'll be right down.
Not a comrade yet, but a friend. I owe her my life, in fact.
Not a comrade yet, but a friend. I owe him my life, in fact.
Warrior, good! Those stars will guide you to honor and glory.
Come on. I'll feel better once we're under cover in Riverwood.
Now, Ralof, what's going on? You two look pretty well done in.
When your friend told me, I didn't believe it at first either.
Do you think that dragon is still flying around here somewhere?
Nobody else has come up the south road today, as far as I know.
I'm glad you decided to come with me. We're almost to Riverwood.
Good luck. Come to Windhelm and talk to Ulfric. You won't regret it.
If we run into any Imperials, just let me do the talking, all right?
Like they knew exactly where we'd be. That was... two days ago, now.
Brother! Mara's mercy, you're safe! Your friend told me about Helgen...
sharp intake of breath -- surprise and amazement -- [QUOTE]wha??[QUOTE]
I'm going to rest up here a while before heading to Windhelm. Be careful.
But is it safe for you to be here? Won't the Imperials be looking for you?
But is it safe for you to be here? We heard that Ulfric had been captured...
I'll let them into the house and, you know, show them where everything is...
Nonsense. You and your friend are welcome to stay here as long as you need to.
Never said that. Just that we don't get many of you wanting to join, that's all.
Go and watch the south road. Come find us if you see any Imperial soldiers coming.
That's right! Don't worry, Uncle Ralof, I won't let those soldiers sneak up on you.
Good. Maybe we can lay up for a while. I hate to put your family in danger, Gerdur, but...
I ought to get back to work before I'm missed, but... did anyone else escape? Did Ulfric...
Look at you, almost a grown man! Won't be long before you'll be joining the fight yourself.
My sister Gerdur runs the mill in Riverwood, just up the road. I'm sure she'd help you out.
Don't worry. I'm sure he made it out. It'll take more than a dragon to stop Ulfric Stormcloak.
We'd better keep moving. I don't want to run into any Imperials who know what happened at Helgen.
As strange as it sounds, we'd be dead if not for that dragon. In the confusion, we managed to slip away.
Is there somewhere we can talk? There's no telling when the news from Helgen will reach the Imperials...
Looks like nobody here knows what's happened yet. Come on. Gerdur's probably working in her lumber mill.
Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
Uncle Ralof! Can I see your axe? How many Imperials have you killed? Do you really know Ulfric Stormcloak?
You sure you won't change your mind? Riverwood isn't far. I'm sure my sister will be glad to help you out.
If you really are Ralof's friend, I'll be glad to help you. But you didn't answer my question - how do you know him?
Where to start? Well, the news you heard about Ulfric was true. The Imperials ambushed us outside Darkwater Crossing.
You know, you should go to Windhelm and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today.
See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. I never understood how my sister could stand living in the shadow of that place.
They wouldn't dare give Ulfric a fair trial. Treason, for fighting for your own people! All of Skyrim would have seen the truth then.
We stopped in Helgen this morning, and I thought it was all over. Had us lined up to the headsman's block and ready to start chopping.
Remember, this isn't Stormcloak territory. If we're ahead of the news from Helgen we should be fine as long as we don't do anything stupid.
No way to know if anyone else made it out alive. But this place is going to be swarming with Imperials soon enough. We'd better clear out of here.
Good...
Hahaha!
<Giggling>
You can't catch me!
Harlot.
You think a few miles can truly keep us apart?
So have you spoken to that man from the Bards College?
No, not yet. But I will. I just haven't... gotten around to it yet.
Tsk. You've uncovered my master plan. Now I suppose you'll never leave.
Oh Jon, stop dallying. You know you have to go. It's why Mara put you on this earth.
You mean you won't forget about me the moment I'm out of sight? Get yourself a nice old rich husband, have sixteen babies?
Hm hmm.
Saffir!
Uh huh.
Hmm hmm.
See you.
We done?
Stay sharp.
Ride strong.
Right, then.
Do come back.
Good hunting.
Goodbye, sir.
I'll see you.
Wait... I....
Farewell, sir.
Goodbye, dear.
Goodbye, ma'am.
Sure. Whatever.
Yeah, whatever.
And you're sure?
Speak your mind.
Yeah, take care.
Back to my book...
Farewell, my lady.
Nnnnooowwwwwww....
Well met, kinsman.
Yes, yes. Goodbye.
Well met, traveler.
What can I get you?
Stay out of trouble.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
I ain't done nothin'.
Keep your distance...
Keep your nose clean.
Long live the Empire.
Live long. Fight well.
Right. Till next time.
So what can I get you?
Take care of yourself.
You have my attention.
Good. Chat time's over.
I've got my eyes on you.
It's back to work, then.
Thanks for the business.
Hello, child of Kynareth.
I ain't much for talkin'.
What is it that you need?
Damn it, I lost my page...
I was done talkin' anyway.
I've said too much already.
Good doin' business with ya.
I... I don't have any money.
I've really got to be going.
May Talos guide you. Always.
Shhh. You'll scare the deer.
What? Why you lookin' at me?
Why you still starin' at me?
Yeah, take care of yourself.
You go on your way now, boy.
Come to gawk at the dark elf?
Got of lot of steel to shape.
You go on your way now, girl.
You watch yourself out there.
Grace of Kynareth be with you.
Next time, deal with Avenicci.
Now please, no more questions.
Right, I really am busy. So...
It pleases me to see you again.
Oho! And what do you want, hmm?
You take care of yourself, now.
Battle-Born! Give me your money!
I have several elixirs for sale.
I just want to go home and read.
I'm commander of the guard, now.
Enjoy your visit to Dragonsreach.
If you need a drink, just holler.
Excuse me, but I'm trying to read.
I serve Jarl Baalgruuf as steward.
The blessing of Arkay be upon you.
Spare a coin for a poor old beggar?
Finally. I got stuff to do, ya know.
You should be talking to my Steward.
Hungry, tired, or just plain thirsty?
I think I hear my daughter calling...
Need anything else, just let me know.
Stay vigilant! Our enemies are legion!
Thank you very much for your business.
The finest cuts, fresh from the wilds!
We've got arms and armor of all kinds.
Come back anytime if you need a remedy.
Like to see him laugh his way out that.
Gal like you needs a warhorse, I reckon.
It's the leaving that's hardest, I know.
Man like you needs a warhorse, I reckon.
May all your possible futures be bright.
A few septims for my supper is all I ask.
Got the fleetest steeds in all o' Skyrim.
Need a horse? Talk to my father, Skulvar.
Ripe fruit and fresh vegetables for sale!
Some parting advice - women love sonnets.
I think I've got some mugs need scrubbin'.
If you need any jewelry, just let me know.
My boys'll keep you safe. Don't you worry.
What? Speak your meaning plainly, old man.
Take pity, sir, and spare me a few septims.
You should try the venison. It's delicious.
I ain't askin' for much, just a few septims.
I assure you, I'm prepared to make any deal.
Take pity, lady, and spare me a few septims.
Think very carefully about your next move...
You tried mercenary work? It might suit you.
Fresh-baked loaves, still warm from the oven!
If there's nothing else, I have work to do...
Make a move toward Balgruuf, and you're dead.
Need something? Talk to my brother, Elrindir.
Fear not. Come dragon or giant, we'll be ready.
I just can't fill an order that size on my own.
If you need more food or drink, speak to Hulda.
Now if you don't mind, I've got a city to keep.
I work for Belethor, at the general goods store.
I'm a bard by trade. Perhaps you've heard of me?
I'm the commander of the guard here in Whiterun.
Look at you! Betcha think you're something, huh?
Remember, your mind is the best weapon you have.
Ha! I'd sooner bend my knee to Ulfric Stormcloak.
I'm the Jarl, not a barkeep. Speak your business.
It's no fun getting pushed around all the time...
May your sword be sharp, and your tongue sharper.
I help my father in more ways than people realize.
Please, leave me to recover my... mental energies.
One more song, what say you? Yeah? All right, then!
Travel great Skyrim, and Kynareth travels with you.
If you'll excuse me, I really just want to get home.
Keep a song in your heart, and a blade in your boot.
Keep your eyes open for those Stormcloak dogs, yeah?
Walk always in the light, in these days of darkness.
If you run into any Stormcloaks, kill a dozen for me.
Thank you, thank you. No, please, hold your applause.
This war's as stupid as our feud with Clan Gray-Mane.
Welcome to Belethor's General Goods. Welcome, indeed.
I see everything, hear everything and know everything.
Remember, I'll give you the best deals, or die trying.
Hello, friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?
If you need potions, you should try Arcadia's Cauldron.
Remember, fresh fruit and vegetables every day. Mostly.
You have come! You have come to hear the word of Talos!
Need a blade? You should talk to Adrianne, at the forge.
Remember, I've got the freshest meat in all of Whiterun.
Thank you, good patrons of the Bannered Mare! Thank you!
The Stormcloaks are living on borrowed time, believe me.
We can never rest easy, for Balgruuf's enemies will not.
We'll have to have a pint together sometime, you and me.
You're lookin' at a real warrior! At least I used to be.
Besides, Gray-Mane would never make steel for the Legion.
Boys, girls, dogs, elders - there's nobody I won't fight!
Don't you go trackin' your dirty boots on my clean floor!
Is it cold in here? I should put more wood on the fire...
Oh! You startled me. I wasn't expecting company out here.
Please keep your weapons sheathed in the Jarl's presence.
Don't let the door slam into your backside on the way out.
Don't mean to be rude, but I'm too busy to talk right now.
I sell cures for all ills, and I'll be happy to serve you.
I've dispatched a rider to Helgen. We'll know soon enough.
If there's any more I can help you with, just let me know.
Keep walkin', softgut. I'm more woman than you can handle.
So I mostly sweep and shovel. You got a problem with that?
Don't forget to check inside the shop if you need anything.
Lookin' to shatter records or bones? My beasts can do both.
Oh, I'm a good keeper of secrets. Have to be, in this hall.
The Legion will regain control of this city. Mark my words.
Do you hunt? The plains outside Whiterun are ripe with game.
If it's work you're looking for, Hulda's the one to talk to.
You look tired, friend. The Bannered Mare has beds for rent.
Best if... you didn't mention to anyone that you saw me here.
Do be careful, child. Skyrim is not as safe as it used to be.
Do forget to see me at my shop sometime - Arcadia's Cauldron.
Have you met my father? He's the steward, up at Dragonsreach.
If there's anything I can help you with, you have but to ask.
Nothing like a good adventure or romance to lose yourself in.
You always keep us in mind when you need a fresh horse, yeah?
Father says I ain't smart enough to be stablemaster. Some day.
I got no quarrel with you, but I won't turn one down, neither.
I just need to hire one, maybe two good men. You won't starve.
Now if ya don't mind, my house could do with a bit of dusting.
Please, do look around. I'm sure I have something you'll want.
The security in Whiterun is terrible. Shameful, is what it is.
My poor Fralia thinks Thorald's still alive, but I know better.
We sell bows, arrows and ale. A unique combination, to be sure.
You just let me know what you need. I am at your beck and call.
Have it your way. I'll take the job, but don't expect a miracle.
How many Nords died to save the Empire? And what was our reward?
I don't fight Lars no more, if that's what you're worried about.
I'll be happy to assist you if you'd like to purchase something.
Maybe we'll meet in the field. Just pray we're on the same side.
Ah, hello my Nord friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?
If it's armor you need, we've got all kinds, both light and heavy.
Need something? Unlike the rest of my family, I've got work to do.
By Sithis, but you are a persistent one. Haven't I told you enough?
Come to chat with an old woman, hmm? Do your good deed for the day?
I'm... Well, who I am isn't important. Let's leave it at that, hmm?
If my cleanin' gets in your way, just say the word an' I'll be off.
Mind your manners and pay your bills, and you'll always be welcome.
Mind yourself in front of the Jarl, or we'll have serious problems.
The daughters of this land are just as strong and loyal as its men.
Whiterun belongs to the true sons of Skyrim now, just as it should.
Crush, clobber, slash or slice. We've got a weapon for any occasion.
If there's nothing else, I really do have important matters tend to.
My boy Lars has been getting beat senseless, and by a girl, no less!
There's a nip in the air. Cold won't be good for my crops. Never is.
What's the matter? You can't stand the sight of a strong Nord woman?
With this terrible war, I'm a bit overwhelmed. As are the catacombs.
Ah, hello my Khajiit friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?
Careful, huh? Thanks, Skulvar. I'll remember that. Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Got some good pieces out here, if you're looking to buy. More inside.
The Jarl is, as you can imagine, very busy. Perhaps I can assist you?
You should talk to the Jarl up in Dragonsreach, lend any aid you can.
After Whiterun is retaken, Ulfric will pay in blood for his insolence.
Ah, hello my Argonian friend. In the market for some hunting supplies?
Everything's for sale, my friend! You need visit no other shops today!
Panic we can handle, Balgruuf. It's the dragons I'm not so sure about.
I know your family's honor is important to you, but we can't afford it!
Bits and baubles for sale, all crafted by the best blacksmith in Skyrim.
I hope you're looking at me like that because you want to buy something?
Quickly now, or would you prefer I let Whiterun fall to the Stormcloaks?
That Heimskr's crazy. Him and his talk o' Talos. Wish he'd just shut up.
The people saw fit to name me Jarl, and I don't intend to let them down.
When the Empire surrendered to the Aldmeri Dominion, they shamed us all!
Everything you see here was made with skill and care by my wife Adrianne.
I don't get much time time off from the tavern, but I enjoy it when I do.
If you have need of hunting supplies then you've come to the right place.
Next time, come see my at my shop. I've got some things you'll just love.
The Stormcloaks can keep this city safe better than those Legion lapdogs.
Can you believe those pathetic Gray-Manes still show their face in public?
Hagraven or horker, it matters not. We've got the arrows to fell any game.
They say there's nothing a Nord woman can't do if she puts her mind to it.
I don't know what you did, but Braith won't even look at me now! So thanks!
Looking to do some hunting? Avoid Brittleshin Pass. It's southeast of here.
Old lady Maiden-Loom owns the stables. But my father and me, we run things.
We've got small weapons as well as big. Maces, daggers, that sort of thing.
Goodbye. And if you happen to see Mikael, tell him I was asking about him...
I mean no offense. I am but a humble farmer, not a great wanderer, like you.
Olfrid, patron of the great Clan Battle-Born, a name I'm sure you know well.
Be warned, the Jarl is in a foul mood since the Stormcloaks overran Whiterun.
I've been tending to the warriors of Jorrvaskr for as long as I can remember.
Shop at Belethor's for the best prices and selection. He pays me to say that.
Vignar and I have our hands full. It's no small task, running an entire hold.
You might be a guest in Dragonsreach, but you're starting to try my patience.
You should stop by my farm if you get a chance. See what life's really about.
Back to work, I guess. There's never a shortage of dung to shovel around here.
Come by Belethor's shop, at the market. I'm sure we've got something you need.
For thirty years, I served the Legion as a commander. Fought in the Great War.
Pardon me, but do I detect a case of the Rattles? I've got something for that.
You can't kick me out of here. You want me gone, you're gonna have to kill me.
You know what's wrong with Skyrim these days? Everyone is obsessed with death.
You need to be careful in this city. Never know who you can trust, these days.
I'd be dead if not for Vignar. He took me in and helped me turn my life around.
If you run into my husband Nazeem, remind him that he's not married to himself.
Come to Olava for a reading, did you? Sorry, pup, but I'm not quite in the mood.
Don't lecture me about treachery, whelp. You don't know the meaning of the word.
Remember - don't trust the Imperials. No matter what honeyed lies they tell you.
The guards in this city are all lazy and undisciplined. Things need to change...
There was love between our families. For generations. Now, there is only enmity.
You sound like my ma. Figured I was lying dead in a field somewhere, is that it?
You won't be laughing when the Thalmor come to root out Stormcloak sympathizers.
You'd better give me five septims right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose...
Did you know there are some fruits that actually grow better in the cold weather?
I can't fight. Not even a little bit. My family thinks I'm a little milk drinker.
I enjoy steady patronage in the Bannered Mare. I do hope you'll watch me perform.
What're you lookin' at? I'm not afraid of you, ya know. Even if you are my elder.
You should buy some produce from Carlotta's stall. Most of it comes from my farm.
Cause trouble in Whiterun, and I'll haul you into the Dragonsreach dungeon myself.
Oh, I'm just a servant, dear. You want to talk to one of the Companions, I'm sure.
Stormcloaks, Imperials, dragons. Ain't no matter to me what I kill. Let them come.
Welcome to Warmaiden's. Now you, my girl, have definitely come to the right place.
Whiterun once again belongs to its rightful heirs. It's a glorious day for Skyrim.
You look rather pale. Could be Ataxia. It's quite a problem back home in Cyrodiil.
Chops and steaks fit for a jarl! Come and see my selection of finest-quality meats!
Chops and steaks fit for a Jarl! Come and see my selection of finest-quality meats!
I can tell you're a discriminating customer. Perhaps you're a wealthy one, too, hm?
Looking for a horse? I own these stables, but Skulvar can help you with a purchase.
Need supplies? See Belethor at his store. Sleazy little man, but he has good stock.
Only thing better than ridin' a swift horse is ridin' a swift horse over the enemy.
So you're willing to starve your wife and daughter to reclaim some rusty old sword?
Ten septims tomorrow, baby Battle-Born. Or I'm gonna bloody your nose and your lip.
When the Stormcloaks took control of Whiterun, it was a victory for all true Nords.
I can tell you're no stranger to the wilds. I'm sure we can meet your hunting needs.
I hope the Empire is sending reinforcements to drive these heathens out of Whiterun.
One day the war will end and the true heirs of Skyrim will inherit this great realm.
We'll pay whatever it takes. But we must have more swords for the Imperial soldiers.
I'll get back to the Bannered Mare soon enough. Just need to stretch my legs a bit...
My Eorlund is the finest blacksmith in Skyrim, and that's not just a wife's boasting.
You wouldn't know it now, but the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns were once fast friends.
Ain't nobody high and mighty in these halls, exceptin' the Jarl. And don't you forget!
All this standing around is rubbish. We should be taking the fight to the Stormcloaks.
Evgir Unslaad has come at last. The [QUOTE]Season Unending.[QUOTE] War... without end.
Have you met my father? He was the steward, up at Dragonsreach when Balgruuf was Jarl.
I'll always be a commander, even if those Stormcloak dogs have stripped away my power.
It seems our enemies have no end of spies, saboteurs and assassins to send against us.
Never much cared for that Balgruuf myself. He was in the Empire's pocket, so to speak.
Shiny trinkets for your good lady! All crafted by the great Eorlund Gray-Mane himself!
Why don't you swallow that stubborn pride of yours and ask Eorlund Gray-Mane for help?
You are a welcome guest, but you must still respect the rules of the Jarl's household.
You're in my home. That's right. This here place, Breezehome, it belongs to old Terek.
I'm just out and about, love. The Bannered Mare can do without me for a bit, I suspect.
Do you get to the Cloud District very often? Oh, what am I saying - of course you don't.
I import books  whenever I can. Most Nord works are too bawdy and violent for my tastes.
I work with my mother, to sell fruits and vegetables. It's fun most days, but hard work.
I'm not a man, I'm a weapon in human form. Just unsheathe me, and point me at the enemy.
You know, if you've got the aptitude, you should join the Mages College in Winterhold...
I can't stand those braggart Battle-Borns. They think they're the gods' gift to Whiterun.
Praise Talos and all the Divines! Whiterun has been liberated by the true sons of Skyrim!
By Ysmir, this is just what we need. There'll be panic in the streets if this proves true.
Everything's for sale, my friend. Everything. If I had a sister, I'd sell her in a second.
I offer remedies for ailments both common and rare. Do let me know if I can be of service.
This here is Dragonsreach, an' it's my task to see it looks fit for a jarl, night an' day.
Everyone thinks Thorald is dead. But not me. I know my boy is alive out there. Somewhere...
My brother Jon's got the right of it - join the Bards College and avoid this pointless war.
But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red, when he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said...
Maybe a hardy Nord like you doesn't need a cure-all. Hmm? What about an invisibility potion?
Most of our weapons were crafted by Adrianne Avenicci. My woman's an artist, is what she is.
Oh, I always knew my Thorald was alive. Ain't a man in Skyrim who can keep a Gray-Mane down.
Really, I wish my girl would read more. It would certainly keep her out of all those fights.
You look like someone who knows how to wield a weapon. Well, you've come to the right place.
There's a rift here in Skyrim, and can't neither magic nor the passin' of time make it right.
I own the Pelagia Farm, just outside the city walls. Nimriel takes good care of things for me.
Imperials, Stormcloaks... I don't care who's in charge around here. I just want to make money!
When I became Steward, I had to give up the bottle. The people of the hold need me at my best.
Are you married? You look the type. Make sure you treat your wife with the respect she deserves.
I've got a hungry daughter to feed, so selling my produce is really the only thing I care about.
My wife's a good woman. She can be a little hard-headed sometimes, but I love her just the same.
You'll find tonics, salves, poultices and potions on my shelves. Browse to your heart's content.
Come see my collection of Gray-Mane's finest trinkets! You'll not find their like in all Tamriel!
Eorlund Gray-Mane's a stubborn fool. Our friendship ended when he turned his back on the Emperor.
I'd even buy one of your relatives, if you're looking to sell. Ha ha ha ha. That's a little joke.
If it's a lady you're looking for, you'd best look elsewhere. Once Mikael gets them, they're got.
You look like maybe you need a new weapon. Something big, perhaps? An axe maybe? Or a greatsword?
Ah... How my heart soars to look upon a sister Bosmer. Please, how can I serve your hunting needs?
Be glad you're here in the city, and not out in Riverwood. Those poor sods don't even have a wall.
I spend so much time among the dead, I sometimes forget how much I miss the company of the living.
It took me weeks to find that thieves' den. I can't stop now, and I can't get the sword on my own.
It's a miracle these Stormcloaks haven't robbed us blind yet. I'm sure it's only a matter of time.
It's my desire to enter the Bards College. My parents are hesitant, but I pray they let me attend.
Do you like horses? You  should visit the stables. I own them, you see. And our stock is excellent.
Eorlund and I... we both miss our son terribly. Thorald... he went missing, fighting the Imperials.
I had a bad time a few years back, an' I turned to drink. But Vignar, he wouldn't let me stay weak.
There's nothing a man can do that I can't do better, whether it's serving drinks or slaying trolls.
Welcome to Warmaiden's. Now don't let the name worry you - we got plenty o' steel for fightin' men.
Has the Empire forsaken us? How could Whiterun fall into the hands of these stinking half-wit Nords?
No doubt they still tell tales of Mikael and his sweet songs across Cyrodiil, where last I traveled.
And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade, as he told of bold battles and gold he had made!
Clan Battle-Born's got a proud lineage in Whiterun, but unlike the Gray-Manes, we've also got wealth.
Commander Cauis walks around Dragonsreach like a preening rooster. I could do his job blindfolded....
I'm as much a Nord as the next man, but I'm no fool. I don't live in the past, like those Gray-Manes.
Soldiers! They're everywhere these days. And not a one of them knows how to pick up after themselves.
There are those who would silence the Dragon's truth! But not I! Not Heimskr! His word will be known!
The task of Steward is more important than you realize. The Jarl often asks for my invaluable council.
And so then came the clashing and slashing of steel, as the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!
Damn those Gray-Manes to Oblivion. They want to back the Stormcloaks, they'll get what's comin' to 'em.
My friend Olava? The seer? She says things will get better for me, once I start sticking up for myself.
Forget Solitude or Windhelm. Whiterun was the crown jewel of Skyrim before... Well, before... Never mind.
I don't have much of a reputation in Skyrim yet, but I'm working on that, one sweet lady at a time. Haha!
My father never thought I was smart enough to be a stablemaster. I just wish he was around to see me now.
No! Please! I really don't have any money, Braith! I'll give you ten septims tomorrow. Just don't hit me.
Ah, kinsman. How my heart soars to look upon a brother Bosmer. Please, how can I serve your hunting needs?
Exile or no, my duty to Balgruuf remains. Keep that in mind when you approach him, for I will be watching.
He has returned... Oh, how Talos has returned. Helgen has been purged in his light. Will Whiterun be next?
Ripe fruit and fresh vegetables for sale! Straight from the fields and orchards of Whiterun to your table!
The cold, frightening truth is that the Empire represents progress. Anyone who fears progress is a coward.
There was a great battle here in Whiterun. It was quite thrilling! I must compose a song about it someday.
Come to Dragonsreach to discuss the ongoing hostilities, like the rest of the [QUOTE]great warriors[QUOTE]?
I've already put in a claim to the land and property you'll forfeit when you're found to be a collaborator.
Yesterday, I saw a dragon fly right over the city. Headed northeast. Toward Shearpoint, by the looks of it.
By the way, you might want to stop in at Warmaiden's. These days, folk need all the protection they can get.
I had my years of war and fighting. Senseless, all of it. All I want now is a rake and a patch of good soil.
I know what you're thinking: [QUOTE]This Belethor, how could he part with such magnificent treasures?[QUOTE]
Looking for my husband Nazeem? Check the Jarl's backside. That's usually where he stuffs himself these days.
Sometimes I miss the soldier's life, but when I hold my daughter in my arms, I know I made the right choice.
The circle of stones to the southwest? That's Secunda's Kiss. The giants hold it sacred, so tread carefully.
You'd be surprised how much work it is selling things at a stall. It's not all standing around and chatting.
And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no moooooree... when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!
Once I've made enough money trading with the Khajiit caravans, I'm going to buy the Bannered Mare from Hulda.
I take my duties as Housecarl very seriously. I won't hesitate to shed blood if my uncle Vignar is threatened.
I'm surprised you had the wits to notice, Olfrid, what with your nose buried so far up the Emperor's backside.
It seems this damnable conflict has claimed everyone's passions of late. Me, I prefer my books, and my spells.
I...I miss our son terribly, especially since Eorlund died. Thorald... he went missing, fighting the Imperials.
This was such a glorious city. But then everything had to change. The Empire came... and my brother was lost...
My bloodin' days might be over, but my son Idolaf is out there fightin' for Skyrim! Fightin' for the Empire! Ha!
Stupid Lars Battle-Born. I fight him almost every day, but it's not much of a fight, 'cause he don't fight back.
The Imperials silence us because they fear us! They are cowards! Cowards and fools who have forgotten the truth!
There's some company I certainly prefer over others. Have you met Mikael? The most amazing bard I've ever heard.
Ah, but Skyrim! Skyrim is supreme among all nations! Our people, our native people, are unmatched in all Tamriel!
I'll remember that when the Stormcloaks liberate the city. No amount of money will protect you then, Battle-Born.
The truth, child of Talos, is that the Dragon's children have come! To purge the world in fire and righteousness!
We Gray-Manes have been feuding with the Battle-Borns for years. There's no more bitter enemy than an old friend.
Eorlund Gray-Mane was a stubborn fool. Our friendship ended when he turned his back on the Emperor. Now he's dead.
I worry about the other settlements in the hold. Unwalled, lightly manned - prime targets for those damned dragons.
We Gray-Manes got just as much to be proud of as them Battle-Borns, but you won't see us with our noses in the air.
Avulstein Gray-Mane and I were best friends as children. If I see that traitor again, I'll throw him in jail myself!
Someone's been pilfering crops from my farm. If I find out it's one of your kin, I'll see the culprit rot in prison.
The Stormcloaks are content to live in the past forever. No wonder the Provincials think we're all baseless savages.
Men are all alike, from Skyrim to Hammerfell. They care only for war and politics, and treat their women like cattle.
The worship of Talos outlawed, and now the Thalmor come to conduct their witch-hunts while the Empire stands idly by.
Bold words, Battle-Born. While you're meting out justice to traitors, are you going to deal with the Emperor, as well?
My wife was a good woman. She could be a little hard-headed sometimes, but I loved her just the same. Gods I miss her.
Here you stand, talking to a married woman. Why? Am I that interesting? Or perhaps there are other things on your mind.
I'm a generous man, to those who treat me right. Might be I'll even let you live here with me, if you mind your manners.
My friend Maven and I - have you met Maven, in Riften? - we know our place in this world. Know the place of others, too.
Oh, it took years, but I earned my way to the top. I own Chillfurrow Farm, you see. Very successful business. Obviously.
I've heard you Gray-Manes are collaborating with the Stormcloaks. If I see any such treachery, I'll deal with you myself.
Want to hear a little Nord wisdom? You don't really know a woman 'til you've had a strong drink and a fistfight with her.
[QUOTE]Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead! Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed![QUOTE]
It's not easy being a woman in Skyrim, I know. But stay strong, and men will come to respect you, and maybe even fear you.
These are trying times for us all, I know. Many come to the Temple of Kynareth to pray, and I assist them as best I'm able.
People have forgotten humor, poetry and romance. I love a good sword fight as much as the next man, but there's more to life.
All I want it is to escape from this madness. And if Olfina can come with me, all the better. But I've probably said too much.
Here you stand, talking to a still grieving widow. Why? Am I that interesting? Or perhaps there are other things on your mind.
I miss the days when the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns got along. Ever since the war started, we've been at each others' throats.
Careful if you cross the river to the east. Old Hajvarr Iron-Hand and his brigands are holed up in that cave, White River Watch.
My daughter Braith says I read too much. [QUOTE]Play with me, mother![QUOTE] Girls need to learn how to take care of themselves.
Now I don't care about no deeds, or laws, or other nonsense like that. This house was empty, so I settled in. And now it's mine.
If you're heading east, steer clear of Hillgrund's Tomb. Thing about those old crypts - the dead having trouble staying that way.
Oh, I tell the future, all right. When I feel up to the task, that is. But I'm afraid my energies haven't quite peaked yet today.
I actually advise the Jarl on political matters. My input is invaluable, of course. But this is all probably a bit over your head.
I enjoy this work well enough, but I'm ready to retire. I've been thinking of selling the inn to Ysolda. Anyway, what do you need?
Lately it seems I am more nurse than priestess, tending to those who have suffered, both in mind and body, from this terrible war.
My brother takes council from Proventus Avenicci? What a laugh. He takes council from his daughter, and she's a bloody blacksmith.
My brother Jon had the right of it - join the Bards College and avoid this pointless war. Too bad he died before he had the chance.
There's a tranquility in magic, don't you think? It is simply energy, to be harnessed by those with the will and knowledge to do so.
Tired of bread and stew? Had enough of fish and fowl? Treat yourself and your kin to a choice cut of steak or a tender rack of ribs!
You think all the council my father provides the Jarl is his alone? Hmph. Let's just say I advise the advisor, and leave it at that.
We Nords are strong, and we're as tough as stone. But I'll bet you didn't know there's some of us with a good head for business, too.
You're not thinking of causing trouble here in this beautiful city, now are you? 'Cause I'd strongly advise against such foolishness.
By Ysmir, it's true. A jester - funny suit and all. Just north, by the Loreius Farm. Fool had a coffin in a cart, with a broken wheel.
I might just be a servant among lords, but don't think for a moment I don't take my duties as seriously as the jarl himself takes his!
Maybe some other time I'll reveal your destiny, hmm? Tea leaves, palm reading, crystal scrying... Oooh! Maybe trepanning? Ha ha ha ha.
I don't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun. Eorlund Gray-Mane was that and more, but now he's dead. All I ask is a fair chance.
I'm kept so busy, I don't get to see my daughter as often as I'd like. Perhaps you've met her? Adrianne? She owns the shop, Warmaiden's.
Rorikstead's a nice enough little hamlet, but a boring posting for a guard. If a dragon attacks, well... then it'll be a different story.
You know, I saw something near Shimmermist Cave, to the northeast. Some kind of creature... small and wicked. Never seen its like before.
Okay, okay! I'll leave him alone! I was just kidding around. Besides, if he'd only kiss me, I wouldn't have to beat him up all the time...
I spend a lot of time at the market stalls so I can learn the merchant's trade.  I need more experience if I'm going to run an inn someday.
I'll put it plainly. You can claim your sword, or you can keep your wife. If you set foot outside the gate, I won't be here when you return.
These Stormcloaks are ridiculous. They won't shop here because they think I'll sell them poisoned tonics. I should just go back to Cyrodiil.
I don't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun. Eorlund Gray-Mane's got that honor. Man's steel is legendary. All I ask is a fair chance.
As Whiterun's priest of Arkay, I spread his word whenever I'm able. In the meantime, most of my hours are spent with the city's dearly departed.
Well, sounds like you've had quite the journey, Uthgerd. But you were gone longer than usual. I got to thinking maybe you weren't coming back...
Ah, hello my good friend. Would you do me a kindness? I seem to be down to my last drop of spirits. Let me tell you, sobriety is highly overrated.
Thought did cross my mind, yeah. War brewing, talk of a riot in Helgen, and now jesters? Skyrim's gone mad, girl. You need to be careful out there.
Hmm....
Wait... who in blazes is this?
Any progress on finding the mask?
Why don't you go in there and get it?
Oh! Um, he he... Hold on... I... I can explain...
What are you waiting for? Get in there and find that mask.
Don't bother me if you haven't found anything about the mask.
Valmir, you rat. You're not a soldier at all! Must be one of the Thalmor!
You there! You look like a sympathetic soldier. I require your assistance!
Wait, it's haunted? I don't like ghosts... let me think about this for a minute...
Let's see... found the Dragon Cult... laid siege... people already dead... poisoned themselves... blah, blah, blah...  ah! Here it is!
So the Dragon Cult poisoned their own well, which explains the ghosts. However, Skorm thought the well was the key to entering the inner areas.
That all happened in the First Era, so the well should be clear of poison by now. It says the key to the well is likely somewhere in the crypt.
Hooray!
Free mead!
Another round, on me!
A round for all of my friends!
Let's hear it for our kind benefactor!
You heard the man! Drink and be merry!
Hrrrmm.
Indeed.
After a few minutes, she looked me dead in the eye and asked me if I wanted to join the Guild. Just like that, no apologies.
Jouane?
Yes, child?
Oooh, wonderful! I can't wait!
Oh! I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
By the Eight, keep your voice down! Do you want the entire village to learn our secrets?
I understand. I'm sorry. I just get so excited thinking about it. So... can we. Do some fire magic?
Hmph. Most certainly not. But perhaps I can teach you how to put some candles out. We'll start there.
Shh shh. It's fine, child. It's fine. But we must be cautious, hmm? What we do, the things I teach you. The others wouldn't understand.
I was just wondering. The next time we meet, do you think maybe you could teach me some fire magic? Nothing dangerous! Maybe a candle lighting spell?
Legate!
Be gone!
Good work!
We did it!
Rrrrraaaaa!
Hello friend.
